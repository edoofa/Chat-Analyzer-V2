179 - 05 Jan 2024 09:09AM - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.  May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head‚Äôs Contact.
180 - 05 Jan 2024 09:10AM - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head‚Äôs Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
181 - 05 Jan 2024 09:34AM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. Our next session will take place on Monday. I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!üå∫
182 - 05 Jan 2024 09:41AM - +27 74 372 5998: Good morning Ms Aditi how are you hope you are doing good I'm Lillian's Father i have been following all your discussions with my daughter . Your project is good but now we have a challenge on it cz now schools are closed in South Africa until 17/18 January so it's difficult to find a way to meet school heads at the present moment and I'm sure it will be bit easier when schools reopens so i think it's better to start from there.Another challenge is most of South African students they get what they call NESFAS schoolarship free from their Government so to go abroad is something else to them and it takes a lot of understanding for someone to change that, infact for us to come to Edoofa we were researching for International Universities and Schoolarship czmy daughter applied for many Universities in South Africa and still no response from them I'm sure cz she is a foreigner dispite her qualifications though some of the Citizens she applied with already have accepted.
183 - 05 Jan 2024 03:56PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day, and thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your understanding of the challenges posed by the current school closures in South Africa. I completely agree that waiting until the schools reopen in mid-January would be a more practical approach.
184 - 05 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Aditi Edoofa: And I totally get about the NESFAS scholarship but like your daughter there must be a lot of students who would be wanting to go the University but are not getting the opportunity, I would like her to keep trying to make the most out of the situation.
185 - 05 Jan 2024 06:22PM - +27 67 235 2935: Good evening Ms Aditi, I know our session is over at this time but I have managed to connect with a student and told her about the scholarship program and the student asked for the Edoofa scholarship program link and I don't have it with me, please kindly share the link",No,No

41 - 04 Jan 2024 05:47PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary of this document.  Due to the sudden shift in the economy that came with COVID pandemic one has to be aware of the jobs that are to be on demand in the future as well as be able to acquire the skills for the futures jobs on the market.  On the same note about acquiring skills one has to be aware that, there're emerging skills and enduring skills.  Emerging skills examples are data analysis, social media literacy,  online\digital skills and literary, remote teamwork and creative content writing.  Enduting skills are empathy, risk taking, decision making, business development and relationship building.  There are 3 projects i will be involved in, that will help me develop the skills mentioned above.  Project 1. Cooperate Alliances. In this active, I will have to Identify companies eg FinTechs, companies that deal in digital payments etc, identify decision makers in that company, reach out to companies, (this usually via LinkedIn as it is a professional tool), arranging for a call\video call between the  Edoofa team and client and finally facilitating the contract signing. Further one has to make an excel sheet that acts as a progress report.  Project 2. Community Building In this project one has to cultivate persuasion, negotiation and negotiating skills.

50 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - +263 78 714 6734: The person on the audio was explaining project one, which is cooperate alliance. He explained that with his help we would create a LinkedIn profile which will help me reach out to the target audience which are people in the tech industry, i would set up a meeting and help facilitate the meet such that the Edoofa team will tale over and explain better the project. Also this will help me gain the needed skills for the market ahead after graduation

I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.  As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!",No,No

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

I am Tafadzwa Bethel Matsiya and l am a proud Edoofian. I was very fortunate to be part of the Edoofa family which is a scholarship program that was founded by Mr Angaad sing. It provides for an opportunity for African students to study in India on half scholarship cover.  It also has got an added advantage for the students through it's Earn While You Learn program. This program allows for students to earn some scholarship credits that can be used to offset the fees balance that remain after the scholarship cover. I thought I should share this important information with you so that you can help me share this good news with students in your school. I am also going to share with you some other information with you that proves Edoofa is a genuine program that will not harm your students but only benefit them

23 - 05 Jan 2024 04:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Zoleka I hope you are doing well  Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your dedication to keeping me informed about your current circumstances. I understand that you are currently situated in rural areas facing network challenges, which has impacted your ability to actively participate in your EWYL projects. It's commendable that you are striving to overcome these obstacles.  I empathize with the limitations you are facing, especially regarding the absence of secondary schools in your current location and the difficulty in accessing the LinkedIn app. It's clear that you value your education and the opportunities that programs like Edoofa can offer.  Your commitment to staying determined and ambitious despite these challenges is truly admirable. It's important to acknowledge that circumstances beyond our control can sometimes create roadblocks, but your proactive approach in planning to resume active participation when you relocate to urban areas is a positive step forward.  In the meantime, I encourage you to explore alternative ways to stay engaged with your projects, even in the absence of a stable internet connection. Perhaps you can focus on offline activities or collaborate with local communities to contribute to your projects in meaningful ways.  Remember that setbacks are a part of any journey, and your resilience in facing these challenges will undoubtedly contribute to your personal and professional growth.",No,No

147 - 05 Jan 2024 04:55PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
148 - 05 Jan 2024 04:55PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
149 - 05 Jan 2024 04:55PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

151 - 05 Jan 2024 05:52PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

184 - 05 Jan 2024 02:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750 , this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650 .
185 - 05 Jan 2024 02:32PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650 . Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?",No,No

154 - 05 Jan 2024 10:05AM - +263 78 610 2677: Question 2  Thermodynamics specifically discusses how thermal energy is changed into or out of other types of energy. the 0 law states that when 2 objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, they are all in thermodynamic equilibrium, for example how hot water and cold water reach the same temperature when mixed or when a thermometer measures temperature. The first law states that the amount of energy in a system and its surroundings remains constant for example in photosynthesis, plants convert light into chemical energy by using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The second law states that entropy of an isolated system will always increase for example hot coffee cools down automatically while it cannot be hot again on its own. The third law also known as Nernst law states that when any system reaches absolute zero temperature, the entropy reaches a minimum constant value, for example turning steam to ice.
155 - 05 Jan 2024 10:06AM - +263 78 610 2677: Question 3  A valve is a device for controlling the flow of fluids in a pipe or enclosure. Butterfly valves are a family of quarter-turn rotational motion valves and are used primarily to stop, regulate, or start the flow of a fluid. They are used to isolate or regulate the flow of a fluid. Butterfly valves can also be used for backflow prevention in food manufacturing processes, as throttling valves to regulate large fluid flow, as constant load applicants to handle large volumes of fluids, as space restrictive applicants because the butterfly valve is the only type of valve that does not require large spaces. You can fit it in tight spaces unlike the other types of valves which are much bulkier. We can find butterfly valves in vacuum services, aerospace sectors, refrigeration and air conditioning, irrigation and agriculture needs, corrosive processing, lubrication, district heating, mining and shipyards, petroleum industries, wastewater treatment, slurry application, sprinkler and fire protection systems.
156 - 05 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 78 610 2677: Question 4  Heat treatment  can be referred to as the controlled process of cooling and heating of metals  and altering the physical or mechanical, or both, without altering the product structure. It may be done to refine the grain structure of the steel to improve machinability, tensile strength and structure of weld. Heat treatment may also be done to remove stains caused by cold working processes. It improves brittleness. Heat treatment increases strength, making the material ductile. It relieves stress, making the part easier to weld. Compatibility with other metals can be formed through magnetic and electrical properties by heat treatment. Heat treatment  introduces wear-resistant characteristics, either just to the surface or right through the part.it can improve the electrical and magnetic properties of a metal, which will improve its compatibility with other metals. Heat treatment can help in altering the mechanical or chemical properties of metals, which may help in the manufacturing of certain products.
157 - 05 Jan 2024 10:08AM - +263 78 610 2677: Question 5  A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. The different types of compressors include reciprocating compressors, rotary screw compressors, centrifugal compressors, axial compressors, mixed flow, free piston gas generator, centripetal and scroll compressors. The compressors used in a gas turbine are centrifugal, axial, mixed flow, free piston gas generator, reciprocating and centripetal. These compressors are used in gas turbines because they have high performance, high reliability, and flexible operation during the flight envelope. They also have high efficiency and large mass flow rate. The compressors increase the pressure of incoming air before it enters the combustor and also supply air in sufficient quantity to satisfy the requirements of the combustion burners. The compressor is also necessary for the engine to produce static thrust, as the pressure gradient gives the engine a preferred direction of air flow. <This message was edited>

154 - 05 Jan 2024 05:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with us, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
155 - 05 Jan 2024 05:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
156 - 05 Jan 2024 05:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
157 - 05 Jan 2024 05:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
158 - 05 Jan 2024 05:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.",No,Yes

194 - 05 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
195 - 05 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
196 - 05 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
197 - 05 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +263 78 880 5139: Yes i am.
198 - 05 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
199 - 05 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
200 - 05 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
201 - 05 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
202 - 05 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.",No,Yes

193 - 05 Jan 2024 01:57PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
194 - 05 Jan 2024 02:05PM - Dev Edoofa: we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
195 - 05 Jan 2024 02:05PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
196 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yea I do remember and will pay sit before the due date
197 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - +263 78 988 6123: That's great sir
214 - 05 Jan 2024 02:53PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I would  appreciate that
215 - 05 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
216 - 05 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
217 - 05 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
218 - 05 Jan 2024 02:59PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I do agree
219 - 05 Jan 2024 03:27PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
220 - 05 Jan 2024 03:27PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
221 - 05 Jan 2024 03:27PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?

214 - 05 Jan 2024 01:26PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education
215 - 05 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?

217 - 05 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
218 - 05 Jan 2024 01:40PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir
219 - 05 Jan 2024 01:58PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
220 - 05 Jan 2024 01:58PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
221 - 05 Jan 2024 01:58PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
222 - 05 Jan 2024 02:04PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah I do agree with this sir
223 - 05 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
252 - 05 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
253 - 05 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
254 - 05 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
255 - 05 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
256 - 05 Jan 2024 02:57PM - +263 71 401 8032: I think this is any amazing Idea sir. It sounds great.
257 - 05 Jan 2024 03:18PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
258 - 05 Jan 2024 03:21PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes you are very correct. What will happen after those 10 months
259 - 05 Jan 2024 03:29PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
260 - 05 Jan 2024 03:29PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
261 - 05 Jan 2024 03:29PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
263 - 05 Jan 2024 03:42PM - +263 71 401 8032: Edoofa did very well in planning this I must say
264 - 05 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much. We appreciate your compliment.
265 - 05 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
266 - 05 Jan 2024 03:49PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir . It is understandable but I have this one question sir
267 - 05 Jan 2024 03:50PM - +263 71 401 8032: Sir this $150 dollars we will be depositing every month for 10 months is possible to work for it in the EWYL programme or it can only be paid by my parents
268 - 05 Jan 2024 04:08PM - Dev Edoofa: Wynne, the Financial Secure Plan is planned with respect to the EWYL program. The basic agenda behind this plan is to prepare you and your parents for the finances of your higher eductaion here in India. Along with the EWYL program, let me explain it to you in a better way:
269 - 05 Jan 2024 04:09PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir thank you thank you
270 - 05 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Dev Edoofa: Consider, your yearly fees for higher education is $3000. Now, EWYL program may help you prepare for the finances of 1 year. But in the long run or over the further years, you may not be able to prepare . That is why, we came up with the Financial Secure Plan. This plan will prepare you better with overall finances of your higher education.
271 - 05 Jan 2024 04:13PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope I was able to make you understand!

216 - 05 Jan 2024 05:48PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
217 - 05 Jan 2024 05:48PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*  1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.  2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.  3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.  4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
218 - 05 Jan 2024 05:48PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
219 - 05 Jan 2024 06:07PM - +265 882 64 75 93: We may proceed Ms kirti
220 - 05 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -  *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and JCE results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
226 - 05 Jan 2024 06:17PM - +265 882 64 75 93: You may proceed i understand quite well
227 - 05 Jan 2024 06:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
228 - 05 Jan 2024 06:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
229 - 05 Jan 2024 06:20PM - +265 882 64 75 93: This message was deleted
230 - 05 Jan 2024 06:20PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes it does
231 - 05 Jan 2024 06:42PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
232 - 05 Jan 2024 06:42PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
233 - 05 Jan 2024 06:42PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024.

I plan to venture into business here in Zimbabwe without including higher education. Of course higher education in a prestigious country like India is of great value, though pursuing in business is heartfelt and right for me. I nolonger want the program l have chosen. All this will help in my favor and my parents' too since money is being a difficulty to them. Hence, l can lessen their burden through this plan which will also be part of my long term goals.

Your choice to follow a path that feels right and heartfelt to you is commendable.

9 - 05 Jan 2024 05:54AM - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings!! The business does not contribute to the career l once wanted to pursue in. It was something in me though l wanted to go through higher education first but after considering the financial status at home and also the years l would have been in university against what l can achieve if only l have the capital to venture into this business in those three years it would be meaningful to me. Of course l have specific business ideas that l am passionate about and with God's grace they can be achieved without going for higher education.

Certainly, Leroy, I completely comprehend that under the given circumstances, you might naturally lean toward the decision to withdraw from the scholarship. If this is the choice you've made, I fully respect your decision. However, there's still a question that is unanswered regarding the initial reasons behind your enrollment. When your parents enrolled you, they undoubtedly had specific aspirations or reasons in mind. If it's not too much to ask, could you kindly share with me what initially motivated you to pursue higher education in India?",No,No

However, due to circumstances beyond our control as a family we have decided to withdraw from this programme.  We regret any incomvenience caused in this regard.  Thank you.
2 - 21 Dec 2023 09:10PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Natasha.  I hope you are doing well. I appreciate you letting me know about your decision to potentially leave the program. It's completely your right to make this decision as a family, and I respect that. However, I must admit that I'm a bit disheartened because of the reason Natasha initially gave. If your concerns are about our authenticity, I'm eager to address any doubts you might have. We are committed to ensuring Natasha's future and I distinctly recall the case she shared above. If you'd like to discuss this further, we're more than willing to talk.
3 - 21 Dec 2023 09:11PM - Kirti Edoofa: An organization that has bad intentions would likely avoid open discussions, but that's not our approach here because we are confident if this would have been the case why would more than 3000+ students trust us and would be in India under our program. If there are other worries or questions you have, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with me.

There are two divisions of agriculture, subsistence and commercial farming which roughly correspond to the less developed and more developed countries. Contemporary practices subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and part of Asia and Latin America. Subsistence farmers farm for survival, and usually do not look to make a profit off the crops that they grow. Commercial agriculture is practised virtually whenever it is capable of growing crops or raising livestock, but primarily in areas with the highest growth potential. It is usually found in more developed countries, and the crops are grown in huge quantities to support entire populations for a profit. Subsistence farming, form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer's family, leaving little, if any surplus for sale or trade. Commercial farming heps countries in the world earn a high foreign exchange. It is being purely for profit. It is also used for commercial use including cafeterias, restaurant and soup kitchen.

27 - 05 Jan 2024 07:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!  *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*  1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.  2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.  3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.  4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
28 - 05 Jan 2024 07:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*  5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.  6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.  7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29 - 05 Jan 2024 07:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*

33 - 05 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
34 - 05 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.

36 - 05 Jan 2024 08:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*  I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
37 - 05 Jan 2024 08:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
38 - 05 Jan 2024 08:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?

11 - 05 Jan 2024 07:58PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12 - 05 Jan 2024 07:58PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
13 - 05 Jan 2024 07:59PM - +263 77 339 4607: Clear
14 - 05 Jan 2024 08:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
15 - 05 Jan 2024 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?",No,No

32 - 05 Jan 2024 06:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
33 - 05 Jan 2024 06:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
34 - 05 Jan 2024 07:29PM - +263 77 466 6432: Yes It does
35 - 05 Jan 2024 08:17PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
36 - 05 Jan 2024 08:17PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.

37 - 05 Jan 2024 08:17PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

22 mins","23 - 05 Jan 2024 07:11PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
24 - 05 Jan 2024 07:11PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
25 - 05 Jan 2024 07:11PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
26 - 05 Jan 2024 07:11PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27 - 05 Jan 2024 07:15PM - +263 77 842 2583: It's a huge relief on my part and it will go a long way in reducing the burden
28 - 05 Jan 2024 07:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29 - 05 Jan 2024 07:49PM - +263 77 842 2583: Correct
30 - 05 Jan 2024 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
31 - 05 Jan 2024 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
32 - 05 Jan 2024 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

33 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - +263 77 842 2583: Very logical and to my advantage
34 - 05 Jan 2024 08:14PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
35 - 05 Jan 2024 08:25PM - +263 77 842 2583: The financial plan I have fully understood
36 - 05 Jan 2024 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
37 - 05 Jan 2024 08:37PM - +263 77 842 2583: Sunday I will be traveling taking my kids back to school, Monday will leave them at school. Tuesday, will spend the day at my rural home, network is a problem. Wednesday I will be traveling back. I think Thursday will be back in Kariba and we can continue at 6PM
38 - 05 Jan 2024 08:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, may I know if we shall contiue on Thursday?",No,Yes

I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. I can also see that you have seen my messages.

They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.
62 - 05 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.  Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
63 - 05 Jan 2024 06:41PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes we do
64 - 05 Jan 2024 06:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
65 - 05 Jan 2024 06:43PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
66 - 05 Jan 2024 07:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
67 - 05 Jan 2024 07:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
68 - 05 Jan 2024 07:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
69 - 05 Jan 2024 07:13PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet thank you
70 - 05 Jan 2024 07:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
69 - 05 Jan 2024 07:13PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet thank you
70 - 05 Jan 2024 07:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
71 - 05 Jan 2024 07:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
72 - 05 Jan 2024 07:14PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
73 - 05 Jan 2024 07:16PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet
74 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
75 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
76 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
77 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
78 - 05 Jan 2024 08:07PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet that's right
76 - 05 Jan 2024 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.

78 - 05 Jan 2024 08:07PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet that's right
79 - 05 Jan 2024 08:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
80 - 05 Jan 2024 08:16PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet please do
81 - 05 Jan 2024 08:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
82 - 05 Jan 2024 08:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?

74 - 05 Jan 2024 06:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Moving forward in our today‚Äôs session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

79 - 05 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
80 - 05 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
81 - 05 Jan 2024 07:17PM - +263 77 211 5284: Yes they are
82 - 05 Jan 2024 07:28PM - +263 77 756 5352: They are clear
83 - 05 Jan 2024 08:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
84 - 05 Jan 2024 08:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

3 - 05 Jan 2024 04:35PM - +263 71 257 6605: Good day sir. Definitely wanted to proceed with the registration but surely things in Zimbabwe have fallen apart. The economy is dysfunctional and raising the required funds is a challenge. Dont know if the situation can be helped.
4 - 05 Jan 2024 07:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The current situation in Zimbabwe has indeed presented significant challenges, particularly in terms of the economic instability, making it difficult to raise the required funds for the registration. May I know if you have made any plans on regards to the higher education?

I was hoping to get a response from your end the past couple of days so that we can reconnect with each other and understand how you as a family have been.  While I was organizing my day today, I went through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee before 31st December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee?

49 - 05 Jan 2024 08:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
50 - 05 Jan 2024 08:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
51 - 05 Jan 2024 08:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.

So for me to pay every month it's not workable. But if I can be allowed to pay whatever amount whenever I get a chance, it will be fine with me.
54 - 05 Jan 2024 08:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Certainly, we can work on alternatives at the time of the final settlement.

56 - 05 Jan 2024 08:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
57 - 05 Jan 2024 08:55PM - +263 77 210 6331: Yes sir
58 - 05 Jan 2024 08:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.",No,Yes

13 - 04 Jan 2024 07:51PM - +263 77 742 7613: Yesterday I went to Tinotenda's  wanted to do payment plan for her fees.I discussed with the administration block about the scholarship enrollment for Tinotenda and briefed them were we are now .They were aware about Edoofa scholarship but  they had some questions about the program of Earn While you learn program.They figured out that some of their past students who came there ,they didn't  go through that process .They said when their student got a scholarship, the school (organizing staff )with the board of Edoofa  create a group.They also highlighted that one of their head boy  who was in A level got a scholarship last year and the school was aware of that  but for Tinotenda it was a new scenario.They asked me to come back on Tuesday and meet the Principal . Sorry for the inconveniences are you aware of Tinotenda's school. 2.Which team of the Edoofa visited the school ,if  you can give me their names  maybe it will be much of help .
14 - 04 Jan 2024 09:02PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update and for visiting Tinotenda's school on behalf of the Edoofa scholarship.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
154 - 05 Jan 2024 04:24PM - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa‚Äôs Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

48 - 05 Jan 2024 04:00PM - +263 77 715 6653: You can just give me the details  of the cost  so that l can show  her
49 - 05 Jan 2024 04:15PM - Garima Edoofa: For me to align with your thoughts what exactly do you mean by a fully funded scholarship?
50 - 05 Jan 2024 04:36PM - +263 77 715 6653: Where one is just  given the opportunity  to attend  school without  payment   as an offer
51 - 05 Jan 2024 04:41PM - +263 77 715 6653: That will be a fully  funded  scholarship
52 - 05 Jan 2024 04:58PM - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  1. Scholarships 2. Sponsorships  Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

104 - 05 Jan 2024 11:22AM - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
105 - 05 Jan 2024 03:41PM - +263 78 861 2112: Okay maam  As you know Zimbabwe is a developing economy operating under economic sanctions at the same time suffering high rates of unemployment and inflation respectively.  Studying abroad would give me an opportunity to tackle the effects of unemployment faced in my home country and I would get a chance to be employed elsewhere.  Also studying abroad delights me an opportunity to interact with people from various parts of the world and would get to learn foreign language as well as cultures of other countries.
106 - 05 Jan 2024 03:56PM - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
107 - 05 Jan 2024 04:04PM - +263 78 861 2112: Okay..  I want to make use of the differences between the 2 educational systems.. (the Indian and the Zimbabwean educational systems) to come up with an improvement of the educational system in my home country.  I.e copy and improve(if possible)  Therefore, seeing and learning how other countries operate would   enable me to implement the plan
108 - 05 Jan 2024 04:08PM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Tapiwanashe, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
195 - 05 Jan 2024 06:41PM - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
196 - 05 Jan 2024 06:49PM - +263 78 861 2112: I understand Ms Garima
197 - 05 Jan 2024 06:50PM - Garima Edoofa: Tapiwanashe, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
198 - 05 Jan 2024 07:26PM - +263 78 861 2112: Ok  The application process is around 1500-2250USD so Edoofa, In a bid to make it affordable for the student it charges the student $350 for inclusion In the program and it will assist the student in Applications to universites and EWYL
199 - 05 Jan 2024 07:29PM - +263 78 861 2112: Due to COVID-19 Edoofa has reduced this amount from 750 to 350 USD and If the students parents can not afford the sum they. Can pay 200USD for the first 7 days and then 150 in the next 30 days
200 - 05 Jan 2024 10:04PM - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350   *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

100 - 05 Jan 2024 10:26AM - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263781991982 @263775679972 , Hope you are doing well.
101 - 05 Jan 2024 10:26AM - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with your counseling session, shall we start?

103 - 05 Jan 2024 10:49AM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
104 - 05 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Garima Edoofa: Amazing Violet  As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
105 - 05 Jan 2024 12:08PM - +263 78 199 1982: No
106 - 05 Jan 2024 12:12PM - Garima Edoofa: @263781991982let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
107 - 05 Jan 2024 12:16PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
108 - 05 Jan 2024 12:26PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes we can afford it
126 - 05 Jan 2024 01:03PM - +263 78 199 1982: noted
127 - 05 Jan 2024 01:06PM - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
128 - 05 Jan 2024 01:07PM - Garima Edoofa: You see during our founder‚Äôs visit this year, we encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  It's evident from these experiences that many students regret not taking the benefit of The Edoofa Program's opportunity earlier. As your counselor, I understand the challenges in your home country. What are your thoughts or insights on this situation, Violet?
129 - 05 Jan 2024 01:13PM - Garima Edoofa: @263781991982
130 - 05 Jan 2024 01:25PM - +263 78 199 1982: The fact that these people were seen as capable by the Edoofa program gives them the experience and knowledge to be independent even without having studied abroad as they desired.Lack of financial support does not put their guard down as they can also use their knowledge Edoofa program had provided.Yes,we face a lot of financial challenges in our country but considering the knowledge students had received from Edoofa program they can use their experience to be financially independent people
131 - 05 Jan 2024 01:42PM - Garima Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
132 - 05 Jan 2024 01:43PM - +263 78 199 1982: Yes
133 - 05 Jan 2024 01:44PM - Garima Edoofa: Violet as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
134 - 05 Jan 2024 01:47PM - +263 78 199 1982: $1 500-$2 250
135 - 05 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly Violet, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.",No,No

You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
113 - 05 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
114 - 05 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating?

124 - 05 Jan 2024 11:08AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
125 - 05 Jan 2024 11:18AM - +260 97 3079914: Well Edoofa is really a good program and is inspiring. And I think it is a good and efficient program of acquiring good jobs. And definitely, I think it will Benefit me so much.
126 - 05 Jan 2024 11:49AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Bupe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
127 - 05 Jan 2024 11:59AM - +260 97 3079914: Thank you. It really is useful
128 - 05 Jan 2024 12:15PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

156 - 05 Jan 2024 12:15PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
157 - 05 Jan 2024 12:17PM - +260 97 3079914: It definitely is
158 - 05 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Gurvinder: Alright Bupe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
159 - 05 Jan 2024 12:46PM - +260 97 3079914: Yes
160 - 05 Jan 2024 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
161 - 05 Jan 2024 12:48PM - +260 97 3079914: Not really but yes we have discussed
162 - 05 Jan 2024 01:02PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?",No,Yes

15 - 05 Jan 2024 01:07PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16 - 05 Jan 2024 01:07PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*",No,Yes

98 - 05 Jan 2024 12:51PM - +260 770717770: After being educated from abroad i believe that I would use what I have learnt to help my country in the education sector in the following ways. I would help spread the importance of learning, understanding and utilizing technology, and spread awareness on how technology can make our day to day life easier, I would help improve the way pupils learning by helping them know the importance of using devices like laptops and  other useful devices in places that they aren't available. This is because there high levels of computer illiteracy in my country and not everyone can have access to computers in their schools so iam planning to change this and help make technology accessible to everyone. My country also lacks enough people to teach them on advanced courses and subjects to do with computer studies iam planning to help teach people about computers and having being exposed to a country abroad I would inform people on how other countries are utilizing computers and what good technology had done for them.

14 - 05 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
15 - 05 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16 - 05 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

Parents should also provide information on transport situation and also information on looking for employment after graduation. As a parent we should explore interest and strength of my child. Parent should be involved in financial planning by coming up with a budget.  Encourage independence by taking responsibility for their decision making. Parents should be flexible and open minded if your child‚Äôs interest or goals changes during their University studies, that is adopting to changing circumstances.

I absolutely love working under pressure. My highest education level is A level . I did a crash course for my A level I wrote sooner than expected. The course I‚Äôm looking forward to studying is mechatronics engineering or chemical engineering I‚Äôm stuck between these two though I‚Äôm really passionate about both. My dads an Accountant by profession and my moms a stay at home mom who does various things at different times. My dad‚Äôs highest level of education was university and my moms was O level. My dad has been supporting me for my education up until now but it hasn‚Äôt been consistent our relationship is not stable at all some months he would simply refuse to pay for my fees and I would end up just being at home. My extended family said they would try to make sure I have fees for my higher education as well as my sister because my dad is unpredictable. I have 2 siblings the first is an IT specialist and an author the second is a university student she‚Äôs now in her third year. For my last 2 years of highschool I went to a private institution whereby you‚Äôre able to have one on one lessons with a tutor since I was doing a crash course per month we payed $220 which meant per term it would be $660.

Elizabeth got a chance to connect with different Edoofa councillors whom she said they were patient enough to teach their students about all they want to know to study abroad. She also had a chance to do interviews with the director of Edoofa and she is very thankful about the help she got from the  councilors, and she was found eligible.  Elizabeth believe that Edoofa give students education and emotional support but not only that, Edoofa also help students to get scholarships, so with the help of Edoofa, Elizabeth is enrolled at a great University in India where she is persuing her career.

16 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
17 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18 - 05 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*",No,No

198 - 05 Jan 2024 09:28AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!  ‚Äú*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*‚Äù  Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
199 - 05 Jan 2024 10:18AM - +263 71 465 0030: Morning how are you Mr Gurvinder
200 - 05 Jan 2024 11:05AM - Gurvinder: I am fine, Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
201 - 05 Jan 2024 11:05AM - Gurvinder: Tatenda basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
202 - 05 Jan 2024 11:05AM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
203 - 05 Jan 2024 11:11AM - +263 71 465 0030: Okay sir
204 - 05 Jan 2024 11:44AM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?

If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.  Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.  The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa‚Äôs Associated Universities, etc.  The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
208 - 05 Jan 2024 12:07PM - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child‚Äôs tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa‚Äôs Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*

17 - 05 Jan 2024 01:04PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18 - 05 Jan 2024 01:04PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*",No,No

83 - 05 Jan 2024 10:44AM - +263 71 753 0530: No i only had researched in mining engineering and here in Zimbabwe i was eligible to do the program
84 - 05 Jan 2024 12:08PM - Kunal: Mining is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world‚Äôs economy, it is unclear whether mining will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line.  One of the primary reasons why mining may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world‚Äôs reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment.  Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining and other professionals in the field.  In conclusion, mining may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
19 - 05 Jan 2024 10:37AM - +263 77 168 2406: My name is Portia Chidemo mother to Adonis. I am married to Mr Tinashe Simoyi. I am a holder of a Bachelor of Accountancy Honours Degree as well as a holder of a Post Graduate Diploma in Education. We are currently based in Harare. We run a small family business that enables us to take care of our family's everyday needs. My motivation lies in the fact that I believe Education liberates a person. Without Education you are irrelevant in this evolving world. It also comes from the fact that our children are the leaders of tomorrow hence we should equip them well so that they become independent
20 - 05 Jan 2024 10:54AM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing your background and motivations. It's inspiring to hear about your academic achievements and your commitment to your family. Your perspective on education as a liberating force and a crucial element in navigating the evolving world resonates deeply. Your dedication to equipping your children for future leadership and independence is commendable.
21 - 05 Jan 2024 10:54AM - Kunal: I would like to share that Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic‚Äôs Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

64 - 05 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*

70 - 05 Jan 2024 01:50PM - Kunal: Good to hear that Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the  *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
71 - 05 Jan 2024 01:50PM - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.   The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
72 - 05 Jan 2024 01:50PM - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

158 - 05 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Kunal: Tsitsi, let me guide you ahead When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria.  In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.  Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?

203 - 05 Jan 2024 10:59AM - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

436 - 05 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

10 - 05 Jan 2024 11:40AM - Sahil Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11 - 05 Jan 2024 11:40AM - Sahil Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*  The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms. After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world‚Äôs second-largest higher education space.*  Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

306 - 05 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need. <This message was edited>

307 - 05 Jan 2024 01:03PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

42 - 05 Jan 2024 11:49AM - Sahil Edoofa: Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Africa for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zambia,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zambia is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
43 - 05 Jan 2024 12:39PM - +260 96 9573792: We agree....its very expensive. Today i actually got to find out at one of the universities in Zambia called Texila American University.....per semester they pay k20,000

Registration fee should be paid by us 5. Visa fees should be paid by us as well. 6. Earn while you learn is provided (earning scholarship credits and not cash or salary)

Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19 - 05 Jan 2024 09:47AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*  The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms. After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world‚Äôs second-largest higher education space.*  Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

26 - 05 Jan 2024 11:37AM - +260 96 8775080: I was at Dominican convent secondary school. In grade 9,I passed my exams with  509, I was accepted back to my previous school and was put in a pure science class. I have written my grade 12 final exams and  l am waiting for my results. I was a member of badminton and debate club. I was the president of my debate club. I am a very good leader,  I love learning new skills to develop myself and I enjoy meeting new people. My  parents both went to school but ended in grade 12. I come from a broken family, my father is unemployed and my mother is mentally sick. I was taken in by my widowed aunt  with four daughters who raised me. Therefore I do not want to end up like my parents.  I want to work hard and do better. Because I know with good education there are a lot of opportunities for employment. Both formal and informal.
27 - 05 Jan 2024 11:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about your situation, Antoinette. I hope God will provide you with the strength to fight through adversity.
28 - 05 Jan 2024 12:20PM - +260 96 8775080: Thank you
29 - 05 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Antoinette. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. I'm truly impressed by your active involvement in extracurricular activities, such as being a member of the badminton and debate club, and particularly serving as the president of your debate club, showcasing your leadership skills. Your enthusiasm for learning new skills and personal development is commendable. Your ability to enjoy meeting new people reflects a positive and open-minded approach! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed light on the profession your Aunt pertains to, please?

35 - 05 Jan 2024 01:01PM - +260 97 7340902: Am 52 years old. A mother of two girls. Im an accountant by profession and a holder of a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting as well as a Diploma in Financial Administration. Apart from my daughter's I have raised 3 other daughters namely Antoinette here and two other girls for my sister. I have seen that education is a great equalizer as am the bread winner in my family. I promised myself to support my siblings children when I saw they could not. I can proudly say that as at today all the girls have completed grade 12. This is how I have supported Antoinette so that she gains economic independence for her future wellbeing.
36 - 05 Jan 2024 01:26PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your commitment to education and your role as a dedicated accountant reflect a commendable blend of professional excellence and personal generosity. Holding a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and a Diploma in Financial Administration is a testament to your academic prowess and commitment to mastering the intricacies of your field. Your decision to extend your support beyond your immediate family, fostering the education of your sister's children and others, highlights your understanding of the transformative power of education as a great equalizer. Your efforts as the breadwinner in your family demonstrate not only financial responsibility but also a deep sense of care and dedication to the well-being and future success of those under your guidance, Mrs. Maureen!
37 - 05 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Antoinette's education abroad?
38 - 05 Jan 2024 02:42PM - +260 97 7340902: Thank you so much. I have great interest in the welfare of Antoinette as evidenced by my support from pre school til now. If she is taken on and depending on the kind of scholarship she is given, I would be the one.

35 - 05 Jan 2024 01:01PM - +260 97 7340902: Am 52 years old. A mother of two girls. Im an accountant by profession and a holder of a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting as well as a Diploma in Financial Administration. Apart from my daughter's I have raised 3 other daughters namely Antoinette here and two other girls for my sister. I have seen that education is a great equalizer as am the bread winner in my family. I promised myself to support my siblings children when I saw they could not. I can proudly say that as at today all the girls have completed grade 12. This is how I have supported Antoinette so that she gains economic independence for her future wellbeing.
36 - 05 Jan 2024 01:26PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your commitment to education and your role as a dedicated accountant reflect a commendable blend of professional excellence and personal generosity. Holding a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and a Diploma in Financial Administration is a testament to your academic prowess and commitment to mastering the intricacies of your field. Your decision to extend your support beyond your immediate family, fostering the education of your sister's children and others, highlights your understanding of the transformative power of education as a great equalizer. Your efforts as the breadwinner in your family demonstrate not only financial responsibility but also a deep sense of care and dedication to the well-being and future success of those under your guidance, Mrs. Maureen!

One standout example is the development of affordable and innovative vaccines, such as those for diseases like rotavirus and hepatitis B. Indian biotech firms have demonstrated expertise in genetic engineering, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural biotechnology, with advancements in crop improvement and disease resistance. The country's biotech companies have also played a pivotal role in global collaborations and partnerships, fostering research and development initiatives that address pressing global challenges. The success of India's biotechnological sector reflects a commitment to scientific excellence, ethical practices, and a focus on delivering impactful solutions for the betterment of global health and agriculture!
230 - 05 Jan 2024 02:36PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
231 - 05 Jan 2024 03:51PM - +263 71 233 2879: I appreciate your question, and I apologize for not having specific information about the cost of higher education for international students.
232 - 05 Jan 2024 03:53PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Fortune! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

356 - 05 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please!
357 - 05 Jan 2024 01:41PM - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Mercia  @263718828160 As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Anotida was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
358 - 05 Jan 2024 01:41PM - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Anotida's potential. I firmly believe that if students like him are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
359 - 05 Jan 2024 01:49PM - +263 71 882 8160: Waal, thus great news indeed

17 - 05 Jan 2024 02:47PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
18 - 05 Jan 2024 02:47PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
