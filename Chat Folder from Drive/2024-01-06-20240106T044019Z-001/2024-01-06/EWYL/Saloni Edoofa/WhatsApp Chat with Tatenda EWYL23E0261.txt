28/12/23, 10:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Tatenda- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
28/12/23, 10:24 AM - +263 77 822 9060: Okay . So the first project is Corporate Alliances .
This project requires students to research about different companies with different networking systems that promote the development to be made by the young people . The key point I learned was that one has to be ready to be either rejected by some companies and be sure to try again until one gets what they want
28/12/23, 10:28 AM - +263 77 822 9060: The second project is Community Building .
This project requires the students to have a network where they share more about Edoofa to people around them and internationally.  The students would also be able to create a social impact for themselves and others
28/12/23, 10:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You are answering it really well, you have got all my attention with such detailed understanding.
28/12/23, 10:33 AM - +263 77 822 9060: The third project is African Schools Education Reform Mission. 
This project focuses more on the student presenting opportunities to different students from different schools thus the project goes international . The students are to present or educate the owner of the school/s on Edoofa and the opportunities it has to give to students once the principal or headmaster is convinced the students then sets up a video/call for both parties and the networking system expands for Edoofa.
28/12/23, 10:34 AM - +263 77 822 9060: In all these projects the students get credit earnings
28/12/23, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is absolutely marvelous Tatenda, you have shared such an in-depth understanding that is beyond appreciation🥳🥺🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there

2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is spectacular, I like how specific you are and Tatenda I promise you to contribute as much as possible from my end beyond being your mentor🫶🏻
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Coming back to the session, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

2/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 822 9060: I've learned that the project that mostly uses a LinkedIn account is the Corporate Alliances projects . The account helps one identify the different companies to know about according to the business one may be interested in

3/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 822 9060: I have come to understand that when searching for companies , one should search those that will be helping students with anything that has to do with media thus the company should be not too big or too small it should have 50-200 members being part of it . One has to research the about of the founder, more about the company if it's newly formed and if it promotes employment of students.
3/1/24, 9:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Tatenda, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
3/1/24, 9:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

5/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 822 9060: The next project is Community Building.  This project helps students socialize more with people their age especially those that would have graduated from their secondary schools so those students who are part of Edoofa get a chance to present an opportunity to African students on the Edoofian program through social media and  getting in touch in person .Thus Edoofa helps the Edoofian students to develop their way to spread the word into helping students who are in need of such an  opportunity  . Lastly there are scholarship credits that are earned by the Edoofian for signing up students which is $20
and $5 to make the students efforts to be availed to the ones that would have been told about the program <This message was edited>

5/1/24, 10:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

*Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *Tatenda/Saloni/5JAN2024*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 822 9060: That would be helpful
5/1/24, 10:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Execution:
*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.
5/1/24, 10:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
5/1/24, 10:58 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.
