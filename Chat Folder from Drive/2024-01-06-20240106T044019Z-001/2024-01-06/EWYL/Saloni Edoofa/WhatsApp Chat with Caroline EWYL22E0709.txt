26/12/23, 8:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Caroline,
How are you?
26/12/23, 8:11 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Caroline, this student that you referred, his due date to pay the enrollment fees is tomorrow. I am sure you will connect with him and congratulate him on his selection by the Academic Board of Edoofa. Along with that, also enquired about the status of his payment.
26/12/23, 11:14 AM - +91 6284 066 187: Okay thank you
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Caroline,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is an advance wish since along with you, our organization will be occupied in New Year celebrations from tomorrow till 1st January, Monday, so I will share your session schedule post that.

I pray for your good health, wealth, and success, and yes,

_*see you next year👋🏼*_
29/12/23, 3:46 PM - +91 6284 066 187: See you next year
