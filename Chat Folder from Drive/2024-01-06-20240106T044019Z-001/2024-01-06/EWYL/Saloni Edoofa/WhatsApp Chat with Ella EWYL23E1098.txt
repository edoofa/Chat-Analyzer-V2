5/1/24, 1:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that, way too good, and I am so impressed by this🫶🏻
5/1/24, 1:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: May you please tell me the objectives
5/1/24, 1:44 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Thank you Ms saloni
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 1:55 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Well understood
5/1/24, 2:01 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/1/24, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what did you grasp from it?
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: What i got from the screenshot is that this student is now financial independent and this is all thanks to you,Ms saloni and the team.Therefore your guidance and mentorship has been a great help to his life and career.
5/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: And also because of this program he has managed to pay his tuition fees
5/1/24, 2:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I am sure Ella that we will achieve milestones even higher🫶🏻
