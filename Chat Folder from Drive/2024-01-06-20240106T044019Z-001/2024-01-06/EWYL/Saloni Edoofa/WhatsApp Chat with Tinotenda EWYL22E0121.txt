How are you?
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume from the new year onwards, currently, we have given you time to enjoy this festive season but primarily, prepare well for your exams.
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, how are your exams going?
27/12/23, 10:05 AM - +91 78891 60553: Okay mam thank you
27/12/23, 10:06 AM - +91 78891 60553: They are okay mam thank you for asking.

27/12/23, 1:00 PM - +91 78891 60553: They were ok mam
28/12/23, 8:19 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tinotenda,
How are you?
28/12/23, 8:21 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I wanted to discuss the upcoming Industrial visit with you like how you will be contributing to it, what your expectations are, and how it is going to roll. Still, on pondering over your presence with me in the sessions, I became a bit doubtful. On the other side, when I had a discussion with Mr. Sagar about your performance, he was very thrilled. May I know what challenges were you facing or do you wish to share anything with me?
28/12/23, 9:36 AM - +91 78891 60553: I am doing very well thank you for asking.
28/12/23, 9:41 AM - +91 78891 60553: Due to the fact that l had to cover up what others had done before l came was kind of a struggle to me. I had assignments, lectures and presentations which needed my attention. On the other hand l had to attend the webinars and sessions and l really tried to balance them but it was bit of a hustle. But as we approach the second semester l think it's going to be better and less of a hustle.

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
