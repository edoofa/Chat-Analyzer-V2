26/12/23, 3:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon parents,
I am so excited to hear about how your Christmas was?

But before anything, this is one of the best appreciations that I have received so far in my career. You know I almost got tears in my eyes when I read this message. I believe with supportive parents like you, our role is half done. Thank you for being with us on this journey, I am sure with your continued support, everything will go well.
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Takunda,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:22 PM - +91 70097 69433: Hello how are you mentor. The update is concerning the project or
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
27/12/23, 4:31 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, it is regarding that
27/12/23, 5:09 PM - +91 70097 69433: great , We had a meeting last time with Mr Rithvik and we told him that the reason is because the results are not yet out .Parents want to first of all see their children's results before allowing them to proceed for application. As they know that they ae some costs that are involved in the process and are afraid of losing the money if the student does not peform as per their expectations.The students will be more serious once the results are out.
28/12/23, 9:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Takunda,
How are you?
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This means that around January end you will be able to talk to more students, right?
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: But before that Takunda, may I know how actively do you work on the community building project?
28/12/23, 11:13 AM - +91 70097 69433: Afternoon how are you doing.
28/12/23, 11:15 AM - +91 70097 69433: Yes as results will be out , students will be serious. Right now they will be just beating around the bush , the results have the final go ahead by the parents.
28/12/23, 11:17 AM - +91 70097 69433: As we had discussed that due to exams pressure and preparation.Work load overally was a bit high , I am working on this project to earn more credits

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me.
