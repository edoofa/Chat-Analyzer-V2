If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 542 9249: I m ready for today's session
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Yes
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

3/1/24, 2:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 542 9249: I am required to reach out to local schools in my local area where I will speak to the decision makers of the local schools to join the edoofa community in which will help them to grow using the experience of edoofa. This improve communication skills and my confidence.
3/1/24, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

5/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Suppose the school whats to contact you which number should l give them
5/1/24, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
5/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Q1 Embakwe High school.No my school is not connected with edoofa
5/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Q2 I will first introduce myself and share with them how I got the scholarship and what my future aspirations are. And I will share details about the program to thr leaders of the schools. And the schedule a call with edoofa
5/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Q3Matebeleland South Province
5/1/24, 3:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
5/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Yes I agree with you
5/1/24, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Ouk..
5/1/24, 3:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
5/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Yes.. I promise
5/1/24, 3:22 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
5/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Yes... With great understanding I have contacted the head of my former school <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 3:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you.
