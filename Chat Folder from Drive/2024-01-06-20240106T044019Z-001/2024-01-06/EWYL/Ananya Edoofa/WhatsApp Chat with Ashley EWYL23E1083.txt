5/1/24, 4:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
