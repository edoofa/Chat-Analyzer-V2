27/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Nyasha,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 4:25 PM - +91 76963 00229: Hey ma'am I hope you are well, I am good. Despite the holiday I was having my birthday 2 days ago and Christmas was also spending with friends. At the same time I'm reading for exams. I'm sorry for the belated Compliments of the new season🥳 pressure got to me
27/12/23, 4:27 PM - +91 76963 00229: Merry Christmas ma'am and a prosperous new year ❤️
28/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Nyasha!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.
