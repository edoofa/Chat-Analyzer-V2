26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adrian!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!

Well, what I have observed today is that if I have not shared a reminder with you before the session, you have clearly missed your session! Don't you think it's a bit irresponsible behavior? Do you get a reminder before your classes at school?

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤

How are you doing today? I've noticed you haven't attended your last two sessions with me. Since you always attend your sessions, I am quite worried. Are you alright?
4/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 376 4957: Good morning...adrian might be facing a challenge with his phone ..no battery...electricity is scarce in zimbabwe..by the time hes online..he would have missed the sessions already..
5/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, @263773764957 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond earlier. That's alright I understand.
