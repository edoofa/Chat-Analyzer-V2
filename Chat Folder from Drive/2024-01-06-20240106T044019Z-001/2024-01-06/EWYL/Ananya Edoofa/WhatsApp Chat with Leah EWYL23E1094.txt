5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Meanwhile, I am sharing a video with you. Wishing you a happy weekend!

I will surely watch the video 
Thank you, wishing you a happy weekend too.
