I hope you all had a wonderful holiday break. Before we dive into today's lesson, I'd love to hear about how your Christmas was. Did you do anything special or have any interesting experiences you'd like to share?
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 9:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting to hear from your end. I had an amazing session planned for you! Why didn't you attend your session? Are you facing any challenges?

5/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
5/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
5/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
5/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Ohh okay noted
