29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kevin,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits as we welcome the New Year. I'd like to take a moment to extend my best wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and rewarding 2024. May it be a year filled with new beginnings, opportunities, and the fulfillment of all your dreams and goals.
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As I was organizing my day today. In reviewing your scholarship application file, I noticed that there's an outstanding payment of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee due by 2nd December 2023. Hence I thought of sharing a gentle reminder about this and checking in to see if you have already made this payment. This will help us to keep your scholarship application file up-to-date and ensure that all is progressing smoothly.
29/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 404 5614: Good day how are you? This is Sheila,  Kevin's mom. May you please allow us to pay this balance on the 5th of January 2024.
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know what challenges were you facing due to which you were unable to clear the remaining balance on time?
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - +263 77 404 5614: My mother was involved in an accident and was hospitalised since mid November. She is getting better now so l couldn't afford to pay the balance that time. I am sorry that l didn't inform you. The pressure was just too much for me l am so sorry
29/12/23, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774045614I'm truly sorry to hear about your mother's accident and her hospitalization since mid-November. It's completely understandable that under such circumstances, managing financial commitments, including the payment balance, could be challenging. May I know what happened?
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 77 404 5614: She is a mental patient so she left home without informing anyone... We never heard from her the whole day...only to find out that she was admitted at Annex Hospital the following day from  a nurse who had posted looking for her relatives
29/12/23, 8:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm deeply sorry to hear about the challenging situation with your mother. It must have been incredibly distressing not to hear from her for an entire day, especially given her mental health condition. Discovering that she was admitted to Annex Hospital in such circumstances must have brought a mix of relief and concern.

It's a difficult experience for any family to go through, and it's important during these times to have support and understanding from those around you. I hope that now that she's been located and is under care, things are a bit more manageable for you and your family?
29/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 77 404 5614: Yes she much better now despite the fact that two of her ribs got broken when she was hit by the car. She is recovering at home now.
29/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 77 404 5614: *From home*
29/12/23, 10:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that she is getting better now, I can understand how hard it must be for you to watch your mother go through all of this. I am sure she will recover soon. I want to extend my wishes to you and your family. As we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐

2/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kevin.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful New Year celebration. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, so may I know if we are still in communication?
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
