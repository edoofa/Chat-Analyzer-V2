I hope you are doing well. It has been a long time today, how are you doing today?
4/1/24, 7:39 PM - +265 997 17 19 93: I'm so good
4/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, how is your preparation going on since your deadline is now near, have you been able to raise the remaining amount?
5/1/24, 10:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I had anticipated hearing back from you, but I understand that you might have been unable to respond. Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.
