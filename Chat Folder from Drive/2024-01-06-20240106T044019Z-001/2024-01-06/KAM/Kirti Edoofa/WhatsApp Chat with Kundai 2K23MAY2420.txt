I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
5/1/24, 10:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting today as I was occupied with a meeting. Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.
