26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 3:30 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Good Day Ma'am.
Sorry for the late response, we have been having network challenges but am ready for the discussion!
26/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Before we start our session for today, May I know if you remember the benefits shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
26/12/23, 3:42 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Benefits of Edoofa Scholarship Program?
26/12/23, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These one dear, May I know if you remember them?
26/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes l remember them!
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me continue from there in that case.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 4:40 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Crystal clear!
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 4:57 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Understood
26/12/23, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 71 359 5826: No ma'am
26/12/23, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am!
