2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you have financial concern, however I am curious to understand why you want to take this decision now as you are not aware of the cost of education for Hilda yet, right?
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 409 1814: We failed to meet the deadline of paying the 150 and can we be given a longer payment plan and from the conversation we discovered that more payments were needed
