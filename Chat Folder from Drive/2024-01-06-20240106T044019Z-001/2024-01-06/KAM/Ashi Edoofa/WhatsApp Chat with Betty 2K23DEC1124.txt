26/12/23, 7:58 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Qn2

Memory is used to store data and programs at the time of processing on the computer. Main use is saving and retrieving data.

A. Primary/main memory is the internal memory of the computer which holds data and instructions currently working on the systems/CPU. Its volatile memory, because when power is switched off it loses all data.

EXAMPLES
1. Random Access Memory is a read /writes memory. Information stored in RAM is lost whenever the power supply to the computer is switched off.

Types of RAM 

i. Static RAM stores information as long as the power supply is ON. SRAM are of higher cost, consume more power and higher speed than DRAM

ii. Dynamic RAM stores information in a very short time. Its cheaper ,moderate speed and consumes less power.

2. Read Only Memory is a permanent memory where  information is not lost when power supply is switched off. The Content of ROM is inserted by the computer manufacturer and permanently stored at the time of manufacturing. ROM cannot be overwritten by the computer, thus Non- Volatile Memory.

Types of ROM memory

i. Programmable Read Only Memory writes data once and read many, recorded information cannot be changed, thus non-volatile.

ii. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory chip is programmed by erasing the information stored earlier and then exposing the chip to  ultraviolet light.

iii. Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory is programmed and erased by special electrical waves in milliseconds.

3. Cache memory is  high-speed memory for frequently used instructions and data compensating speed difference of main memory access time and processor logic.

B. Secondary/auxiliary memory is an external memory storing different program permanently. Data is stored permanently even if power is switched off,hence nonvolatile

Hard Disk
• The hard disk drive is the main, and usually largest,
data storage device in a computer storing from 160Gb to 2Tb.Hard disk speed is that at which content can
be read and written on a hard disk.

Other examples are floppy Disks,Magnetic Tapes, Pen Drive, Winchester Disk, Optical Disk.
26/12/23, 7:58 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Qn3 Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)model

Application layer is for end user software like web browsers. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP, DNS allows sending, receiving and presenting meaningful data to users. 

 Presentation Layer defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end.

 Session Layer opens sessions, ensures functionality during transfer, and closes when connection ends.It sets checkpoints during a data transfer,if session is interrupted, data transfer resume from the last checkpoint.

Transport Layer reassembles segments on the receiving end. It makes sure data is sent at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device and checks if data was received correct.

Network layer breaks segments into packets, and reassembles them on the receiving end. It routes packets across a network using IP addresses.

Data link layer establishes and terminates connections. LLC identifies network protocols, performs error checking, synchronizes frames, and uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions.

Physical layer transmitts raw data, a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.
26/12/23, 7:59 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Qn4 Operator Overloading

When you call an overloaded function or operator, the compiler determines the most appropriate definition to use by comparing the argument types you used to call the function or operator with the parameter types specified in the definitions.

Overloaded operators are functions with special names the keyword operator followed by the symbol for the operator being defined. Like any other function, an overloaded operator has a return type and a parameter list. For example,Box operator+(const Box&);
declares the addition operator that can be used to add two Box objects and returns final Box object. Most overloaded operators may be defined as ordinary non-member functions or as class member functions. In case we define above function as non-member function of a class then we would have to pass two arguments for each operand.

Polymorphism (or operator overloading) is a manner in which OO systems allow the same operator name or symbol to be used for multiple operations.Following is the list of operators that can be overloaded: Unary Arithmetic Operators such as: +, -, ++, - Binary Arithmetic Operators such as: +, -, *, /, % Assignment Operators such as: =, +=, *=, /=, -=, %=
26/12/23, 8:00 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Qn5 Technology and Economic growth 

Technological revolution promotes economic development as it improves efficiency and productivity, promotes competition and innovation, and provides employment opportunities.  Technological change contributes to alleviating poverty and other social problems.Although there is no one-to-one relationship between technological change and economic development, the association is essential.
Technology affect growth by increasing productivity and expanding markets for goods and services hence, greater food security

Reducing poverty is  primary goal in developing countries, particularly those poor or emerging from conflict situations. New technologies have helped spread information about opportunities for jobs or education in other parts of the country or world. This helps people access the information, increasing their chances of becoming part of the formal economy and helping them improve their living.
Technological advancement in agriculture allows farmers to grow more crops with fewer resources. For example, satellite imagery can help farmers plan their activities more effectively to be more efficient with their available resources; this leads to higher yields per acre for a given amount of land thus benefiting from technological innovation.This has led researchers to develop better fertilizers and pesticides that help crops grow faster and produce more food for consumers.

Technology is affecting economic development in Africa, which is why we should stay up-to-date with the technological advancement.
26/12/23, 8:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Betty, I hope you are doing well.
26/12/23, 8:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us
26/12/23, 8:03 AM - +263 71 617 1945: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 8:03 AM - +263 71 617 1945: We are doing well thanks for asking
26/12/23, 8:03 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Its okay, would have sent them earlier but was facing some technical difficulties
26/12/23, 8:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263716171945
26/12/23, 8:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you would like to continue with the session now or at our scheduled time?
26/12/23, 8:12 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes 2pm is ok
26/12/23, 8:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263716171945
26/12/23, 8:19 AM - +263 71 617 1945: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 8:20 AM - +263 71 617 1945: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms Ananya_ and she has scheduled my session for _29 Dec 2023_*
26/12/23, 8:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
26/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 71 617 1945: Thank you
26/12/23, 8:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263716171945
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Greetings
26/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Betty, May I know if we can start our today's session?
26/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes we can
26/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 77 522 2749: We may start
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes it is
26/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/12/23, 3:11 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yeah true
26/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 352 8011: Yes its impossible
26/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 352 8011: I think I will need your help in choosing the best institution there
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - +263 71 617 1945: That's correct
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/12/23, 3:51 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
26/12/23, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
26/12/23, 4:01 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes understood
26/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
26/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Ok noted
26/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/12/23, 4:30 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Ok
26/12/23, 4:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 352 8011: So far no questions
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:55 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Sounds interesting
26/12/23, 4:55 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Oooh wooow
26/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Awesome news
26/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Oooh really
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Conditions are conducive
26/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263716171945 Shall we continue?
26/12/23, 5:13 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 5:19 PM - +263 71 617 1945: So Advantageous
26/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 5:28 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 5:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
26/12/23, 5:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 5:37 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Understood
26/12/23, 5:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 5:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 5:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 5:48 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Its very clear
26/12/23, 5:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Please elaborate on that one
26/12/23, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 5:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 5:52 PM - +263 71 617 1945: I loved the re-Evaluation part
26/12/23, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263716171945. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 5:54 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 5:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes but what will happen to the amount of money they would have paid to Edoofa
26/12/23, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Your doubt will be cleared soon dear, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Okay
26/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 5:58 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
26/12/23, 5:59 PM - +263 71 617 1945: Atleast
26/12/23, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*
