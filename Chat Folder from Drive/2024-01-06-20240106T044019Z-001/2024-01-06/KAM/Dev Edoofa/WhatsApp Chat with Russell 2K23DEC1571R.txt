26/12/23, 1:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

26/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I was inspired by the Edoofa vision of offering accessible and affordable education for all, the EWYL program which offers students a chance to reduce their tuition fees and gain valuable job skills 
And finally  the dedication which is manifested in the Edoofa student care team to guide their students in the path  which leads to success
26/12/23, 1:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Earn while you Learn program provides the opportunity to the hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.

This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are pre-requisites before venturing into any field and climb the ladder of success.

26/12/23, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing. In addition to these forms, we kindly request the following documents for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Travelling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
26/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 399 6403: By   April in 2024  when schools will close
26/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 399 6403: But immediately when  the schools open l should request for the document to be produced
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am having a little problem understanding this, may I please know that if you will be able to provide the letter of recommendation by April 2024 or the A-level results by  April 2024?
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I mean the letter of recommendation
The A level results will be released in  February 2025
26/12/23, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know and I have taken a note of it.
But April is five months away and other students are able to get their Letter of Recommendation within a single day, so please let me know, if you are facing any issue or have a particular reason for the delay?
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - +263 71 399 6403: The challenge  is on how to send the letter to you since cellphones are not allowed at school
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 399 6403: What l can do is to send the letter to my mother from a school teacher's cellphone so that she can forward it to you
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: You may get it printed from the school itself. It would not require you to use cellphone.
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: This is also a viable option to consider.
Whichever you are comfortable with.
26/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Okay that is  a better plan, so then I will have to send it to mom from school right
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Russell, if you are comfortable with it.
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 399 6403: It is l have no problem with  it
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
26/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 399 6403: From 1230 to 1330
26/12/23, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session and as for the academic documents, you need to provide it by this Friday, i.e., 29th December.

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Yes sir l am following

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group.
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 71 399 6403: However I can only produce the O level results since l have not yet written  my Alevel examination
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: yes, surely.
For A-level results, you can provide the letter of recommendation instead, which is readily provided by the school. <This message was edited>

27/12/23, 5:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing fine as well. Thank you for asking.
Shall we start with our session?
27/12/23, 5:52 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes
27/12/23, 5:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Constance's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes  we may start
27/12/23, 5:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Alright sir
27/12/23, 5:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 5:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 78 308 6466: They are  crystal clear
27/12/23, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 6:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 308 6466: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 308 6466: Yes l am following
27/12/23, 6:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 6:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 78 308 6466: They are crystal clear
27/12/23, 6:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

What understood  from the videos  is  the  vision that Edoofa  has to offer  affordable  and accessible  education  for all ,moreover  the need for scholarship  applicants  to be open  and follow  instruction , and how important  the Statement of Purpose is  for  a scholarship  applicant to prove they are  elligible for a scholarship    and to boost their scholarship percentage
28/12/23, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
