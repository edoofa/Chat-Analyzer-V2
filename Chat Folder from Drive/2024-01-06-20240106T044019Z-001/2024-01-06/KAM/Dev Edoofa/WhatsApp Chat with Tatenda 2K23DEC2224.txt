For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk lm done
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes lm following
5/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yaaa lm clear
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir lm ready
5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tatenda, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
5/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 704 1765: I'm able to go through starting now
5/1/24, 1:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!

5/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 704 1765: To summarie this whole thing up in the first video l caught that one of the co founders went to Africa and saw people who are open minded and are ready to shoot themselves towards success and that's a good thing to note about my very own Africa. On the other  hand there are people who always blame the situation and don't go towards success.From the story of the 8th grader l learnt to always boost my confidence and aim for higher things in life.On the second video l noticed that due to Edoofas experience which is more than 10 years they are capable of helping you find better employment after tertiary level.I also heard about different types of students from the story of a cup and a tank in the ocean.l was also informed about some of the Edofians like Courage.On video 3 were they explained the step 5.They highlighted about some agencies who do scholarships for money and sent students to poor universities.l was also thrilled from the fact that most of the Edofians pass with flying colours in their tertiary education.The Edoofa community provides students with varies skills that help shape the society.On the last video they talked about the SOP.                

In a nut shell l would like to say that the Edoofa team prepares you physically, mentally and they help you have a better vision..  From these videos l learnt to always listen to the directors
5/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 704 1765: So when will l catch the next discussion
