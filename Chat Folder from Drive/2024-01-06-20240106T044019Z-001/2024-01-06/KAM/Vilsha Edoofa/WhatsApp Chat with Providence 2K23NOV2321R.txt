I am Ms. Vilsha, I am the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past few days due to our unavailability during the Christmas period.
26/12/23, 12:21 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: We hope you had a joyous and blessed Christmas celebration filled with warmth, festivities, and quality time with your loved ones.
26/12/23, 12:22 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: How are you doing today? It has indeed been a few days since we last connected with each other, and we are eager to catch up with you and help you navigate the next steps.

27/12/23, 12:24 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Afternoon ma'am
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - +263 78 582 3356: May you excuse me ma'am, my network is not performing well due to the weather today
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Providence,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope that the network challenges you were experiencing yesterday have been resolved by now. Yesterday, I was engaged in a series of meetings, which unfortunately kept me from connecting with you.
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: On a positive note, during one of these meetings, I received an update from the accounts team regarding the payment you made for your enrollment fee and the balance you have for the remaining part of your fee. 

I am delighted to inform you that the accounts team has successfully confirmed the payment and has shared the payment receipt with us. Please find the payment receipt detailed below:
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the receipt for your reference. Once you have confirmed the details, we can not only discuss the preparations you have made for the remaining part of the fee but also move forward with your next steps. 

Rest assured, I will guide you through the procedures for the 2025 academic intake, ensuring a smooth transition into the next phase of your academic journey.
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 78 582 3356: The weather is unfavourable here ma'am.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Providence and I hope you were also able to taken a note of the payment receipt that I shared with you for the first part of your Edoofa Enrollment Fee. 

As I was organizing my schedule and reviewing your application file, I noticed that the due date for your remaining Edoofa enrollment fee of $150 is on December 30, 2023, Saturday. This encouraged me to connect with you and inquire about your progress. Have you been able to raise the entire amount and make the deposit for your fee? 

I am keen to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly on your end.
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Let me inform my parents about the receipt then I will tell you their respond
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Providence, that would be fine as well. May I know when can I expect a response from your end for the remaining part of your enrollment fee so that I can update the academic board and the accounts team accordingly?
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Tomorrow at 12:00
28/12/23, 3:05 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay, Providence. I have taken note of the same update and we will connect with each other for the same accordingly. In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA Geography nd it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 12:01 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Afternoon ma'am
29/12/23, 12:01 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Yes it's accurate
29/12/23, 12:02 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Sorry for not communicating
29/12/23, 12:03 PM - +263 78 582 3356: The remaining part of the enrollment fee is going to be paid today ma'am
29/12/23, 12:19 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Providence,

I hope you are doing well, and I find you in the best of spirits. It is alright if you were not able to connect with us yesterday. I can understand that you must have a genuine reason, and hence that is okay.
29/12/23, 12:19 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, thank you for sharing the update on the payment of your remaining part of the enrollment fee. As you always do, once you have made the payment of your fee, please ensure to share the payment receipt with us so that we can get the payment confirmed by the accounts team and update the academic board as well.
29/12/23, 12:19 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, if you are available, I would like to inquire if we can move forward with our discussion regarding your next steps?
29/12/23, 12:26 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Okay
29/12/23, 12:26 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Yes we can move forward .
29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 78 757 9217: Yes
29/12/23, 3:44 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Let me help you here @263787579217. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - +263 78 757 9217: Ok
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 78 757 9217: Yes it is
29/12/23, 3:52 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Yes of course
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
29/12/23, 4:03 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Yes that's true
29/12/23, 4:08 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
29/12/23, 4:08 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
29/12/23, 4:08 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
29/12/23, 4:12 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Noted
29/12/23, 4:16 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Yeah
29/12/23, 4:19 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/12/23, 9:40 AM - +263 78 582 3356: Yes

5/1/24, 1:28 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents, and Providence,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. We extend my sincere apologies for the delayed response, as the long weekend coincided with the festive season here in India. During this time, our team was briefly unavailable, resulting in a delay in attending to your messages.

5/1/24, 1:33 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Additionally, I wanted to acknowledge that we have received the payment receipt you shared for the remaining enrollment fee. It has been duly updated in our records and confirmed by the accounts team. To ensure transparency, we encourage you to review the attached receipt provided below.

Once you've had the chance to review the receipt, please inform us of any clarifications or if everything is in order so that we can move forward with our ongoing discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan.
