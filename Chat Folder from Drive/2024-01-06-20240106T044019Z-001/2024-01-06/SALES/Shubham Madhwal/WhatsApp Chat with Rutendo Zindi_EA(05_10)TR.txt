05/10/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: Noted
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - Tushti: May I know what subjects you have chosen at A Level?
05/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Mathematics,Biology and Chemistry
05/10/23, 1:03 pm - Tushti: So, have you done any research about the subject requirements to study medicine in India?
05/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 983 5249: No,l want to know
05/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: Rutendo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
05/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: Now you must choose the course that aligns with your vision and goals from the list above
05/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Okay
05/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Bachelor of science in Optometry
05/10/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: May I know why you chose this course? <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Because l want to develop good relationship with patients that have poor vision and so make spectacles affordable to anyone.Its also good job when looking at the income you can earn.l have a passion to do this job regardless of the earnings but l just wish that later on in future l help the old age and young that have poor vision but cannot afford to buy the spectacles
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Tushti: Amazing
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the course
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Okay please do
05/10/23, 1:21 pm - Tushti: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
05/10/23, 1:21 pm - Tushti: Let me know if you have understood the course
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 983 5249: I love this👏💯
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 983 5249: I understand it well
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
05/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Okay wait
05/10/23, 1:27 pm - Tushti: Sure
05/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 983 5249: In 5 years to come l see myself as an optometrist  serving people in my area.l would also love to open my own clinic which is specifically for that.l want to make sure that people in rural areas can access my clinic so l have to build some there so that everyone is helped.The Edoofa's program will help me get quality education in India  and my finances will be lower too.l will also get to associate with different people getting different ideas from those people in India and it will help me grow into being a very good social person.
05/10/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: That is really great Rutendo, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 983 5249: Yes l am willing
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?

05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 983 5249: I am willing to pursue my goal in India
05/10/23, 4:23 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow  at 9:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 983 5249: My cousin was enrolled recently by the Edoofa program so we are a little bit familiar with the costs
05/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 351 0261: Hello Ms Tushti , I'm Ms  Kanyenze  Rutendo's mum its a pleasure to be associated with you
05/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 351 0261: Sorry I was at work so I could not  reply your messages
06/10/23, 9:05 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
06/10/23, 9:05 am - Tushti: That's great, let me brief you a little more on the same
06/10/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: Now,  let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/10/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/10/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/10/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 9:30 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/10/23, 9:31 am - Tushti: In simple words Rutendo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/10/23, 12:52 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

The 1994 genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda left about 1 million people dead in a period of only three months.The Tutsi used the institutions of the state to transform the fear and hate into the myriad acts of hunting,raping and killing that made up the genocide.Leaders of the Hutu had to be able to give orders and see them executed by controlling the millitary,the administration and political parties.Tutsi had greater wealth than the Hutu making them responsible for the continuity of poverty to the Hutu.

After 16 years of this genocide it has been noticed than most of the people were psychologically affected.About 75% of the Tutsi were killed and most people were left orphaned and widowed.In the direct aftermath of the genocide,2 million to refuge in the neighbouring countries.Some who were prisoners were released and the partakers of the war started living next door to each other.Mental health issues were noticed in widows,orphans and children in child headed families as they were very depressed and very anxious due to the genocide that occured.People were also affected physically i.e they were left physically disabled.

To deal with all the trauma they incurred people were now involved in the consumption of alcohol and there were also some cases of suicidality.It was discovered that some people in Rwanda suffered from PTSD.Due to death,parental protection was often lacking in children also.As remarriage is socially not tolerated widows having difficulties taking care if their families in an appropriate way especially when they are not further integrated in the community. Prisoners that were released took part in government confession program that reduced sentence  for perpetrators who admitted guilt and remorse.

All in all people suffered from trauma,mental and physical health problems.

SECTION 6
PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"

There once had a girl called Styler.She lived in a small village with both her parents and her four brothers.

Styler's parents were not that rich at all,the only thing they had as a herd of cows that were about 15 and a small farm.They used to work very hard to earn a living.

In the community Styler was always mocked by all the boys in her area because she was not good looking.Styler had a face of a boy and people used to make fun of it.This made Styler feel bad and she had no friends to play with.

Regardless of all that,Styler was very intelligent and she performed very well in her studies.Her parents were soo proud of her and they thought of sending their daughter to a better school but they could not afford those boarding schools.To solve that they took one of their cattle and they sold it.They used all the money to send their daughter to a boardinf school and buy her uniforms.

Although Styler was at a boarding school she could not afford all the food reqirements needed.Hence,all that her  parents could do was popping their maize and pack it for her so that she could also chew something when other children are eating in their dometries.

After she wrote her exams she was one of the outstanding students at her school regardless of what people used to say about her she focused on herself and she finished her school with the mist beautiful results.

Styler got a scholarship and went to study abroad and finished her studies well and got her PhD in Mathematics. 

After a month Styler got a proposal from one of the doctor there in Turkey and they asked her for a hand in marriage.This made her cry so much because she thought that no guy would want a person like her but now she was better than those made fun of her.

Styler then returned to a country so she can do her wedding ritual and everything went well.Before she went back she bought her parents a new house at a new place and also left them a lot of money to use for the meantime.

18/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 983 5249: Mr Shubham since l get my Alevel results on August next it means l will be starting my program in September not August is it?

18/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 351 0261: Yes she will be appearing for the exams in 2024 but June exams
18/10/23, 10:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: So your intake will begin in the month of August-2025 in that case Rutendo
18/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 983 5249: My results will be out by August and l thought it was a September intake from my own understanding
18/10/23, 10:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: Rutendo, you will be elgible for both the September intake of 2024 and August 2025, 
The reason is, that sometimes the ZIMSEC as you are aware delays the declaration of results, So we have to keep that in consideration as well
18/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 983 5249: I'm doing Cambridge not Zimsec
18/10/23, 10:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Rutendo, 
What I meant to say was you were eligible for both the intakes
18/10/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 983 5249: Okay l understand
18/10/23, 10:37 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in your acceptance letter?
18/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 983 5249: 24 October
18/10/23, 10:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, Ask your parents to participate as well
18/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 351 0261: And we had opted for the other one where by we will pay $200in October  first and the remaining balance in November
18/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 983 5249: Okay
18/10/23, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: And are you aware of the transaction charges as well?
18/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 983 5249: 12.5%
18/10/23, 11:06 am - Shubham Madhwal: And are you and your parents aware of the Transaction Methods as well?
18/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 983 5249: Yes we are from what is written in the acceptance letter
18/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 983 5249: So Mr Shorwi is the one who takes all the transactions
18/10/23, 11:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
18/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 351 0261: I think the second one would be more convenient , using the associates account
18/10/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
18/10/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

I personally have been helping students for the last 4 and a half years, and when I say that, with a little bit of my own experience, I personally feel there is actually something else which is the real concern over here!

Why don't you honestly share the real query with me, because there is surely something else which is a matter of concern right now? 

Don't be hesitant to share what is going on, because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going on in your mind without you even sharing it with me.

27/10/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please, India is known for its diverse culinary culture. hence the use of spices, herbs, and various cooking techniques. A typical Indian meal often includes rice or bread (roti), accompanied by a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Unlike Zimbabwean cuisine, Indian food features a wide range of flavours, from spicy to sweet, and offers a plethora of options for both vegetarians and meat lovers. The prevalence of lentils and the use of yoghurt and ghee in cooking can also be highlighted. It's a blend of flavours and traditions that reflect India's cultural diversity.
27/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
