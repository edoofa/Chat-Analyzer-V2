21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So why did you not opt for Physics in yoour A-level?
21/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Biology is my favorite subject sir ..I just like everything about the animal cell and anatomy so I guess thats why I chose Biology over physics
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Michael, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
21/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Not really but I would really love to know the requirements
21/12/23, 3:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 284 6336: So one cant do medicine without physics 🙂

03/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 78 284 6336: No
03/01/24, 10:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's amazing, can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
03/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 284 6336: I imagine that five years after my training, I would be working in a busy hospital or lab, conducting important tests and helping to save lives. I would hope to be an expert in my field, and to have gained a reputation for accuracy and efficiency. And if I had the opportunity to be helped by Edoofa, I believe it would give me the skills and knowledge I need to succeed. I would be able to access the latest technology and research, and to learn from experienced and knowledgeable instructors. Ultimately, I believe that Edoofa's program would enable me to reach my full potential
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
03/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Am willing to do all what it takes sir
03/01/24, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Yes I am 💯
03/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
03/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Yeah why and why India only why not to other countries
03/01/24, 1:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.
03/01/24, 1:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* Studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions worldwide. The cost of education is lower, and various scholarships, loans, and financial assistance programs are available to support students.

03/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Alright I have read through all what you have sent me and I now know why edoofa recommend India for higher education.I also wanted to know who will chose the university that a student who got the scholarship will go ?
03/01/24, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, You will be choosing the same!
03/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Okay great we can proceed
03/01/24, 1:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
03/01/24, 1:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
03/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Of course! I have many reasons for wanting to study abroad, rather than in my home country. One of the main reasons is that I want to experience new cultures and ways of thinking. I believe that by studying in a different country, I will be able to broaden my horizons and gain a new perspective on the world. I also want to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone. Studying abroad will allow me to do that, while also gaining valuable skills and knowledge. And finally, I'm just excited to explore new places and meet new people!
03/01/24, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
03/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 284 6336: No I haven't, and also haven't researched on foreign education
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please!
03/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Okay
03/01/24, 3:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
03/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 284 6336: No I don't
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Noted sir .. now I understand
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Oh that's great news
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now further brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Yes you can
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
03/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Got it sir it's a good program
03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

03/01/24, 4:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
03/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 284 6336: It's indeed something I ever dreamed of
03/01/24, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
03/01/24, 4:46 pm - +263 78 284 6336: It seems I finished the 1st step and this is the 2nd step we're in .If I manage to pass this test then I will be accepted into the program, then I will be enrolled in the Edoofa
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
03/01/24, 5:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/01/24, 6:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
04/01/24, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
04/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 78 284 6336: As a student looking to study abroad, affordability is a huge concern. The Edoofa program is a game-changer in this respect, as it guarantees scholarships for every accepted student. This means that no matter what your financial situation is, you can be assured of getting a significant scholarship on your tuition fee. Additionally, the program waives off all application fees, saving you even more money. This is a great deal, as it takes away much of the financial stress associated with studying abroad. With Edoofa, you can focus on your studies and enjoy your time abroad without worrying about money.
04/01/24, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
04/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 284 6336: Yes you did sir
04/01/24, 11:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
04/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 284 6336: Oh okay I get it
04/01/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
04/01/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
04/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 284 6336: So if you fail to pay within a week , what will happen
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: There is a reason that we have provided this 7 day period, which is that the number of applicants for the scholarship is more than 1000 on a daily basis and the number of seats is limited, So if In case the student when selected after the interview fails to provide the enrollment fees on time, Then there will be no extension as it will block a seat for some another student, We are the leading scholarship providing organization to Meritorious students of Africa and we do not want that the deserving students miss on this opportunity, I hope you understand!
04/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 284 6336: Yes I do understand
04/01/24, 11:46 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
04/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 284 6336: No sir
04/01/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
04/01/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
04/01/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
04/01/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
04/01/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 284 6336: It sounds clear
04/01/24, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
