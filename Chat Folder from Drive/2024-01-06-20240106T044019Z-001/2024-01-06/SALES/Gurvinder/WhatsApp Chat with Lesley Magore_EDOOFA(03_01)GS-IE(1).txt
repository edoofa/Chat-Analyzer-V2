04/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
04/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

04/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 932 5800: Yes
04/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 932 5800: Five years later after completing a degree from an Indian University, l see myself working in the technology industry in India. I would have gained valuable experience and knowledge during my studies which would make me a competitive candidate for jobs in this field. Being part of the Edoofa program would have helped me to achieve my dreams by providing me with a world class education, exposure to new cultures and the opportunity to build a strong professional network
04/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lesley I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 932 5800: Yes am willing
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 932 5800: First am interested in experiencing different culture and learning about a new way of life. Studying abroad will give me the opportunity to immerse myself in a new environment and broaden my horizons. Another reason is l want to improve my English language skills and finally studying abroad will give me a competitive edge when it comes to my future career. Employers value international experience and having that on my resume will make me stand out
04/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 932 5800: First l plan to share my knowledge and experience with other students who are interested in studying abroad and second l plan to use my learnings to improve the quality of education in my country. I believe that there is a lot that can be learned from education system in other countries and l want to bring those best practice back to my country
04/01/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lesley, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 932 5800: Yes l agree
04/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 932 5800: Yes it is
04/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
