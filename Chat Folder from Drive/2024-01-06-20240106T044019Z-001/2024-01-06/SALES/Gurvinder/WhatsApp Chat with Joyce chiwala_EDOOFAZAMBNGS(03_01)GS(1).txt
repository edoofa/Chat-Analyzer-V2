Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
03/01/24, 10:36 am - +260 97 0250663: To my own understanding 
I understood that Edoofa Scholarship program is a program that helps educate people with high education for them to have good employment and also helps people who can’t afford or have problems with affordability. But for one to get the scholarship one needs to also have good grades
03/01/24, 10:37 am - +260 97 0250663: Am kindly asking if you could add

03/01/24, 1:13 pm - +260 776008962: Good Afternoon, My Name is Mary Chiwala from Zambia.I am Joyce's elder sister. I will be representing our mother in this reason being she traveled to the rural area and  with poor network.
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Ms Chiwala.
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: Should I brief you more about the program?
03/01/24, 1:19 pm - +260 776008962: Yes please
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 1:34 pm - +260 97 0250663: Yes indeed, I really want to remove the burden on my mother.
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Joyce, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 776008962: This is impressive. We're honored to be part of the program. May we proceed please.
03/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 0250663: Yes I do
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 97 0250663: Sure thing
03/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Now Joyce, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

Don’t you agree?
04/01/24, 2:14 pm - +260 97 0250663: Yes I do .
04/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - +260 97 0250663: This message was deleted
04/01/24, 2:19 pm - +260 97 0250663: Yes,I have been wondering and I would like to know how that became possible.

04/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 0250663: Interesting, India is really an ambitious and determined country impressive.
04/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now Joyce, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/01/24, 2:49 pm - +260 97 0250663: Do students learn on public holidays?
04/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Please, everyone gets a public holiday.
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - +260 97 0250663: Alright.
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - +260 97 0250663: No, would you sure please.
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - +260 776008962: No
Please brief us so that we know what we have to deal with.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 0250663: So despite one getting a scholarship they have to pay some fee? If yes, then how long?
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I told you before that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: This cost of Education is per year for the duration of your education.
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - +260 97 0250663: Understood
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - +260 776008962: Oh okay understood now.Thank you so much for the information. We hope for the best
04/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 97 0250663: Yes please.

04/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Joyce, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in. <This message was edited>

04/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

04/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs

04/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

04/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 97 0250663: I definitely think this will benefit and I will also turn any situation into an opportunity
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 9:51 am - +260 97 0250663: Good morning. 
I am so ready with day’s journey.
05/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Joyce, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 97 0250663: Alright well understood.
05/01/24, 11:15 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 11:16 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/01/24, 11:26 am - +260 97 0250663: That is exactly what I have been for, am so inspired on how students are able to now pay for their own education, I would also want to do the same.
05/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright Joyce, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/01/24, 11:59 am - +260 97 0250663: Yes they will.
05/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/01/24, 12:17 pm - +260 97 0250663: This is what we are talking about right now since my mother is now back.
05/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 97 0250663: Sorry for inconveniencing you, my Mother has refused me to go study outside the country because of some reasons.
05/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the concern?
05/01/24, 1:08 pm - +260 97 0250663: She is looking at some challenges that she can face while am there for example what if I get sick and she is really needed or where there is an out break off a disease like Covid-19, were is she going to find the money in such short notices like that.
05/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Please, we have a special department of student welfare that regularly visits the Universities to solve any concern that students are facing, moreover events like COVID-19 are once in a decade and India has a great and affordable healthcare system,even if something like that occurs again.
