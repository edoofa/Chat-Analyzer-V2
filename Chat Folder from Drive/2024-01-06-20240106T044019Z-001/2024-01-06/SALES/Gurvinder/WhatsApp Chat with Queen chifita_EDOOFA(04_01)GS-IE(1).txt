04/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Queen, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
04/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

04/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you the course?
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes you can
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

05/01/24, 9:46 am - +260 96 0825221: Morning
05/01/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Queen I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/01/24, 10:24 am - +260 96 0825221: Yes I am willing
05/01/24, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/01/24, 11:14 am - +260 96 0825221: I want to study abroad because i know that I will get good education concerning on health care issues.
Not only that studying abroad has always be my dream
05/01/24, 11:17 am - +260 96 0825221: I also feel like I will get a good experience in dealing with health issues
05/01/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/01/24, 12:08 pm - +260 96 0825221: By encouraging the youth, to pursue there education at a high institution, which will help them get exposure,and a high education will also help them boost their teamwork leadership and communication skills.
Not only that but it can also help them develop a better understanding of how business is conducted in different cultures, leadership skill and it can also help the youth to become more opened minded
05/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Queen, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/01/24, 12:28 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes I agree
05/01/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/01/24, 12:57 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
05/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

05/01/24, 1:06 pm - +260 96 0825221: These is really nice
05/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now Queen, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/01/24, 1:10 pm - +260 96 0825221: No thanks
05/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/01/24, 1:15 pm - +260 96 0825221: No we are not
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 1:28 pm - +260 96 0825221: It’s very expensive without scholarships
05/01/24, 1:28 pm - +260 96 0825221: Noted
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Queen, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/01/24, 1:36 pm - +260 96 0825221: Okay
05/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

05/01/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Queen, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 96 0825221: Okay
05/01/24, 1:54 pm - +260 96 0825221: Thanks for the explanation
05/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/01/24, 2:04 pm - +260 96 0825221: These is amazing
05/01/24, 2:04 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Queen, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/01/24, 2:16 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yeah I did but the want me to get a scholarship so that it can be easy in terms of financiers
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Queen as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 2:38 pm - +260 96 0825221: The student will spend $1500-$2250
05/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Queen, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - +260 96 0825221: Okay
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
05/01/24, 2:50 pm - +260 96 0825221: Noted
05/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/01/24, 2:52 pm - +260 96 0825221: No
05/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Queen, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - +260 96 0825221: Yes I do
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/01/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/01/24, 2:59 pm - +260 96 0825221: In short you are saying that when I get accepted I need to pay for registration fee that’s $350
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, the enrollment fee offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
05/01/24, 3:03 pm - +260 96 0825221: So when I pay for the registration fee that’s $350 will I  also pay for my school fee
05/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please, did I not share this with you?
05/01/24, 3:04 pm - +260 96 0825221: Okay
05/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
