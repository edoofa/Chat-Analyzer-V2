13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

13/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: Noted
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 289 5751: yes l am 100% confident
13/12/23, 4:10 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
13/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 289 5751: not quite
13/12/23, 5:59 pm - Arshita: My office hours are over here, Let us connect at *08:30 AM CAT (14/12/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameter of evaluation.

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
