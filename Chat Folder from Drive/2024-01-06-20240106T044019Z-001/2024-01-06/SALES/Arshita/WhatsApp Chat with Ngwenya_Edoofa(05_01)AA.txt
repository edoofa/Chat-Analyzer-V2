05/01/24, 4:06 pm - Arshita: Ngwenya, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Mbalenhle?*
05/01/24, 4:07 pm - +27 84 796 4509: I'm fine thanks and how are you
05/01/24, 4:23 pm - +27 84 796 4509: To answer the first question,
I have always dreamed of studying abroad since I was in primary and unfortunately I was staying at rural areas where we don't access to internet and even cellphones.
So when I grew I got access to a cellphone and I saw adverts on this scholarship and I saw that as a good opportunity for me since I had no one who was going to pay for my university fees to add more the Earn While You Learn program motivated me the most because it makes my learning a bit easier. So I would simple say I saw Edoofa scholarship as a dream come true
05/01/24, 4:26 pm - Arshita: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, *Midlands Province(Fletcher, Regina Mundi, etc). Mathebeland(North, South) we have St Mark’s, Usher High, Plumtree, Sizane High etc.* Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Mrs. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA)* who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabweans who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
05/01/24, 5:07 pm - Arshita: Are we still connected?
05/01/24, 5:08 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Then to answer the second question .

I understood that Edoofa is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions Pvt .Ltd in India , on my discussion with Mbalenhle I understood that Edoofa scholarship solves the problems of lack of affordability and employability in higher education or the tetiary level.

She even told me about the Earn While You Learn program that is a unique work- study which is going to help me pay for my fees if I get the opportunity to be an Edoofian .
Moreso Edoofa is working closely with Zimbabwe and has got 2500+ students enrolled in the program. I also understood that Edoofa stays with their students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker right from creating the application, applying in colleges , training's and making them job ready .
05/01/24, 5:08 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I'm really looking forward to such an opportunity
