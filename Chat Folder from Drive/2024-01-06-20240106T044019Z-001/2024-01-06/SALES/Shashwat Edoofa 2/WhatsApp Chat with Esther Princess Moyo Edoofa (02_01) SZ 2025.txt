03/01/24, 2:36 pm - +260 96 2686427: My name is Nicholas Moyo born on the 25th of May 1979 in Ndola Zambia ,I am a Zimbabwean by descent .I am currently persuing a PhD in Natural Medicine. Iam a Naturopathic Medicine Therapist since Feb 1998.Iam a Christian attending the Seventh Day Adventist Church.I and my family are Vegetarians including Esther.I got married to Patricia Moyo on 28 May 2003 on Charpter 37 in Zimbabwe ,this is a legal Marriage.We are Blessed with 5 Children ,1 daughter (Esther Princess Moyo ) and 4 sons .Esther is the eldest child .Both myself and my wife Patricia do practice Natural Therapies. This is our main source of income.
We are also small scale farmers growing grains,nuts ,vegetables and we have also started to plant fruit trees and medicinal Herbs.In Naturopath I do specialise in 
Arthritis
Cancer
Pain Management

We are a humble family which have not yet acquired much assets and due to the Economic Instability in our Country Zimbabwe :
It is very difficult to supply all our basic needs 
To fully pay the tuition fees on time 

But we hope the Lord will  open more windows so we improve our income flow.

Coming to our daughter Esther Princess Moyo:

Esther is born on 1 July 2004
She is our only daugher amongst 4 sons .She is of quiet character but with High Intellectual Capabilities. As the only daughter I forsee loneliness since she has noone to pair with ,but Tye Lord has blessed us with my wife's daughter now residing with us.
Esther is a Studious person 
She likes reading and Researching, she is an optimistic person hence she even got your contacts. I thought it fit for her to Study Medicine due to her caring spirit ,I see the way she takes care of her siblings .But she has chosen Social Work which is also good.She has chosen to be a sociologist.
She bottles most of her things 
she doesnt easily opens up ,she confides a lot.

The only weaknesses I know is on her Physical Health but not on character:She suffered Anaemia in her infancy and this has affected her physical Health.
Spiritually ,Mentally and Socially she is profound.

Esther is also a good Machinist ,her mother together with her school trained her in Fashion and Fabrics .She can even design and make her own dresses and costumes.This is an added advantage. 
We have trained our children to practice strict economy. She can survive in hard conditions with very little means .Survival skills.

I have never heard at school
church
Community
she being evil spoken of 
Even myself as a parent  I thank God for that character she has

Thank you <This message was edited>

05/01/24, 5:18 pm - +260 96 2686427: Besides the education fraternities even the health care facilities 
Most patients are referred to India for chronic illnesses diseases and infirmities but rarely have I heard of corpses returning in turn but a well improved person.

India stands as an unbeatable giant in NATUROPATHIC MODALITIES 
I ALSO VALUE THE DIGNIFIED MODE OF DRESS

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.

This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
