05/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes we can  start
05/01/24, 9:17 am - Harmehak: Did you follow all the shared resources and information?
05/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I did
05/01/24, 9:20 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What's your take on the information you learnt yesterday?

Did you find it helpful and interesting?
05/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I found it helpful and I had more insight about India
05/01/24, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 77 103 0085: No
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 103 0085: Wonderful it's affordable
05/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 103 0085: The program earn while you earn is of utmost importance and beneficial since it enables a student to reduce the remaining annual fee
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I understand
05/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, active and thorough participation is very important.
05/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I'm following
05/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 103 0085: Wonderful experience so with more accomplished assignments you will be able to gain more scholarship credits
05/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
05/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I am ready
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 103 0085: Around 1500 or more
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 103 0085: Okay so I will have to pay 350 by 31 January as enrolment fee
05/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: It's paid once/if you qualify and receive an acceptance letter.
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 103 0085: Okay I understand
05/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 103 0085: I totally agree with you
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 103 0085: Oh okay. Things are hard in Africa
05/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: We do understand please.
05/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Considering the same we do understand and this is why we aim at providing Affordable, Accessible and Employable education to our students!
05/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes it's true
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Indeed please!
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I understand
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Meaning that classes are likely  to resume in august
05/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Okay
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Ok let me get in touch with her thank you
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

While I hope you are still in contact with Justine?
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same are you aware that Justine is currently in India?
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I'm still in contact with him
05/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Yes he told me
05/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Do connect your parents with Justine as well.
05/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I will
05/01/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
