I've worked hard to get where I am today, and this scholarship would help me to continue my education and achieve my goals with this scholarship.l am currently in High School at an Upper Six level at Girls High School Harare.

But it is really great to know about as well.
02/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
02/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Well Mazviita now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I think its a life changing decision since l will be able to develop new skills and perspectives and also other cultures and lifelong connections. I can also be able to start a new life in that country.
02/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Very correct and in that case would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Mazviita?
02/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I am fully prepared to go study abroad because l have done my research on the host country and culture.
02/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Mazviita, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
02/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I have discussed with them and they would love to see me study abroad and support me but they do not have the finance to assist me.
02/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the financial aspect, Mazviita?
02/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Well my family won't be able to help me budget for tuition, housing,food and transportation costs and the cost of living abroad.
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: While I understand,

May I know how are you planning your higher education?
02/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 615 7802: For now l am planning to do Business Management but if l don't have finance l might have to wait until my family can afford to pay for my fees for University
02/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mazviita.

So what is your understanding of the financial aspect of the scholarship?
02/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I understood that you can provide fully funded scholarship
02/01/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
02/01/24, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
03/01/24, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 615 7802: Morning how are you
03/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes we can
03/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
03/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Were you able to go through the same yesterday, Mazviita?
03/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes l was and l now know the difference
03/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: I am glad!
03/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Mazviita, may I know who was the one supporting your sibling's higher education financially?
03/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 615 7802: They graduated recently
03/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Could you please address the question as well for me? <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 615 7802: The first one graduated in 2020 and the second one in 2022
03/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Alright Mazviita,

However my question is who supported them financially in UZ?
03/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 615 7802: My parents and the other one was on a scholarship
03/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

Duly noted, Mazviita!
03/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes Ms Harmehak
03/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: I believe you understand that you would require financial support along with scholarship!

So are your parents willing to support you for the same?
03/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 615 7802: It depends if the finance needed is affordable
03/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Mazviita, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
03/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes l agree the same
03/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: So given the finances are less than those in Zimbabwe, are they willing to support?
03/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am
03/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 615 7802: If the money is paid in installments
03/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mazviita
03/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am l am very confident and l am working hard to pass all my subjects
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great
03/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Business Administration?
03/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Mazviita_Edoofa(28/12)HP" to "Mazviita_Edoofa(28/12)HP 2025"
03/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: @263776157802

03/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 615 7802: No we are not aware
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Does this cost last for 4 years
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 615 7802: So l have to write tests in order to qualify for the program?
03/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: This is the cost for a year without scholarship.
03/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: You would go through test and interview stage.
03/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mazviita, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow that would be really great
03/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Okay well noted
03/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Okay ma'am
03/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mazviita
03/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Mazviita, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am
03/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Wouldn't you agree to the same?
03/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Thats very true
03/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I definitely agree
03/01/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mazviita?
03/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes l am
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Okay ma'am
03/01/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
03/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 615 7802: So its a program whereas l work while l'm learning at the same time
03/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow thats great
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Noted
03/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow this would be really great
03/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow its all about hard work
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am l do
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am l am ready
03/01/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Mazviita, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/01/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 615 7802: $1500-$2250
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 615 7802: For how many universities
03/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow thats great
03/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes l do
03/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
03/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Noted
03/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Wow that's great
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
03/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
03/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Okay noted
03/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Please?
03/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am l did
03/01/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

03/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Yes yes
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Do connect your parents as well.
03/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

05/01/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 615 7802: To be honest l haven't found the right time to discuss with my family and l didn't know what to say.
05/01/24, 9:11 am - Harmehak: You could have informed me, Mazviita
05/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes ma'am sorry about that
05/01/24, 9:15 am - Harmehak: I do understand
05/01/24, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Were you able to discuss with them yesterday?
05/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 615 7802: Not yet they are not around
05/01/24, 9:18 am - Harmehak: You haven't met them since Wednesday please?
05/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes
05/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: I believe your parents did follow the discussion in the group itself, isn't it?
05/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 615 7802: Yes my father did he hasn't responded
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
05/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 615 7802: No ma'am we havent
05/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same, Mazviita?
05/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 615 7802: I'm waiting for a decision that will be made by my family
05/01/24, 9:46 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
05/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 347 4444: Thank you for the Scholarship opportunities Ma'am. We as parents support plays plausible and genuine scholarship offers but after following your discussions and substance or gist of the Erdofan program my evaluation is that it lacks the basic criteria of sustainability. I am a recipient of scholarship in the UK and USA at University level. As such i wouldn't recommend my daughter to pursue this scholarship
05/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 347 4444: Support plausible
05/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate where you stated that Edoofa lacks the basic criteria of sustainability, Mr Farai?
05/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: It's Edoofa Program, please.
05/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 347 4444: We do not have money for the application process or procedure or contribute in part for tuition etc in the event you offer the scholarship which to me appears a red herring
05/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 347 4444: Whatever sorry
05/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Do you believe close to 2000 families would have trusted their children with Edoofa, Mr Farai?
05/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I hope you are aware that Mazviita got to know about the program from *Abigail, who is currently in India itself through the Edoofa scholarship program*?
05/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I would appreciate if you would make thorough research first and then come to any such conclusions.
05/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 347 4444: Thank you but i am of the opinion it's not necessary to research and discern the ddifference between   a scholarship and sponsorship. What we want is a full school scholarship covering air fares to from  India tuition fees accomodarion and monthly stipend or allowance
05/01/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed it is, Mr Farai.

Mazviita did happen to have an initial discussion with her friend Abigail as well!
05/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I believe Mazviita herself happened to acknowledge the expenses in universities like UZ as well.
05/01/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Along with the difference that I explained thoroughly during the start of the discussion as well.

Despite being asked if the parents are willing to support where she acknowledged, may I know if you were following the discussion earlier then as well?
05/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 347 4444: Thank you so much i appreciate the thrust your Organisation toward towards  supporting education broadly
05/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Do take time to firstly follow the entire discussion and connect with Mrs Ruth, who is herself a parent who has two daughters currently in India.
05/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 347 4444: Superb thank for the invaluable assistance
05/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
05/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 347 4444: God bless. I am thankful and grateful. Its an indication of your commitment
05/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: I hope so far your queries are cleared and addressed?
05/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 347 4444: I followed from the onset. Kindly place me to a bigger group where the many beneficiaries or recipients of your program interact  sharing their testimonies in comparison to this limited group???
05/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Mr Farai, every student is alloted an Individual Group for their counseling session.

Later on this stage you would be connecting with the Program Director for a video call interview as well.

05/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 347 4444: It's not necessary at this stage
05/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 347 4444: It's not necessary as I would rather she focuses on her  present or current  studies
05/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same?

Since you have concerns, don't you believe it's best to connect with a parent who has her children in India as we speak?
05/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
06/01/24, 4:04 am - +263 77 347 4444: Please offer a fully funded scholarship. Its a distraction for a student to work. Besides it should be difficult for a foreign student to get a job in India. Under the circumstances its not worthwhile. Thank you for extending a. helping hand
