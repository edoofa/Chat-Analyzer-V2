26/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes he's the former president of my school
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

Are you aware we are proudly associated with your school as well, Ruvimbo?
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Well Ruvimbo now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I believe  that studying abroad is a life changing decision because i can get quality education , job opportunities are quite many and living standards are better than here
26/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: You see, Ruvimbo, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Thank you for understanding Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: So Ruvimbo, given the opportunity, would you say you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes I am sure I am mentally prepared for a life abroad
26/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Ruvimbo, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
26/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I agree with you on that and yes my family is in support of my plans to study abroad as they're seeing a great opportunity for my success
26/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I am confident Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I have a question Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
26/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Do I get the opportunity to work there in India after graduation
26/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
26/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Okay thank you Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Banking and Finance ?
26/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I have 2As ,6Bs and 3Cs.
26/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Then A Level i was doing Pure Maths, Business Studies and Economics

26/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Ruvimbo's network connection is poor
26/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
26/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I am interested in in learning about how money works and how to make the most of it..I am also interested in the complex world of economics and how it affects our lives. I want to help people make sound financial decisions and help businesses succeed

27/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion, Ruvimbo?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 369 0953: Yes I did
27/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Ruvimbo.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
27/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 369 0953: Umm I really don't know
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 369 0953: Oh okay Ma'am
27/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: In simple words Ruvimbo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
27/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 369 0953: Okay Ms Harmehak thank you
27/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Ruvimbo?
27/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 369 0953: I have a question Ma'am
27/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 369 0953: I want to understand more about the Earn while you learn program so can you please brief me on that?
27/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Ruvimbo.
27/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 369 0953: Okay thank you I now clearly understand
27/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: That's great
27/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 369 0953: Yes
27/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Ruvimbo, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 369 0953: I totally agree Ma'am
27/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Ruvimbo?
27/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 369 0953: Yes Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad
27/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 369 0953: Okay Ma'am
27/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 369 0953: Okay that's good then
27/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 369 0953: Yes I can see
27/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the resources please?
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 369 0953: Yes I did
27/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Yes
27/12/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Ruvimbo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 369 0953: 1500-2250
27/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: You see, Ruvimbo, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 369 0953: I do
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay Ma'am
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Yes Ma'am I did
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

27/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay
27/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
27/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

27/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay thank you
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Okay should I do it now?
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: You surely can please.
27/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: You and your mother can have a direct call as well.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.✅

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.✅
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.✅
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.✅
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness✅
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

28/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 886 4487: It is true that many Africans have poor diets, and one of the contributing factors is the state of agriculture in many African countries. Poor infrastructure, such as lack of access to clean water and electricity, can make it difficult for farmers to grow enough food to feed their families. In addition, inefficient farming methods can lead to low yields and poor quality produce. These factors can result in food insecurity and malnutrition, which are common problems in Africa. Let me give you some other perspectives on this topic.  it's important to consider the role of colonialism in shaping Africa's agricultural systems. Colonialism disrupted traditional farming methods and led to the exploitation of natural resources. Additionally, many colonial powers established cash crop economies, which led to the neglect of food crops and increased dependence on food imports. It's also important to consider the impact of climate change on African agriculture. Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events can have devastating effects on crops and livestock. Third, it's important to consider the role of conflict in disrupting agricultural systems.

28/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I will tell my story.........                    I am Ruvimbo Chitanda the last born in a family of three girls.My mother passed away when I was doing grade 1 and my father passed away when I was doing grade 5 .My aunt who's my mother's sister took us in and cared for us .She is the only family member who cared .She didn't have a well paying job so she struggled to send us to better schools as they were expensive . I was a really bright well behaved student in primary school and my teachers didn't have any problem with me .I passed my grade 7 examination with 6 units but still I couldn't go to a good school due to financial problems..Then this other time a sponsor came to assist less privileged children at my previous primary school..So my teachers from primary school pleaded with the sponsor to assist me as they saw a brighter future ahead of me as they believed that I could excel in a better school ..Mind you this sponsor only wanted to help primary children but ended up sending me a secondary school student to a good boarding school..I was beyond excited and honored to have that opportunity .The sponsor gave me everything from food stuffs , books and uniforms .I worked hard in Ordinary level and he continued paying for my fees until Advanced Level. So this taught me to always work hard and behave whether at school or at home because hard work and good behavior always pays off

29/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes
29/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
29/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

29/12/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Okay
29/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023 for $200 and the  4th or 5th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
03/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 369 0953: Thank you so much.... ma'am... wonderful

04/01/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well.

I believe by now you must have read the acceptance letter thoroughly.

I am here to address if you have any queries for me!

Shall we start with our session?
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes we can start ma'am..I do not have queries
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Were you thoroughly able to discuss the acceptance letter with Mrs Casemary, Ruvimbo?
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes ma'am I was
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Shall I brief you about the payment modes for a better clarity, Ruvimbo?
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes please
04/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
04/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
