04/01/24, 3:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very expensive course even after scholarship as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that. (Annually cost after scholarship is some where around $35000 to $45000 per year)

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-10 years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue

So are your parents for this or they are looking more a more affordable course ?
