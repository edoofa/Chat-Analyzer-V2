21/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Yes l did
21/12/23, 4:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
21/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 727 9725: No we are not Ms Garima
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 4:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!

22/12/23, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Audrey what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 727 9725: Ok l understand
22/12/23, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
22/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 727 9725: Yes Ms Garima
22/12/23, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/12/23, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 727 9725: Its okay Ms Garima 

Very interesting
22/12/23, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
22/12/23, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
22/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 727 9725: Yes l think so

22/12/23, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Indeed Audrey.
22/12/23, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 727 9725: It is Ms Garima
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
22/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 727 9725: 3.Earn While you learn
22/12/23, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
22/12/23, 1:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Audrey, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
22/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Yes they would be
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Audrey, can your parents acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note that they will be helping you mentally and financially in your education abroad?*
22/12/23, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
22/12/23, 2:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since we are about to complete your counseling session, I hope you can be active for the next 15 minutes so that we can complete the same properly?
22/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 131 7888: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Am now active Ms Garima my network was acting up
22/12/23, 2:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Dulyn noted @263771317888
22/12/23, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright let's continue.
22/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Ok
22/12/23, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Adurey, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now that we have covered everything from the counseling session, let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Yes l am
22/12/23, 2:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Audrey as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying to multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 727 9725: The studentwill end up spending $1500
22/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 727 9725: If it is $300 at every university
22/12/23, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/12/23, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: We know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the word which is why we have decided for this slowdown period that a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.

Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350
22/12/23, 2:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
22/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Alright Ms Garima
22/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 727 9725: I understand  Ms Garima
22/12/23, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/12/23, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Ok Ms Garima
22/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Audrey, as we have discussed the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
22/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Ok
22/12/23, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Audrey can you please share your understanding on the same? <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am waiting for you response.
22/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 727 9725: As a student apply to certain universities there is a application fee that is paid.Edoofa makes the application fee affordable for the students.For a student to be part of the Edoofa program he or she would only have to pay $750 called the enrollment fee
22/12/23, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/12/23, 2:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Audrey, I hope now you have understood the financial aspects?
22/12/23, 3:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since this is a crucial part of your counseling session I would request you become active and finish your counseling session.
22/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Okay
22/12/23, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Audrey, I hope now you have understood the financial aspects?
22/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Yes l did
22/12/23, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, Audrey I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
22/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 727 9725: I understand
22/12/23, 3:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
22/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 727 9725: No am not
22/12/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa changed the group name from "Audrey Patience_EDOOFA(20/12)GJ" to "Audrey Patience_EDOOFA(20/12)GJ 2025"
22/12/23, 3:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 3:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/12/23, 3:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Ok l understand
22/12/23, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
22/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 727 9725: Okay
22/12/23, 3:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 3:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
22/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 727 9725: No
22/12/23, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/12/23, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

22/12/23, 4:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/12/23, 4:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Saturday on “23-12-23” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision.

23/12/23, 9:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263717279725 @263771317888, Hope you all are doing well.
23/12/23, 9:27 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed yesterday I am here to continue with our session. Shall we start?
23/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 727 9725: Yes
23/12/23, 9:39 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what all did you discuss with your family members?
23/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 727 9725: Right now we dont have money
23/12/23, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: What aspects have you covered in your discussions with them, and what specific challenges are they currently facing? If you and your parents could openly share the difficulties you're encountering, I might be able to assist you better. By understanding your concerns, I can offer a more flexible plan. I've been able to help other students who approached me with their challenges as a friend and a part of the family.
23/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 727 9725: We are five in our family and the second born is starting form one at a new school and the last born is also starting grade one at a new school , My parents dont have enough money to cover the expenses
23/12/23, 10:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Which particular amount are your parents currently expressing concern about? Have they engaged in a discussion with Mrs. Ruth to understand how the scholarship aided her in covering the fees? Initially, she harbored doubts about affording fees abroad for both her daughters, considering her status as a small-scale farmer with no income. However, through the Earn While You Learn program, she has successfully enabled both her daughters to study law in India and is now entirely self-financing their fees.
23/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 727 9725: Okay
23/12/23, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if your parents have connected with Mrs. Ruth?
23/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 727 9725: They didnot
23/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 727 9725: What should they ask to Mrs Ruth
23/12/23, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know the reason why they did not connect with her?
23/12/23, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
23/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 727 9725: Their phones were out of battery. There is a crisis of Electricity in Zimbabwe
23/12/23, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand Audrey. I had a discussion with the academic board, However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! Keeping that in mind we have a limited number of slots left for 90%-100% scholarships, so I would want you to discuss the same with your parents so that I can get your application approved by the higher board for a 90%-100% scholarship. <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: And would also want your parents to take active part in the session, so that if they have any query I can assist them with the same.
23/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 727 9725: Okay noted
23/12/23, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so in that case,@263717279725  I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
23/12/23, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: In the mean time can you please answer these questions.
23/12/23, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/12/23, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your reply, but I guess you were occupied, I will connect with you on *Tuesday again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue our conversation with a fresh mind.
As we approach the festive season, I want to take a moment to wish you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas. May this special time bring joy, peace, and prosperity to you all. I hope the holiday season fills your home with warmth and your heart with happiness.

Best wishes for a wonderful Christmas and a New Year brimming with blessings and success. ⭐ <This message was edited>
