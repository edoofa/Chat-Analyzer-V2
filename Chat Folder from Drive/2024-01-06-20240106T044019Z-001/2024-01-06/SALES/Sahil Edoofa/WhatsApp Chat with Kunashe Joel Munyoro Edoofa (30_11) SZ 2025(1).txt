With its intricate and robust democratic framework, India's legislative system has successfully managed the complexities of a vast and diverse nation. The country's Parliament, with its two houses, serves as a vital platform for open debates, lawmaking, and representation of the diverse voices within the nation. India's legislature not only upholds the principles of democracy but also plays a pivotal role in shaping the nation's policies and fostering a vibrant and participatory democracy that serves as a model for democracies worldwide!

16/12/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Ok. Thank you
16/12/23, 5:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Joel to India for his higher studies!

16/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Sure. India is fine

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 329 9936: Yes. Good morning
18/12/23, 10:02 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Alfred!
18/12/23, 10:02 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
18/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 329 9936: I am not so familiar but I just have a glimpse
18/12/23, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Alfred! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/12/23, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
18/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Alfred. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
18/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 329 9936: I don't have
18/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*“The great aim of education is not knowledge, but action.” - Herbert Spencer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
19/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Alfred!
19/12/23, 1:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
19/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
19/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

19/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Thank you for your time and information
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
19/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yes I had comprehended
19/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
19/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 329 9936: No 2
19/12/23, 2:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Alfred! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
19/12/23, 2:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 329 9936: They really appreciate it
19/12/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Joel studying abroad?
19/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Personally I really support it
19/12/23, 2:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
19/12/23, 2:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
19/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yaa that's correct
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

*"In the garden of learning, every student is a blooming flower with the potential to paint the world with the colors of wisdom." - Anonymous*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
20/12/23, 9:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Alfred!
20/12/23, 9:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
20/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Morning. I had understood it clearly
20/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
20/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 329 9936: I will be able to make the payment but my son is writing his A level in 2024 and would like to be enrolled in 2025
20/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your message, please?
20/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 329 9936: I am saying my son is in L6 and is going to write his A level next year. So he will be registering for Tertiary education in2025
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mr. Alfred. You will be glad to know that we are open for the 2025 intake!
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?

21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 329 9936: Yes
21/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 329 9936: It's clear to me
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
