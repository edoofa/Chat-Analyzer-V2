I welcome you to this session

*I am Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
05/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 335 2606: Greetings to you too.I'm available
05/01/24, 11:09 am - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
05/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 335 2606: I'm fine and how are you too?
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
05/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 335 2606: For now they are unavailable so is it okay if I add them later on?
05/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
05/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 71 335 2606: Okay I'll add my mother
05/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 335 2606: Should I send you her number since I'm not the group admin?
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Kunal: I have made you the admin, please add them
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Kunal: Please add your father as well
05/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 335 2606: I need to talk to him first about the programme, he's not available. So I'll add my mother first
05/01/24, 11:54 am - ~ Lwandie💋 added +263 77 532 3162
05/01/24, 12:00 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your father because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
05/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 335 2606: Okay
05/01/24, 12:01 pm - ~ Lwandie💋 added +263 77 235 5738

We have received the application of Leeanne for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
05/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: Leeanne, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:
1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your understandings of the program as discussed with Thandekile?
05/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 335 2606: 1.Attending university after completing high school for me has always been one of my biggest dreams not to mention studying abroad.So considering the recent tertiary education fee hikes in our country,i decided to go through a couple of scholarship programmes.That's when my friend Thandekile introduced me to the Edoofa earn while you learn scholarship programme.I was really impressed to find out that  it allows me to earn while learning in order to lessen the financial burden on ny parents.
2.The earn while you learn programme earns me scholarship credits which contribute to my tuition fees,meaning at the end of the semester or so my parents get to pay less fees.
05/01/24, 12:33 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!
