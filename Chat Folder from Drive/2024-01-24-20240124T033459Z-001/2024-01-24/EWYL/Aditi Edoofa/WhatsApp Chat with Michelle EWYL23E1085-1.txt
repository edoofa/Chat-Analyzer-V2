As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 19/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
19/1/24, 4:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Mitchelle, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
19/1/24, 4:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

19/1/24, 4:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session Monday onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
