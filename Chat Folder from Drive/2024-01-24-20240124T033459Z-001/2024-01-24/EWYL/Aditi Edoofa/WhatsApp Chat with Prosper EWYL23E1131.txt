22/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 280 4603: I am Dr Joyce Mathwasa Prosper’s grandmother. I have been monitoring his education from the beginning hence the interest now. I appreciate your assistance in ensuring he secured a position in the suitable university
22/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 280 4603: Others who joined are family but may not be able to effectively interact with you
22/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Dr. Joyce Mathwasa Prosper's grandmother,

It's a pleasure to connect with you, and I appreciate your involvement in monitoring Dr. Joyce's education journey. It's wonderful to hear about your interest and support in ensuring their academic success.
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263778956269 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 895 6269: One of my long term goals is to get an LLB degree, and i think the EWYL program will help me in achieving this as it will help me reduce learning expenses, thereby making me to further progress with my education
22/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a commendable long-term goal! Pursuing an LLB degree requires dedication and hard work, and it's great that you see the EWYL program as a valuable resource in achieving this aspiration. Reducing learning expenses can indeed make a significant difference, allowing you to focus on your studies without additional financial burdens.
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Also, the EWYL program will help me improve my communication skills, which is also one of my long term goals. I believe in the EWYL program, therw will be interactions and communications, so hence, this will improve my communication skills
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! It will help you very much!
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 895 6269: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, can you elaborate on your understanding.
22/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 895 6269: No, please do explain them for me
22/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 895 6269: That's right
22/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes ma'am
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Clearly understood
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Absolutely
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
22/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes i did
22/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 895 6269: It sure is
22/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
22/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 895 6269: That sounds absolutely amazing
22/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
22/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 895 6269: *-Ms Aditi, who is my EWYL program mentor*

*- Ms Sanjana, the Head of Department*
22/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 895 6269: 2. To ensure that my academic journey is great
To equip me with 21st century skills in preparation for the real world workplace

23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Okay so i understood that in the corporate alliances, one will Identify local Organizations/ Companies in their countries and regions. After that, they are to
identify the decision-makers who work in these Companies and reach out to them to share Edoofa’s vision, mission.
This may be done using the LinkdIn application

Also, the companies should be financially stable, and also the scale of the companies should not be too  small or too big
23/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 895 6269: I also understood that the background of the founder is also crucial
