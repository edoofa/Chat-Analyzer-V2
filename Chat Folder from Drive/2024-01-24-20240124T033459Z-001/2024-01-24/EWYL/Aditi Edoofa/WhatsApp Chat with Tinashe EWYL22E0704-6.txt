What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?I am a very intelligent student who desires to pursue further her education.I yearn to support my family financially but because of lack of employment I am failing to find a job in order to help them,I know they cannot afford  to further support my studies financially as I am blessed with lot of siblings behind me who also are trying to get educated so instead I choose to seek help when  i heard about Edoofa Scholarship Program .So ,to further pursue my education which cannot afford same as my parents.Adding on I have also learned that Edoofa Scholarship Program is the best for me because as a student I can learn ,work and earn at the same time .Moreover Edoofa stays with student throughout their academic courses mentoring them to be job ready and self efficient in today life.I look forward in getting a scholarship from Edoofa Scholarship Program.
