23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delayed response. Unfortunately, I missed your message as I joined one day later due to being unwell and on leave on the day when you shared that message. Thank you. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay 
I understand that
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Always ready
23/1/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will start our session now onwards from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 1:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted with caution
23/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Thank you for this welcoming message . I will be glad to work with you as well
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Well my mother has joined the group as well using @263778047815
23/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to her for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Currently she is not available
As she is at work. But I will notify her of your presence
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So now, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Beyond all that the EWYL program offers. I had desires to
be a CEO of back-end website developer company involved in selling new technological advancement devices. So EWYL program would set a foundation for me to create my own opportunities and maybe help me to be a decision maker
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your ambition to become a CEO in the field of back-end website development and new technological devices. The EWYL program indeed seems like a stepping stone to lay the foundation for your aspirations, providing valuable skills and experiences.
23/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 274 4769: I am digesting it deeper
23/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Well you can brief me on that
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted 1st point
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted 2nd point
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Great to know you all
I hope to work with you well
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Great news
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
