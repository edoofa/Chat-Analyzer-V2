15/1/24, 9:42 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Dear Mentor, my name is Memory Chimchenga and my EWYL group name is EWYL23E1114. I am excited to begin my EWYL journey. As discussed with the admissions team. I am committed to being available on Tuesday (16-jan-2024)to commence the procedures kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximise the benefits and start on the right trade.
16/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Memory, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
16/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
16/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:48 AM - +265 880 26 63 24: I am well and I hope you are well too
16/1/24, 9:52 AM - +265 880 26 63 24: This is really inspiring and I also hope we will make a great team
16/1/24, 10:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
16/1/24, 10:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session *from today* onwards from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 1:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:31 AM - +265 880 26 63 24: OK sure
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
16/1/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Are you prepared for the session? 🎯
16/1/24, 1:35 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes I am
16/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make. I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I have shared the group link
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, so now I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
16/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 888 99 61 75 joined using this group's invite link
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: My long term go is to become a lab technician mostly specialised in haematology. Through the earn while you learn program, I will be able to earn scholarship credits depending on my work output, this will help lower my tuition fees.This means that I will be able to learn and acquire the knowledge needed for me to achieve my goals because the cost of education becomes more affordable with the EWYL progam. At the same time, I will be able to gain employability skills which will help me in the future in achieving my goals.
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic and well-thought-out plan! Pursuing your long-term goal of becoming a specialized lab technician in hematology is commendable. The Earn While You Learn program indeed offers a unique opportunity by making your education more affordable. This dual benefit of learning and earning, coupled with gaining valuable employability skills, sets you on a promising path towards achieving your aspirations. Keep up the determination, and I wish you great success in your educational and professional journey!
16/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/1/24, 1:58 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Thank you so much
16/1/24, 1:59 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I think I do
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, can you tell me about your understanding of these objectives?
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: According to my understanding, the objectives are for students to gain experience and scholarship credits to reduce portion of high education fees since EWYL is an employability program
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:13 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I now have a better understanding of the objectives
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Okay sure, I am glad and really grateful because of their availability
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, they are also honored to have you
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Very interesting indeed
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

22/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I understand that project 1,cooperate alliance is all about me identifying and getting connected to targeted companies,local organisations telling that how the edoofa program is helping me with skills for future employability,in the process i get to learn how the market works and gaining industry exposure and high chances for future employability

After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me! <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: One factor to consider in choosing the company is its nature,it must be student-centric or  technological or recreational.In identifying the program,first you need to search on google,then dig deep into their websites,understanding their founders and background information on different platforms and then approaching their managers with an invitation note
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently, *this project is on hold* due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 2:25 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Okay i understand
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting tomorrow with the same enthusiasm.🌺

Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Good afternoon
23/1/24, 1:42 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: My understanding of the  audio it that the second program is community building which mainly involves making connections and strengthening relationships among individuals to create a community working towards achieving Common goals.it involves networking  to offer an opportunity to other african students so that they can also join the edoofian society
23/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/1/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in MSCE:-
Current Class ( Form 5/ Form 6/ MSCE Appeared):

I will be appearing for my MSCE (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Okay sure
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Very exciting indeed!🙂
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Okay
23/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MEMORY/ADITI*
23/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
