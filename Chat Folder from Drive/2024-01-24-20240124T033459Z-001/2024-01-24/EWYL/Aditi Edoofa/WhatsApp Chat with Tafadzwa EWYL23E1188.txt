Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's session🚀
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Morning to you too
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 78 378 6270: My sister's husband and my brother, my sisters are yet to join
23/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
23/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Thank you very much
23/1/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Tafadzwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Being able to further my education going through university it is my biggest long term goal in that, If l am able to be granted the chance to get a place in a university. 
A university is going to make me have more knowledge about the course that l always dreamt of doing which is Psychology. It has always been one of my goals too so as l further my education through university will be able to be better and well educated in that course and all of my goals start through getting into university and acquiring knowledge about the course deeper. Also through out the journey want to be able to have a huge impact  in the society through I want to be able to finish my education and further it even more until l am a renowned psychologist that has started up organizations for those people in need of  care and time to be listened to especially the issues and problems they can not share with anyone. I want to be able to have campaigns against staying silent when one is mentally depressed. One person's health matters especially emotionally and mentally, people have to know about the dangers of depression and anxiety. After everything else want to have a positive impact in the society...these are my long term goals
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 378 6270: The EWYL will help me in getting more skills be it interaction with other people since the course that l want focuses more on interaction too with people and will help in getting the scholarship credits that will make it easy for me to further my education since l will be having fees to pay that will be manageable and more family friendly....
23/1/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals are truly inspiring, aiming not only for personal growth through education but also to make a meaningful impact on society, particularly in mental health awareness and support. Pursuing Psychology is a noble path, and your vision for starting organizations and campaigns against mental health challenges showcases your commitment to creating positive change.

It's great to hear that you see the Earn While You Learn program as a valuable resource for acquiring skills and earning scholarship credits. The program's focus on interaction and the flexibility it offers in managing fees align well with your aspirations.
23/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
23/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Do not understand
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Okay , noted
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes, very interesting
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

23/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
