23/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand. My parents and my sister are also part of the group
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Junior, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 250 1277: My long-term goals are more far-reaching and encompass my career and personal life. First, I hope to find a job in my field of study, where I can utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of a company. Second, I would like to continue learning and expanding my skills throughout my career, so that I can advance in my chosen field. Third, I have personal goals of becoming financially independent and living a life that I find fulfilling. I hope to find a balance between my work life and personal life, so that I can be successful in both areas and I think I see the EWYL Program offered by Edoofa providing me with the basis to horn in on all these skills. I believe time management will be essential for the program and for my career goals. Learning to balance work and studies helps students like myself develop the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. There's need for self-discipline which in completing work and studies on a schedule helps students develop self-discipline and self-motivation to name but a few.
23/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals reflect a well-rounded vision, combining both professional and personal aspirations. Seeking a job in your field of study, continuous learning, financial independence, and achieving a fulfilling life are commendable objectives.

It's great to see that you recognize the importance of skills like time management, self-discipline, and self-motivation in achieving these goals. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program can indeed play a crucial role in providing a foundation for developing and honing these skills, as well as offering flexibility to balance work and studies.
23/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
23/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I have understood
23/1/24, 9:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you
