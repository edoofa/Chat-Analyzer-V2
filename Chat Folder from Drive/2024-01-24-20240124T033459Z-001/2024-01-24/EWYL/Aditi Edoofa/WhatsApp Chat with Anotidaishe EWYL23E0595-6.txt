11/1/24, 5:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for not being able to begin your sessions on 8 January 24 as I was caught up in our annual event for our India Edoofians which is *Slice Con'24!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The AI sessions were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Anotidaishe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Ever since I started learning, I always wanted to be like my mom's brother . He's a business man and he's excelling in all the things he's doing and it got to wonder that I have to be better and be like him or even better than. I want to be able to provide for my family and also be able to be a someone who contributes something useful to the community . I cannot say I'm that bright but I always try to reach my full potential and I think you teaching me the methods and being able to know more through the EWYL program will help me reach the goals of being a successful business owner and to be able to make sure that my family is okay and to be a useful citizen to the country
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations with such clarity and determination. Your commitment to not only achieve personal success but also contribute positively to your family and community is truly admirable. The drive to surpass the achievements of your uncle showcases a strong work ethic and ambition. I'm here to offer support and guidance as you embark on your journey, and I believe the EWYL program can provide valuable insights and methods to help you reach your goals. Remember, your dedication and willingness to learn are powerful assets on your path to success.
12/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 799 9362: I can't wait to be mind blown by insights you are going to give  , nothing makes me happy more than this. 
Thank you 🙏
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Woww! Thank you for your kind words!❤️
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 799 9362: No I'm hoping you would make me understand and help me to know  the two objectives.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 799 9362: You are welcome 🤗
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you for showing me the two goals , I think of I I work I will be able to reach and surpass those goals. I would love to help my parents to pay my tuition fees
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 799 9362: It's really nice to meet you , I can't really express how happy I am to he working with you all and seeking your guidance and advice through the way 
My name is Anotidaishe Victor Mukanga
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is awesome, they are also honored to have you.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you 🙏
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 799 9362: It sounds very interesting and I'm glad I will be doing something fun , it's been long since I've done that.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah ten minutes is enough.
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yes I would really enjoy to be in that section because I got to know how they learn to adjust to problems and I got on now that there some things we have in common with these students in the hall of fame
12/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you for wonderful session and have a wonderful weekend 🙏
12/1/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!

15/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
15/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Mr Angad Singh  uses a newsletter to interact with all the students
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 799 9362: In my own words the hall of inspiration is a section that shows what other students have done to endure all the hardships and situations they have encountered to be better leaders and people useful to the community. It shows the great deeds that the students have done.
15/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
15/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
15/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yes it's very clear. 
Thank you
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
15/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 799 9362: I think the document has all the information and ways on to create a skilled person when doing a certain job , from my own understanding it has many different projects that can help one reach a certain higher level
15/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
15/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
15/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 799 9362: I have finished listening to the audio file.
15/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 799 9362: So there is possible that students might internships through doing these EWYL programs and they get to interact with many successful people and get a clear picture of how to have a clear picture of being a skilled person.
15/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Indeed!
15/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Now that's clear. 
So what  you are saying is that a student has the potential to do many EWYL programs and projects
15/1/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
15/1/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

I have come to know that there are so many platforms, like Google , LinkedIn , etc and many other social media platforms which will help you to know the nature and the behaviour of a company and how they do their things. I've also learnt that there are steps you need to look at when searching for a company which are Nature of company, the size of the the company which is the scale of the company , how stable the company and also to look at how the founder is experienced and how wise the founder is.
I come to understand that it may be easy looking for a company if you follow those steps and accordingly and respectively

20/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 799 9362: This sounds so interesting!
20/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ANOTIDAISHE/ADITI*
20/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

20/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 799 9362: So the group will have many students and they have to be equipped and be able to know what edoofa is and we give them form to fill so that they know.
20/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 799 9362: And then from there we identify the right student. After being touch with my schoolmates who are currently form 6 students this year.
20/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
That' absolutely correct!
20/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
20/1/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 799 9362: There is a problem that students from my school are all at school and our boarding school doesn't allow phones so it is okay to look for other form 6 students from other schools as well
20/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure!
20/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
23/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 799 9362: So for them to understand we have to tell them more about edoofa and enlighten them on how edoofa is changing student's lives and helping them to shape their future 😊
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 799 9362: So I will ask the headmaster about the students who are able to pay if the school fees of that certain school is less than $100 and also I have to ask the headmaster for his students' so that we can create a community to educate them them more about edoofa.
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure!
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Okay. Just for a recap of everything we did and when I did not understand enough
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I mean if you have a question then you may ask, if not then we can move forward.
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 799 9362: I wanted to ask a question concerning the group. It has to have 60 and more students and also it will be divided into three
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright, though 60 is more like a target but the goal is to get good students who deserve to be in the scholarship program.
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 799 9362: So we have to look for students with potential who deserve to be in the scholarship
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, and those who are interested to study in India.
23/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Okay thank you for the clarification
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey.

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yes I am so excited 😊✨
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
