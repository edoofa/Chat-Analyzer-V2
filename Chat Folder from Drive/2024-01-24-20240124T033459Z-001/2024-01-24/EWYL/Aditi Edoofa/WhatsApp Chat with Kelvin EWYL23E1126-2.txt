20/1/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Congratulations on your recent achievements! It's wonderful to hear more about your background and journey. Being the firstborn in a family of five siblings must come with its own set of responsibilities, and your dedication to your education is truly commendable.

A huge congratulations are in order for successfully completing your Malawi School Certificate of Education with 14 points—that's an outstanding accomplishment! Your hard work and commitment have undoubtedly paid off.

Receiving an offer letter from Quest University through the Edoofa scholarship is a significant milestone. This opportunity opens up new horizons for your academic and personal growth. I'm genuinely thrilled for you and the exciting journey that lies ahead.
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you
20/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I don’t understand
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/1/24, 1:45 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Understood
20/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you for the introduction
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well noted
20/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes it is
20/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

20/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

22/1/24, 2:32 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am still reading it but am almost done
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We will discuss it tomorrow.
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Alright
23/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Good afternoon to you too, am doing fine how about you 

Let’s proceed
23/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: So my understanding is : the Earn While You Learn program is a program designed to make Edoofians to acquire the 21st century skills while they are still at school and these can help the to be the best after graduation. Through this program Edoofians also earn some credit that can be used to reduce their scholarship fees. The three ways how money can be gained are: first through Corporate Alliances and under this Edoofians are connected to the companies from their mother country and then work with them hand in hand and there good performance makes them to earn the credits. Second is through community where Edoofians try to advertise the Edoofa works to other students and if they are able to make a student reach the enrollment process and the students manages to pay it money is gained by the Edoofa and finally until when the student finishes all the processes credits are also gained. Finally through the African Schools Education Reform mission where an Edoofa gives names of a school from their mother country including the school they were and Edoofa contacts those schools and if the schools accept Edoofa and a student is also able to apply for the enrollment fee credits are also gained by the Edoofian.
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic, Kelvin!
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am done
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: We can now proceed
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: The Corparate alliance is meant to gain the wider understanding of the outside world markets. This is done online. This done by identifying companies from one’s mother’s country or the regions they are. These companies can be identified by acquiring it from family or friends or the internet by downloading a linked account and share them the objectives of Edoofa under this program and they can be able to connect you to the companies and work hand in hand with them. This can make the Edoofaians to increase their chances of getting jobs after education and even gain the experience of the outside world and how the companies are operating.
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
23/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 2:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you it’s also great to learn all these things about the EWYL Program
23/1/24, 2:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Does this mean that l need to share my understanding about the document tomorrow?
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Alright
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Continue having a great day see you tomorrow for the next lesson
