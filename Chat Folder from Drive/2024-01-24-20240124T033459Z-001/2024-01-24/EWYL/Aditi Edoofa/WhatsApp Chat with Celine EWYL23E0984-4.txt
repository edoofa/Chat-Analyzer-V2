12/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Celine, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes l am well thank you for asking
Yes am ready to start
12/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So I would like a response on this.
12/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 506 8620: My long term vision and goal is getting the best of tertiary education and become a successful lawyer and l'm hoping that the EWYL program will be very advantageous to me as it will help me sponsor my education through earning scholarship credits and l will also gain employability skills
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term vision and goals. Striving for the best in tertiary education and aspiring to become a successful lawyer is a commendable pursuit. I'm glad to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable resource on your journey. Earning scholarship credits to support your education and gaining employability skills are crucial steps toward achieving your aspirations.
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes sure
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 506 8620: No
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay l'm clear with that
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay thank you for the introduction it's my pleasure to be connecting with them
12/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

15/1/24, 2:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263775068620 May I know why you were not present in today's session.

16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Good afternoon how are you
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let's begin.
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263785347092  @263775068620  Are you there? <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes that sounds interesting
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

16/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
16/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 506 8620: That will be great indeed
