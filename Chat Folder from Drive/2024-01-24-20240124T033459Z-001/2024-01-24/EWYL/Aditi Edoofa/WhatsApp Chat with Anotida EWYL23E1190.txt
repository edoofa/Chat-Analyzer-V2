23/1/24, 8:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Nice to meet you Sir!
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Anotida, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I want to finish my degree and become one of the best lawyers in my country I think ENWYL Will help me to achieve my dreams and also it will help me to have skills for instance time management like what you said being and Edoofian you have to be punctual
23/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an excellent ambition! Completing your degree and aiming to become one of the best lawyers in your country is a remarkable goal. The EWYL program is indeed a valuable opportunity to not only support your academic journey but also equip you with essential skills, including time management. Punctuality is indeed crucial, and developing strong time management skills will serve you well in your studies and future endeavors.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 445 2768: That’s true ma’am
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 445 2768: I’m sure this program will help me in the future
23/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 71 445 2768: No I don’t
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Exciting news
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you
23/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am thank you
