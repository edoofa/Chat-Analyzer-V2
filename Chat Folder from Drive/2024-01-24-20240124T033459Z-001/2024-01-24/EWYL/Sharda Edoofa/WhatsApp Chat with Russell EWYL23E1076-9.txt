3.Student's journey with Edoofa Schoolarship program
6/1/24, 6:14 AM - +263 71 399 6403: 3. Student's journey with Edoofa Schoolarship program initially you submit the application form to the team. There is also one on one Counseling session with the Conselor and the parent is also involved. 
Eligibility check involves interview with the Academic Board member. After that the student receives the Acceptance letter from the board. Student's admission at the University. 
You work in hand with Earn while you learn mentor, gain skills and earn scholarship credits 
Lastly student prepares for travel to India (Visa assistance by the Admission team) 
4. I am going to write about a testimony of the twin sisters from Zimbabwe, Tapiwa and Lorraine Mandongwe. They were bred by their single mother and noone assisted them serve for Edoofa Schoolarship program. They started by Counseling session where everything is laid down for you by your Counselor and must not worry much about it. They also talked about interview which everyone thought its very difficult. The sisters searched everything on the internet and they made it. They were excited after being both accepted by Edoofa and received congratulations messages from their friends. Both of them were scared after the results were out. After both went India their mother were in touch with the Edoofa Conselor since she was doubting the Edoofa program. Her mother is also encouraging people not to doubt the Edoofa program. It's  so helpful. They went on saying that everything is laid down for you basically being given guidance. Their mother is also encouraging most parents to trust Edoofa.
If it was not the Edoofa program their mother could not afford to cater for two students' expenses. It was challenging the Edoofa understands and give people time to plan.
They also talked about Scholarship credits, and the good part of it you interact with different people (older and younger), you gain confidence and learn to speak to people. Although there were some few challenges such as having problems with Staffs your mentor knows how to handle it. Any problem you have with school in Campus or off Campus the Campus always support the issue. Both had faith with Edoofa.

Factors to be considered when looking for the right type of the companies

(b) scale for the company should not be either too big or too small. 
(c) financial stability-company selected must be financially sound by checking various sources like crunchbase, linkedIn and Inc42 media. 
(d) background of founder-companies with a founder having a strong background (interms of experiences and qualifications) are the most suitable ones.
