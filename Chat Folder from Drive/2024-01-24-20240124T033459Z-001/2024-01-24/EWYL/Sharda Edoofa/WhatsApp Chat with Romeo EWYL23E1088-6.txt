Ready for our session inspired by Sundar Pichai? He says, *"The core of what Google is about is bringing information to people."* Think of it like having the world's knowledge at your fingertips. Let's chat about how this idea can make our learning journey even more awesome.
17/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Good day Sharda I'm Romeo's father.
17/1/24, 8:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Sir
How are you doing?
17/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 378 4057: I'm doing good and how are you?
17/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that, thank you so much for asking.
17/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 77 378 4057: You are most welcome
17/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
17/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 378 4057: You may explain more
17/1/24, 9:17 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Romeo* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
17/1/24, 9:17 AM - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
17/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 378 4057: It is clear
17/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted

17/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
17/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 378 4057: Thank you for the introducion. We feel greatly honored to connect with such a resourceful team.
17/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sharda Edoofa: I am writing this message to inform you that I am not feeling well and, as a result, wasn't able to complete your call today. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. But don't worry, I will be available tomorrow and we will resume it with even more energy.
17/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm sorry for that .Get well soon.
18/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Romeo
As we embark on our session today, I'd like to share an inspiring quote that resonates deeply with our journey:

*"Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."*

This profound wisdom reminds us that while we may encounter various challenges, our power lies in how we respond and navigate through them. It's a testament to the resilience within each of us, shaping not just the path we walk but also the person we become.
18/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am feeling a lot better now, thank you.
18/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am unhappy with your absense in today's session.

If that is the concern, then is it possible for you to attend the session at 1:30pm or is it possible for your parents to attend the session on your behalf?
