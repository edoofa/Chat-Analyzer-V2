I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
