5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
11/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day_!
How are you?

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more.

16/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 832 4244: Not yet ma'am

16/1/24, 10:35 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me check
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 8:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Tanatswanashe!
How are you?
18/1/24, 8:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you know I am sure you know our daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line.
18/1/24, 8:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to is the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
18/1/24, 8:55 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.
22/1/24, 8:17 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Tanatswanashe

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *3:00 pm to 4:30 pm CAT*.

23/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 832 4244: Yes ma'am
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Alright, Tanatswanashe
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I was having a conversation with Ms. Saloni earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately.
