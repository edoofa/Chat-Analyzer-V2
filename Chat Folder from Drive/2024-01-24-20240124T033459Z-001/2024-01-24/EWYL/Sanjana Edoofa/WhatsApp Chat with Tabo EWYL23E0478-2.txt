6/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Tabo
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝

22/1/24, 8:11 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Tabo

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.

23/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Lovely, Tabo.
I wanted to make use of this special one-on-ones that I don't really get to do often. Similarly, the goal that I have for you and all your fellow Edoofians who are a part of the EWYL program is to earn Scholarship Credits so that you are on your journey of self financing your education.
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Tabo, would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 3:14 PM - +260 96 5849882: One of the things am looking forward to from the program is.
1.Good counseling from a higher class university in India. 
2. I also want to discover and learn new skills not forgetting team work

I can assure you that the plans that we have for you in the EWYL program will not only make you an equipped professional in team work but also in other 21st century skills like leadership, accountability, problem solving, content creation, etc.
23/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope you understand that this would only be possible if you show up to working on your aspirations every single day and also to making your contributions towards your EWYL program regularly. Contributions can be of any scale - big or small. However, they should always result into learnings. You can obtain those learning from your sessions with your mentor, projects, wednesday lessons, etc. I hope that you make the most of it.
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - +260 96 5849882: Loud and clear 🙏
23/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Before I end today's session, I have something exciting to share with you, Tabo

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India. They shall also connect with *visionaries, educationists, industrialists, school headmasters, principals to share learnings and collaborate in ways that benefit the learners like you! ⭐
23/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope this sounds interesting to you?
