With the New Year around the corner, we're just a few months away from having you join us here in India. 🇮🇳

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
22/1/24, 8:53 AM - Sharda Edoofa: _*Good Morning*_ ☺️
I would like to remind you that you have a session *scheduled today on the EWYL Line at 9:30am*, kindly come to the line and follow your EWYL Line ritual of saying *'I  am a proud Edoofian'*

I cannot wait to start our session!
22/1/24, 7:31 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Evening Nyikadzino!
I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits as you continue your educational journey with Edoofa. I am thrilled to share some exciting news with you – we have scheduled a new and convenient session time for tomorrow!

🌟 New Session Time: 03:00 PM CAT

But here's the real highlight – tomorrow's session won't be our usual one. I have a special treat in store for you – I will be leading the session myself! Get ready for an engaging and insightful experience as I share valuable insights, guidance, and inspiration with all of you.
I can't wait to see you there, ready to learn and grow together. Let's make tomorrow's session an unforgettable experience! 🚀 <This message was edited>
