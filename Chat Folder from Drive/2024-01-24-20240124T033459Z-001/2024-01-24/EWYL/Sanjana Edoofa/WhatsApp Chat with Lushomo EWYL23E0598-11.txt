16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be from 12:00-01:30 PM on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*MONDAY and THURSDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
17/1/24, 9:55 AM - +260 97 6560282: Good morning Saloni madam so I have to say all this
17/1/24, 10:07 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Lushomo!

17/1/24, 10:09 AM - +260 97 6560282: Mmmmm every day Saloni Madam
17/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you!

17/1/24, 10:18 AM - +260 97 6560282: ??
17/1/24, 10:19 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to is the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”
