6/1/24, 4:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 12th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 5:51 PM - +265 994 86 48 23: Wow such an incredible news madam
I'm thrilled to hear this and see how your interactions with CEO s and co founders on slice con 24

Looking forward to see the photos and the videos you will take on this special day
6/1/24, 7:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, definitely.
6/1/24, 7:52 PM - +265 994 86 48 23: I will be more frantic
Also when coming back check the form for my student pious mofolo
6/1/24, 9:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure, Lorent
15/1/24, 1:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
20/1/24, 10:54 PM - +265 994 86 48 23: Ooooh.... Madam its as if am dreaming receiving this message from you... Yet it has been already be done I'm deeply grateful at the same time heart broken when I remember how our journey was like,,,,, esteemed madam Jasmine.... You're the hope I had towards my goal but since you said the one replacing you will be the same I believe to fulfill my dreams through edoofa....

To candidly express my deepest feelings,,,, you were so incredible that I couldn't imagine... I don't know how I can express this to thank you but I personally ask the Almighty God to bless you abundantly....

I've been always telling you that you are my role model in different aspects of life mainly academic life.... It's always been my passion to become what I said as my career aspirations

This journey has been so difficult but fruitful... We're coming from afar but you kept encouraging me not to give up but to focus on my dreams through Edoofa...

Iam who lam today just because of your mentorship of which I can't take it for granted

Let me me use the same opportunity to ask to do the same to other people wherever you go.... You will see achieving greatest successes...


I'm deeply sorry to loose you as my mentor and this Is not exciting but for your own goodness and for you to achieve your goals and dreams as well I may say... Go and work

Had it been people appeals for their mentors to continue wherever they stopped after they are done with what they are doing lwould be one of the persons to appeal

Furthermore its my wish and dream that even if you are going there but the moment I will reach there in India this coming August try to find sometime and visit me... I will be very grateful and I admit

Eventually wishing you success as you are going to the next greatest step... Work hard as well because I will be very happy seeing you with that PhD chemistry paper..

When you find some free time try to get in touch with me I beg🙏
22/1/24, 8:04 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Lorent

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.

23/1/24, 1:36 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Lorent
I am doing well, thank you for asking. I hope the same with you.
23/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Lorent, it is unfortunate that you are experiencing power outages. However, this session was particularly scheduled today so that I can share a few upcoming updates with you. In the light of this, let me see and arrange a short session with somebody from the mentorship team who could do the same with you.

I hope that is alright?
23/1/24, 1:50 PM - +265 994 86 48 23: Yes madam else we should just wait for a few minutes from now... Will that going to be possible?
23/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Sure, how long do you suggest that would be?
23/1/24, 4:39 PM - +265 994 86 48 23: For now it can work madam
