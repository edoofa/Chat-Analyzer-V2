29/12/23, 2:10 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Exciting news! With the new year approaching (and guess what, it's our session day!), But don't worry, I have got it all covered. *I have rescheduled that session to Wednesday (3rd jan'2024) at 9:30 am* 🌟 

With the New Year around the corner, we're just a few months away from having you join us here in India. 🇮🇳
 Hence, let's make these sessions our top priority. They're like golden tickets to more scholarship credits and supercharged college prep! 🚀 Your dedication is the secret sauce to our success! 🎓✨
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Charmaine
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
15/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sharda Edoofa: kindly excuse the basic confusion - *the session is scheduled with you at the usual time which is from 12:00PM.* Please be available at the scheduled time.
15/1/24, 11:51 AM - +27 79 069 2506: Greetings
It's unfortunate that we will not be carrying on with the scholarship die to some problems
15/1/24, 11:52 AM - +27 79 069 2506: We are looking forward to our refund as you promised
15/1/24, 3:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Charmaine
I am sorry to hear that. 

Before we move ahead with any decision, can you please let me the exact challenges you are facing? Also, have you informed your admissions team regarding the same?
15/1/24, 4:02 PM - +27 79 069 2506: Financial problems
15/1/24, 4:02 PM - +27 79 069 2506: Which Admission team are you talking about
15/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sharda Edoofa: You must be communicating with your admissions officer on the Admission Group. They are your admissions team.
22/1/24, 12:05 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon*
I would like to remind you that you have a session *scheduled today on the EWYL Line at 1:30pm*, kindly come to the line and follow your EWYL Line ritual of saying *'I am a proud Edoofian'*

*I am waiting on the EWYL Line.*
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Kindly note the updated time - It is 12:00PM.* Hence, the session have already started. Kindly come to the line right now.
22/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Charmaine 

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *3:00 pm to 6:30 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
23/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good afternoon, Charmaine, how are you doing today? <This message was edited>
