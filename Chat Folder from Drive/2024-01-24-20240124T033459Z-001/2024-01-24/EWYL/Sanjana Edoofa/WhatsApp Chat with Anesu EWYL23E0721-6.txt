Goodnight!
6/1/24, 4:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 12th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 11:19 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky understood
15/1/24, 1:25 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
17/1/24, 9:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

22/1/24, 8:19 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Anesu

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *3:00 pm to 4:30 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky l will be there
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Good afternoon

23/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 125 6089: I'm oky how are you
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I am doing fine, Anesu. Thank you for asking.
23/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope we are ready to start today's session?
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes I'm ready
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Lovely, Anesu.
 I was having a conversation with Ms. Jasmine earlier today and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 125 6089: I would like to earn more credits and reduce my financial burden so that l can carry on learning
23/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is wonderful, Anesu
I actually wanted to make use of this special one-on-ones that I don't really get to do often. Similarly, the goal that I have for you and all your fellow Edoofians who are a part of the EWYL program is to earn Scholarship Credits. May I know your progess in the projects that you have been given?
23/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 78 125 6089: I'm still working on the applications
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is perfectly fine, Anesu. As of now I am only concerned about your regular inputs that you have been making. I hope you understand that the projects are very carefully crafted to not only ensure that you earn credits but to foster marketable skills like leadership, accountability, content creation, etc. 

You must and should approach your projects as practical applications to your learnings. Having said that, there are other projects like African School Reforms, that would help you in the areas of collaboration, public speaking, etc.

I hope that you are on the same page?
23/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
