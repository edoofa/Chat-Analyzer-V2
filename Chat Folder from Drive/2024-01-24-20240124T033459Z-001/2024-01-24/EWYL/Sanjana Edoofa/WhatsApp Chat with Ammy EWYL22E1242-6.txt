How are you?
28/12/23, 11:08 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, you have done an excellent job!
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
28/12/23, 11:11 AM - +263 71 941 0618: I will
