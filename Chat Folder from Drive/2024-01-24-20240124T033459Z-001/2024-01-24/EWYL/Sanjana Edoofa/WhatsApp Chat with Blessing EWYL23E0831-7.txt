29/12/23, 4:32 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *3:00 pm to 4:30 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.

23/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Wonderful, Blessing!
Tashinga, I was having a conversation with Ms. Saloni earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 857 7395: The EWYL has not been forthcoming lately due to challenges to do with time slots.
23/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 78 857 7395: My expectations was to start on projects that will enable me to earn points and be able to pay my fees without giving much burden to my parents when l go to university
23/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 78 857 7395: EWYL also helps me to innovative and gain some work experience due to different projects to be done.
23/1/24, 3:53 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Oh, that is unfortunate to know, Blessing. Would you mind sharing more so that I can discuss with the mentorship team to find a solution for you?
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 78 857 7395: I go to school Monday to Friday from 8am up to 3pm so l will be offline because phones are not allowed at school. So my slots were put at 1.30 to 2.30pm of which l won't be available.
23/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 857 7395: We then asked for the time to be changed to anytime after 3 pm but to no avail so we couldn't do the sessions most of the times.
23/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 78 857 7395: I hope my plight will be considered this year.
23/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Sure, Blessing. I appreciate your intent and willingness towards the EWYL program. I assure you that I will have this discussed on priority and solve this for you.

My goal as the Head of the Program is not just to ensure that you actively participate in the sessions and succeed there but also ensure that you do not have to take the heat for inconvenience.
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: This in fact is very re-assuring for me.
I wanted to make use of this special one-on-ones that I don't really get to do often. Similarly, the goal that I have for you and all your fellow Edoofians who are a part of the EWYL program is to earn Scholarship Credits.

 May I know your progess in the projects that you have been given?
23/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 857 7395: It's still work in progress and l hope to finish them this year.
23/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 78 857 7395: Balancing my school work load and projects has been a challenge for me last year but l hope this year will be much better
23/1/24, 4:36 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I understand, Blessing. Students do find their schedules and commitments extremely difficult. However, I hope that you make the most use of the guidance from your school teachers, headmasters, your EWYL mentors, your parents to seek help and figure out a plan for yourself.
23/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 244 4639: Noted thanks
23/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 244 4639: I will try my level best to assist him where possible.
23/1/24, 4:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That is wonderful, Blessing. Your efforts do count.
On similar lines, I had a discussion with your admissions team and was made aware that you are mid way through your journey of coming to India by completing some part of your registration formalities. How are you and your family feeling about that?
23/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 78 857 7395: We are really excited as a family and hoping everything will go very well
23/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 78 857 7395: I can't wait to come to India.
23/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Excellent, Blessing!
