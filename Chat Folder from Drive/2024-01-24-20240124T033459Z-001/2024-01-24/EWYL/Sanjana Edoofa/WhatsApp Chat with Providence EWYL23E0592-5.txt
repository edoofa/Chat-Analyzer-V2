Christmas is a special time of year that bring family together.its a time to make memories that will last a lifetime. People all around the world celebrate this holiday in different ways. 

Every year , l decorate my home with beautiful Christmas tree, and l hang lights and ornaments around the house


I always attend church services and reflect on true meaning of Christmas. 

For me , it's a special time to remember what's important in life.one thing l love the most about Christmas is the spirit of giving seeing people's faces light up when they receive a gift is one of the most wonderful things in the world. 

The true meaning of Christmas is about giving from the heart, and that's what makes it so magical 


#Merry Christmas 🎄🎁and a blissful New year ✨✨

31/12/23, 5:40 PM - +263 78 511 0068: In the upcoming year 2024 
I have set several goals for myself. In terms of academics, l plan to maintain a high a high grade point average. I plan to develop a study schedule that allows me to effectively balance my course work and outside commitments. In addition, l plan to take courses that challenge me and help me grow as a student and a person 

In terms of personal development, reading is an important part of my goal to broaden my perspective and learn new things. I also plan to practice mindfulness and meditation on daily basis. I have heard that these practices can help reduce stress , improve focus , and promote overall well-being. I think this will be beneficial to me as a student, and l believe it will help me stay calm and focused during busy and stressful times. 

I have identified several organisations that are doing meaningful work in my community and that align with my personal interests. I plan to contact these organisations and see what opportunities are available for me to get involved.  I believe that volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and to make positive impact on others. I also think it will be a rewarding and fulfilling experience for me personally. 

One thing l will do is create a daily schedule that incorporates time for studying, reading, volunteering and other activities. I will also set smaller goals within each larger goal , so that l can track my progress and stay motivated. I will also stop spending time with the wrong people 

That's how l plan to accomplish these goals in 2024

Have a blissful New year✨🥳

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 511 0068: Wow that's great news to hear,  l wish l could have been a part of the event
6/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 511 0068: Saturday Activity 

Last month, l  had the opportunity to attend a three-day conference on Leadership and Management. The conference was held at a resort and it was an amazing experience. 

There were several different speakers, each with their own unique perspective on leadership and management. The first day focused on the importance of communication and teamwork, while the second day focused on setting goals and creating a vision for success. 

The third day was all about implementing change and overcoming obstacles. Each day was packed with informative sessions, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities. 

Overall, the conference was incredibly valuable and l learned a lot from it. I gained a better understanding of how to be an effective leader, how to create a positive work environment, and how to motivate and inspire others.The networking opportunities were also really beneficial, as l was able to meet and connect with other professionals from a variety of industries.

In addition to the conference sessions, the resort was beautiful and the food was delicious. I highly recommend this conference to anyone who is interested in learning more about leadership and management. 

One session that really stood out to me was on ''Emotional Intelligence" and Leadership. The speaker Dr Marry Smith , discussed the importance of emotional Intelligence in leadership and how it can help you build trust , motivate others , and create a positive work environment. 

She shared several practical strategies for developing emotional Intelligence, such as active listening, empathy, and self-awareness. I found her insights to be really thought-provoking and helpful. It was truly an unforgettable experience.

Providence, I was actually having a conversation with Ms. Sharda earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
