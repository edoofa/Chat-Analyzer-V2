Thank you for asking

23/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I had a wonderful experience with Ms Saloni. She is a great mentor. She taught me how to connect with different people in various communities. She taught me the soft skills to use when communicating with school heads or Principals in the African Schools Project. She was always there to help when I faced challenges. Not for forgetting the Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activities , she explained them to me and helped to mould the person I am today
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Well, this is wonderful and reassuring, Praise. I wanted to make use of this opportunity to check in and understand to see if you are ready for all that we have planned for you in the EWYL program ahead - not only to ensure that you gain enough industrial exposure but also to earn scholarship credits.

I hope that you are ready to consistently give your 100% moving forward?

Praise, I was having a conversation with Ms. Saloni earlier and she walked me through your progress in your EWYL sessions lately. Would you mind walking me through your expectations that you have from the program ahead and how is it that you wish to fulfil them by through the help from the mentorship team?
23/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 980 7849: My expectations are gaining new skills, expanding my network and  finding new opportunities.
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: That sounds great, Praise. I hope you understand that this would only be possible if you show up to working on your aspirations every single day and also to making your contributions towards your EWYL program regularly. Contributions can be of any scale - big or small. However, they should always result into learnings. You can obtain those learning from your sessions with your mentor, projects, wednesday lessons, etc. I hope that you make the most of it.
23/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I will
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same.
