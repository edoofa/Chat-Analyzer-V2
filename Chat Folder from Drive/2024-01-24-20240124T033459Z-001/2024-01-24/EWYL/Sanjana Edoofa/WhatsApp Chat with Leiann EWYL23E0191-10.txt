3. *How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person* 
I got the school head's number through my A level biology teacher. We discussed about what Edoofa is all about inorder for him to have a clear understanding.
4/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Thursday to everyone,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
4/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, I am so proud and happy to see this🥳🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes maam
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you very much

4/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes maam l will
4/1/24, 10:16 AM - Saloni Edoofa: What about other Heads?
4/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 719 3568: They have read my messages but did not reply

12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 719 3568: That is well noted maam
12/1/24, 10:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, do let me know.
12/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes l have done it
16/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Leiann!
How are you?

This week we will be having our session on *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Project updates
Since we don’t have the Saturday activity to be discussed for our session today, I want you to come with any concerns you have to work on the Community Building project and the African School project in our session today. I want us to start accelerating our performance so that we can utilize the time to give our utmost on working on the projects.

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.
