6/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Nosisa
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
22/1/24, 8:10 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good evening, Nosisa

I am thrilled to share with you that a very special opportunity awaits you tomorrow. I have managed to schedule a special one on one session with the *Program Head Ms Sanjana.* The session would be held from *1:30 pm to 3 pm CAT*. This is one opportunity I do not wish for you to miss, so do ensure you are online and prepared with your questions on time!!

The time slot has been very carefully decided, keeping in mind the fact that most students are usually available during their lunch breaks or after school.
22/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok ma'am
22/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I will be there
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Happy to share my results with you
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Good afternoon
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Nosisa
How are you doing today?
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I am fine
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Glad to know, Nosisa
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I was just going through your result. I am happy to see your grades!
Congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: How did your family react to this, Nosisa?
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 035 0406: They were so excited
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Very well! You should be proud of yourself, Nosisa
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Indeed
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Nosisa, I was actually having a discussion with Ms. Sharda earlier about your performance in the EWYL Program. We walked through your entire performance and I see a lot of positive intent and willingness towards your higher education.
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Why don't you share with me the expectations that you have from the EWYL program further and how is it that you plan to utilize your mentor in the same?
23/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok , the EWYL program is good
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Because it can help to reduce ones fees
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I would like to work with my mentor hand in gloove even at my arrival there
23/1/24, 2:29 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I appreciate your clarity of purpose here, Nosisa. Our goal and feeling is mutual. I would absolutely want you to be consistent in your sessions with the EWYL team and ensure that you are working on the projects that have been assigned to you.

On the same lines, why don't you walk me through your progress that you have made until now?
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 035 0406: No. Progress yet
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 035 0406: But I promise soon
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Sure, Nosisa. That is alright. However, please understand that the most important aim that I have for my students is to ensure that they earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits so that they can self finance their education moving forward.
The aim would only be a wish if actions do not justify the aspirations that one might carry. Hence, I would want you to carefully focus on working on the projects regularly to achieve outcomes.
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope that you understand?
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you
23/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Lovely, I would be closely monitoring your performance.
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam
23/1/24, 3:03 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: On similar lines, I had a discussion with your admissions team and was made aware that you are mid way through your journey of coming to India by completing some part of your registration formalities. Congratulations! How are you and your family feeling about that?
23/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Happy
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same. 

I wanted to personally share with you that in the upcoming weeks, we shall have the most esteemed members of Team Edoofa visiting various countries all over Africa, with the sole aim to connect with and inspire students such as yourself, and to guide them on their quest to build meaningful careers and await you on your journey to India. They shall also connect with *visionaries, educationists, industrialists, school headmasters, principals to share learnings and collaborate in ways that benefit the learners like you!* ⭐
23/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope this sounds interesting to you?
23/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes it does
23/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Nosisa. With such little time that awaits you towards your arrival in India, I hope that you are all geared up.
23/1/24, 5:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: It was truly wonderful speaking to you today. It is now time to conclude the session. I am glad that I got an opportunity to connect with you today, and look forward to having more such sessions wherein I can gain more insight into your experiences of being a Proud Edoofian! Take care of yourself, work hard, the sky is the limit! 

Do ensure you stay connected with the EWYL Team to know your schedule further. Have a great day ahead!
