20/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 3504: The second one will do fine ma'am. Thank you.
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you ma'am, I'm really looking forward to starting the discussions.

23/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am, I'm good thanks and how are you?
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yess, we may begin. 👍🏽
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I do not.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Ohh, okay. I'm grateful to have them on my side.
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, it's very intriguing ma'am.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, let me get right on it.
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm done reading ma'am.
23/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

Have a great day ahead! See you soon!
