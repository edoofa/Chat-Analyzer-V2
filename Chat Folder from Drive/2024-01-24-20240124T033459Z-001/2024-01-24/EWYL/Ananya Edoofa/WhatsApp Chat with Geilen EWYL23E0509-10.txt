26/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was so excited to talk to you about the Christmas celebrations, however, you did not show up! May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 977 5405: How are you doing mentor
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I have observed that you have not been consistent and punctual in attending your sessions. As your mentor, I am concerned about your progress, and I would like you to discuss with me if you are facing any challenges. How will we learn and earn credits if you do not attend the sessions on time?
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Currently I am on my way to Mutare.. Coming from our farm where I have been facing network issues
27/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You have been inconsistent since 12th of December, Geilen!
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Pardon for that... Sorry for not staying in touch.. I was away and couldn't have access to my usual communication channels
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok mentor... The venture is looking for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA, eager to extend their assistance in the overall development of all the students that enroll for EDOOFA programme
There are factors I should take into consideration and these include nature of company, financial stability, background and founder etc...
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Afternoon mentor..
28/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Geilen, why are you late today?
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 977 5405: In our region we are facing heavy rains that is causing network issues
28/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Geilen! I understand. Many of my students have been complaining about the rain.
28/12/23, 4:56 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Yes.. Till the 31st of December
29/12/23, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session time is over, I am including our session for today.

As our session concludes, and we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024 and we will resume from 2 January onwards🎉

2/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen !

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Mine was great... I hope yours was filled with joy and prosperity
2/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Gelien, why are you late?
2/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 977 5405: I'm very sorry I was late for our session. I was attending a church service, and it ran longer than I expected. I understand that my tardiness was inconvenient, and I apologize for any trouble it caused. I would like to suggest that we reschedule our session for a different time, as I will not be available for the next 7 days because the prayers start in the morning from 4 to 6 am, then afternoon session from 12to 2 pm and then the last session at 4 to 6 pm. I hope you can understand and that we can work out a solution that is convenient for both of us. Thank you for your understanding.
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, shall we connect at 8:30 a.m. in the morning?
2/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Thank you so much for understanding and for rescheduling our session. I really appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me. I look forward to meeting with you at the 8.30 tomorrow. Thank you again for being so understanding....

 Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
12/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 977 5405: What a fascinating fact! I didn't know that. It really puts things in perspective, doesn't it? It's amazing to think about the vast variety of life on our planet, from tiny ants to enormous whales. It really is a reminder of how small we are in the grand scheme of things. I wonder if there are other species out there that we haven't even discovered yet! 🐞🦠🦖
12/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok mentor
12/1/24, 9:07 PM - +263 77 220 3591: <Media omitted>

August 2024 or August 2025
15/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is the application form, that can be used to shaer among the students!
15/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Will come back to you as soon as possible

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
16/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Good morning
16/1/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Yes I am ready..
16/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
16/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok go ahead
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

16/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok noted
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
16/1/24, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Geilen, I am still waiting for you to resume our journey together!
22/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Geilen, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 12:00 p.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together, see you tomorrow! 🚀 <This message was edited>

I understand that you'll be busy in the coming weeks, and the new session time sounds good to me. Can't wait to hear more about the amazing experiences you and your students will have! 😊
