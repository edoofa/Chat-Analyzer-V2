5/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
5/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 947 7813: With that I feel like I know you already

5/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Same to you.
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Fitzgerald!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 8:01 PM - +263 71 505 4041: thats great have a good time
8/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Hello Ms.Ananya. I am ready for the session
11/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your end, however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!
11/1/24, 7:38 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I am glad to have you back. My apologies for not being available today. We are experiencing load shading due to the heavy rains.
12/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Good afternoon
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Fitzgerald!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Haha, that's incredible.
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Not really. What are they?
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is good to know?
12/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
12/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Indeed it does
12/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀

15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, due to a technical glitch, I cannot access our last conversation. Could you please share a screenshot with me so that I can move forward?
15/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 947 7813: <Media omitted>

15/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
15/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Indeed it does.
15/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
15/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
15/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is alright. Thank you

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
