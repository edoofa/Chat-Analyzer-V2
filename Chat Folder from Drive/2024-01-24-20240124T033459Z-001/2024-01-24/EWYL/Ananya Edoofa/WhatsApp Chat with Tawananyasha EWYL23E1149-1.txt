Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Waal ... that is powerful ..good afternoon,  Ms Ananya
Iam Mrs Mushambi...Tawananyasha's mum.  Tawananyasha is still at  school.
22/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263776298068 

Thank you for informing me. However, I hope you remember that you have signed a document to complete your orientation with me to proceed in a smooth manner.

If she is occupied, I would recommend that you should attend her orientation session on her behalf.
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Very true
22/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, shall we connect tomorrow at 1:30 pm?
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 629 8068: How about today  ..can't we start since iam available
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Please go ahead and explain everything to me
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tawananyasha* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 629 8068: First goal noted
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Second goal noted as well
22/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 629 8068: This is good
22/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time! <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Very well then
Be blessed
23/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Good afternoon 
Very well thank you and how are you
23/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 629 8068: How are you Ms Sanjana the *Head*of the Department* ...and Ms Davi, *Head Coach*... I'm Mrs Mushambi  *Tawananyasha's mum*
Mean while Tawananyasha is still at school
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: She is currently in a meeting, @263776298068
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes it sounds so interesting
23/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, you can read it later!
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound,?
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Good
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Very clear
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.
