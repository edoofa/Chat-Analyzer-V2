I hope you are doing well. As we embark on our first session of 2024, I'm eager to catch up and dive into our exciting plans for the year ahead, especially considering your arrival in India. C'mon, join your EWYL Line for your session!

23/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Delight, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
