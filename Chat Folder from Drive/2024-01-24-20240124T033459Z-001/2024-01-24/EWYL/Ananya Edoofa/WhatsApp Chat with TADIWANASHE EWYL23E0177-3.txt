15/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now let us conclude our session with a motivating quote : 

_Remember, every step forward counts, no matter how small. Embrace the challenges, for they are the stepping stones to success. Keep pushing, stay positive, and watch your journey unfold. You've got this!_🚀
15/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 815 2807: Thank you
15/1/24, 7:32 PM - +263 77 508 8556: Noted with thanks
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 815 2807: 😂😂😂Afternoon
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us begin our session by discussing the two objectives!
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe

22/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 815 2807: How are you doing
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwanashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 815 2807: Yes I'm ready
23/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one and a half hours. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 1:30 p.m. in the morning.
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 815 2807: Noted
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

Have a great day ahead! See you soon!
