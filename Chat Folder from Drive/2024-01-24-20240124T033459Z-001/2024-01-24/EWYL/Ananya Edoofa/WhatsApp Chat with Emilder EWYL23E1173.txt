*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am so ready ma'am.
22/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions? <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Born and bred in the third capital city of Zimbabwe, Gweru as the third and youngest in a family of three girls, my name is Emilder Nyasha Makura. I am 18 years old. I recently sat for my final high school exams (Advanced Level) with Thornhill High School in which I passed with an A(5 points) in Heritage Studies, a B(4 points) in Literature in English and an E(1 point) in Geography. I studied both my O Level and A Level at Thornhill High School in Gweru, Zimbabwe. My hobbies are fashion designing, reading novels and writing short stories. I also like cooking. I loved playing sports at school, it was a wonderful work out routine. I belong to a nuclear family; my parents and 2 older sisters. My older sisters are both studying for their masters degrees. My father works for a co-operate called Montana Carswell Meats. My mother is an entrepreneur. My goal is to study law and go on to open my own firm one day. I also want to get a master's degree before I turn 30 and get a 6 figure salary annually before I am 30 too.
22/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, it's awesome to learn more about you! 🌟

Fashion designing, novel reading, short story writing, AND cooking? You've got quite the range of talents!
22/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Living in a nuclear family with two ambitious sisters, a corporate dad, and an entrepreneurial mom - it sounds like a dynamic household! Best of luck with your goal to study law and open your own firm. That's some serious ambition, and I'm rooting for you to hit those milestones before 30! 💪 Keep shining, Emilder! 🌈✨
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Well I also like photography, can I show you some of the pictures I have taken?
22/1/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Definitely, Emilder! I am so excited!🚀
22/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you Ms Ananya😊my family really motivates me to be the better version of myself everytime, they have set a great example for me.
22/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You are lucky to have a family like this, Emilder! 

We will together make them proud!🤝🏽

22/1/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 289 6783: My parents joined the group also. I will let them introduce themselves.
22/1/24, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Hello Ananya ,I m Listen Makura , Emilder's mother
22/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mrs Makura! How are you doing?
22/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 353 2574: I m fine and you

22/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I wish we could connect for some more time; however, since our session time is over, let's reconvene in our next session, which is tomorrow at the same time.

It was so nice meeting and connecting with you all. See you next time!🌸
22/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 364 2468: That's great. We thank you all for the great job. This is very encouraging
22/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Okay ma'am, thank you so much for your time and dedication. Have a great day! Talk soon Ms Ananya!
22/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Thank you ma'am
22/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 364 2468: Thank you all. Good day.
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Good morning ma'am.
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emilder!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am I am.
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am I understand
23/1/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 289 6783: It's a wonderful pleasure to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi.
23/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Very interesting ma'am
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you, let me go through it.
23/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 289 6783: I am done reading ma'am
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 78 289 6783: The second paragraph from 3 questions for you was most inspiring for me!
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Since our session time is over, I want you to read the document and share your understanding with me before our next session, which is tomorrow.

I hope to see you tomorrow! Have a good day!
23/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am it is
23/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 289 6783: Thank you ma'am. Have an amazing day! Talk soon!
23/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 353 2574: Thank you ma'am
