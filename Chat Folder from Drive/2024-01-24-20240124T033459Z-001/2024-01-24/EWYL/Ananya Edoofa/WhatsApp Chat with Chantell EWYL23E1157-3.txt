Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 294 4709: We are herr
22/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
22/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Well I finished my A levels and I love reading novels as a hobby and I wud like to be a lawyer
22/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's fantastic! Congratulations on completing your A levels. It's wonderful that you enjoy reading novels as a hobby. Pursuing a career as a lawyer sounds like a compelling and exciting path. Best of luck on your journey!
22/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Thank you
22/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 441 5087: @263771205513 
This is my mom
@263772944709
And this is my dad
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 441 5087: No
22/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

23/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chantell!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
23/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Noted
23/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yep
23/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Wow
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 441 5087: The 3 quotes and the edoofa hall of inspiration
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

Have a great day ahead! See you soon!
23/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Was following have a great day
