2/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Not yet, please explain <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Understood
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you to both Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana  for their dedication
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes it does
2/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I have read them
2/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 714 6734: 🤣
3/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kabongwe! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Its a quite a tricky one..... 
Good Day... Apologies for mot being available had a challenge with electricity, it was off hence i had no battery

How are you doing today? Shall we begin our session?
4/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes we can begin
4/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kabongwe, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
4/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Think sounds great, after all it is key to have relevant skills that will help me navigate my professional journey
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes its clear, let me get started
4/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. I am so happy about your consistency. Maintain this, and I promise that we will excel in this program!
4/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
4/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary of this document. 

Due to the sudden shift in the economy that came with COVID pandemic one has to be aware of the jobs that are to be on demand in the future as well as be able to acquire the skills for the futures jobs on the market. 

On the same note about acquiring skills one has to be aware that, there're emerging skills and enduring skills. 

Emerging skills examples are data analysis, social media literacy,  online\digital skills and literary, remote teamwork and creative content writing. 

Enduting skills are empathy, risk taking, decision making, business development and relationship building. 

There are 3 projects i will be involved in, that will help me develop the skills mentioned above. 

Project 1.
Cooperate Alliances. 
In this active, I will have to Identify companies eg FinTechs, companies that deal in digital payments etc, identify decision makers in that company, reach out to companies, (this usually via LinkedIn as it is a professional tool), arranging for a call\video call between the  Edoofa team and client and finally facilitating the contract signing. Further one has to make an excel sheet that acts as a progress report. 

Project 2.
Community Building
In this project one has to cultivate persuasion, negotiation and negotiating skills. 

One has to recruit students to be part of Edoofa, by filling applications,  reaching out and sharing about Edoofa, completing these also reaulta in earning scholarship credits. 

Project 3
African Schools Education Reforming Mission

This is where the students links Edoofa with local schools in pursuit of technologically reforming schools. 

This is the summary i got.
5/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kabongwe!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼

Thank you
5/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well done, Kabongwe!
5/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
5/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, will do so
5/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I have listened to the Audio... I hear the advice
5/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
5/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 714 6734: The person on the audio was explaining project one, which is cooperate alliance. He explained that with his help we would create a LinkedIn profile which will help me reach out to the target audience which are people in the tech industry, i would set up a meeting and help facilitate the meet such that the Edoofa team will tale over and explain better the project. Also this will help me gain the needed skills for the market ahead after graduation
5/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Kubongwe. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

5/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kabongwe!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
11/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kabongwe!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

Step 8, start reaching to the company, it is preferred to reach out to various heads in the company than directly to the founders

18/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
18/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok ok I'm following
18/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok please do
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.

Q2. Good Day, my name is Kabongwe Sibanda, a former student of your in the class of U6 2016. I recently got an opportunity to study abroad through the Edoofa program and i would like to share the same opportunity with other fellow student from the school. May i know if this is something you will be interested in, so that i connect you to the team at large who will better explain the program. 

Q3. My school is located in Mat South
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Understood. Unfortunately i have lost contact with the school as it has been years. But i will try
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I will do so, but I'm not in contact with anyone but i will do so
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes let me get to it
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Since, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 714 6734: May i know that the only EWYL projects i get to are these 3 only? I'm in a science field and there's the practical side to it, may i know if they're projects that relate to that specifically? Because in as much as i need to learn how deal with world around me, i need that industrial knowledge
22/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, will do.
22/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I'm sorry may you record again, there's background noise that makes it unclear
