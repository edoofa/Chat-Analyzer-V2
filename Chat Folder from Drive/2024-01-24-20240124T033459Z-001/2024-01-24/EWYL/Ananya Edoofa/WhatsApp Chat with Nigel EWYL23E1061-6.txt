5/1/24, 6:39 PM - +263 71 226 7257: *Dear Mentor, my name is Nigel Tinodaishe Marowa, and my EWYL group name is Nigel EWYL23E1061. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (12-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*

12/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nigel!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Iam fine how are you this morning
12/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing good.
12/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?

12/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 226 7257: I don't have a specific genre l like all genre
12/1/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 71 226 7257: No l don't
12/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok
12/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok thats amazing
12/1/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok take care
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nigel!

Hwoa re you doing today? I'm excited to share that we have beautifully decorated the walls of our office gallery! The space now reflects creativity and inspiration. I am so excited to add our photo here as well!🚀🤝🏽
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Oooh thats amazing
15/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Nigel?
15/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Iam sorry l was a little busy with something but now lam now available
15/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes it does
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/1/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok thats amazing

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Good morning to you too
16/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 71 226 7257: 😅😅
16/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 226 7257: I just really liked the story of Grace Manzou it really motivated me alot
16/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes it is
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
16/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 71 226 7257: It sounds amazing
16/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

23/1/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
23/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

23/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok so can l create it now
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
23/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
