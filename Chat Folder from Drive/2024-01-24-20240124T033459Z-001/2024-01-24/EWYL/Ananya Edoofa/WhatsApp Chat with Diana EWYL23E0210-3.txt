The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?

5/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Diana!

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.
16/1/24, 12:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Diana!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 77 924 5194: Good afternoon ma'am ,l have sent my daily message ,it is network issues only
23/1/24, 11:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Diana, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 924 5194: I have been waiting to hear about this ma'am that's great news , I'll wait for your updates thank you so much
