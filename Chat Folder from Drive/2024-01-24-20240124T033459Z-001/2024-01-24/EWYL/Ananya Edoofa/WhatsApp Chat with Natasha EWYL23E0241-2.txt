12/1/24, 12:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natasha!

I know we missed our session on Tuesday, but I'm back from the event and I'm really excited to catch up with you! Let's connect on our EWYL line to discuss everything!
16/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natasha!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
23/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Natasha, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
