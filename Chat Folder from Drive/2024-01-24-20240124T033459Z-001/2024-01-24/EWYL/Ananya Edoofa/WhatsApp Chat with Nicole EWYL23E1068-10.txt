Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM

27/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 968 8377: I can not wait

27/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 968 8377: This is so amazing thank you for providing me with this. I am truly humbled.
27/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 71 968 8377: Well l enjoy reading a lot, I'm always reading a book during my free time. I am a person who enjoys their solitary a lot. I aspire to become one of the best software engineers in the world making a huge impact to humanity.
27/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session earlier. However, since our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time.
27/12/23, 5:00 PM - +263 71 968 8377: It is okay, yes we can continue tomorrow. Have a good day.
28/12/23, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Good morning Ms Ananya
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, That's awesome! Reading is such a great way to unwind. What kind of books do you usually go for? And aiming to be one of the best software engineers? That's some serious ambition!
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I am looking forward to a victorious day
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Every morning before my day begins l read inspirational life-changing books such as Atomic Habits, Can't hurt me.
28/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It truly is.
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Then throughout the day l enjoy some fantasy, romance, or thriller books
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 8377: No, I do not please enlighten me.
28/12/23, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/12/23, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you, l am now fully aware of the objectives and am thrilled by them.
28/12/23, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It is such a pleasure to be acquainted by them too. Nice to meet you all. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/12/23, 8:53 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It really does.
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:05 AM - +263 71 968 8377: This is very eye-opening and l am truly inspired by Nyasha's story.
28/12/23, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It is so comforting and l am excited to embark on this.
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:18 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Yes, let me go through it
28/12/23, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟
28/12/23, 9:27 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you l certainly will do so. I am looking forward to it too.
28/12/23, 10:14 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Should l start with the Corporate Alliances Project?
29/12/23, 8:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole!

*Welcome to your last session of 2023!*

Let's make it exciting—reflect on your journey this year and share your aspirations for the next. What dreams do you want to chase in 2024?
29/12/23, 8:33 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Good morning Ms Ananya. I hope you are doing well.
29/12/23, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, Nicole! What about you?
29/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I want to maintain a good healthy and fit life.
I would want to start a program that will help the less privileged especially the kids in Orphanages.
I aspire to be one of the best students in my class for next year. 
I would also want to continue with my journey of finding myself.
29/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I am good thank you.
29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am happy to hear about your positive approach toward the coming new year! 🌟🚀
29/12/23, 8:46 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you.
29/12/23, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, Nicole did you get a chance to read the above document? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 8:49 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Yes, l did.
29/12/23, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
29/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 71 968 8377: On the document, I understood that the EWYL will ensure that l am aware of how businesses are changing and learning with the times and this will not be efficient alone I also need to acquire skills and these are the enduring skills. We have emerging enduring skills and these include creative content writing, online literacy. And the enduring skills that have always been there include decision making skills, empathy and being a risk taker.
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - +263 71 968 8377: These  points will ensure l am ready for my future work life.
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Okay let me listen to it
29/12/23, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/12/23, 9:16 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I have learned that l need to understand the market I will be in in the future and start preparing for it at an early stage. The work has moved to online networking and l have a great chance to be in touch with companies that are technologically driven. I would start creating a LinkedIn account and this platform that l could use to get in touch with companies as well as the employers. I will get to talk to a lot of managers, executives and HRs. Connecting with such people will help me explore and expand my network and this will help me in work life experiences and even help in obtaining a job and my country and this would be beneficial to myself as well as my country.
29/12/23, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing,Nicole I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/12/23, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Okay let me read it.
29/12/23, 9:27 AM - +263 71 968 8377: The Guide for Searching Companies:

I need to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to help in the overall development of all the students under the Edoofa program.
I must consider these 4 points 
1. The nature of the company 
2. The scale of the company 
3. Financial stability 
4. Background of Founder
29/12/23, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session concludes, and we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024 and we will resume from 2 January onwards🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
29/12/23, 9:32 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you so much.
29/12/23, 9:33 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you same to you.

2/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It was great thank you, how was yours?
2/1/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It was amazing! Now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
2/1/24, 8:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

2/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 71 968 8377: This is great news.
2/1/24, 8:56 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Should l start working on the project now?
2/1/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well,we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
2/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I have taken note of that, thank you for informing me.
They sound pretty interesting.
2/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Nicole, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
2/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Okay, l am on it.
2/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 968 8377: On the Community Building project l approach my friends and family looking for students who are willing to and serious about studying abroad.  I share my experience with the Edoofa program and how it is very beneficial. If they are truly interested and serious about it, l share with them an application form in which they fill up their details and l then share it to the group. I can only send a maximum of 10 applications a week.
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome,, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
2/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you.
2/1/24, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
2/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 71 968 8377: This is very motivating.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Please do.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you for sharing this, l have clearly understood.
2/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
2/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

3/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I am Nicole Ruvimbo Nyamandiyo, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

6/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nicole!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 71 968 8377: Hello Ms.Ananya, lt is alright,  we can reconnect then.
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 968 8377: Wow, this is such great news. I am glad that you had such a lovely experience. I hope I will also experience such.

23/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Nicole, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Wow that's such great news.
23/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Okay
