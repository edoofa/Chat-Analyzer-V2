7/1/24, 8:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝Good evening!

When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

23/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Silibaziso, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
