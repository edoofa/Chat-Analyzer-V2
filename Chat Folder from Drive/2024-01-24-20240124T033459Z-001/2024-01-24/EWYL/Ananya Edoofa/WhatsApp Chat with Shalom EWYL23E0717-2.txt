The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?

Sorry just saw your message 

I have network issues due to load shedding this side

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

I hope you are doing well. As we embark on our first session of 2024, I'm eager to catch up and dive into our exciting plans for the year ahead, especially considering your arrival in India. C'mon, join your EWYL Line for your session!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!

23/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Shalom, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
