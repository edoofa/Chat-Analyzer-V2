Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 626 6679: I am hoping so too
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Yolanda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 626 6679: I plan to graduate with honours and pursue a degree in Engineering an EWYL program will make this process affordable and impact me with skills beneficial in all aspects of my life
18/1/24, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is splendid, you have expressed yourself so well🌟
18/1/24, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 626 6679: No I don't
18/1/24, 4:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Good afternoon
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Friday everyone, 
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Yes we may
19/1/24, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/1/24, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Okay I now have a clear understanding of the two goals
19/1/24, 2:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 626 6679: I have gone through it and it actually inspired me
19/1/24, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to listen to this🌟
19/1/24, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Greetings Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *01:30-02:30 PM*.
