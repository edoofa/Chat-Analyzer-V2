How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

We will discuss all this in our session on *Monday and Thursday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Saturday Activity
2. Project updates
(I hope you remember our weekly targets: Either you have to share _5 forms for Community Building projects per week_ OR _1 form for African School Reform project per week_)

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.

How are you?
29/12/23, 1:32 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

How are you?

I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.
