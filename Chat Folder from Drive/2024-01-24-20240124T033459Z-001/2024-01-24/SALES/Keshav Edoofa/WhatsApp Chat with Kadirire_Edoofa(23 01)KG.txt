23/01/24, 12:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about Edoofa scholarship program to you
23/01/24, 12:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 12:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 12:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

23/01/24, 12:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
23/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 091 4676: OK this is good news
So I need a scholarship, I have got a single parent my mom who is not capable of taking me for University, my uncles have been paying up for my studies up to Form 6 and I did well in my advanced level studies, so I saw Edoofa as an excellent opportunity for me to persue and archive my dreams, I would greatly appreciate the help that you are ready to offer
Thank you.
23/01/24, 1:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Nyasha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
23/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 091 4676: OK thank you once again, let me also take this opportunity to introduce to you about my aunt who we also have on this platform Mrs Kadirire the wife to my uncle Mr Kadirire.
So I will start by indicating that I am a child with a single parent as I had said earlier, I don't know my father since I was born. I grew up with my grandparents since I was a little child as my mother was not responsible enough to take care of me so she could not offer any help to me financially or emotionally as she is an alcoholic and she can not even fend for herself , so my uncles and aunties assisted me by paying for my education from primary level up to high school.
So I did my A level at St matthias tsonzo High school with my uncle and aunties offering help, so now I have finished my A level and I still want to go further with my studies but the challenges im facing right now are that my uncles can no longer pay for my university studies as they also have their families to look after that's why I decided to look for assistance at Edoofa.
So I was thinking if I can get a better scholarship I would I want to study agronomy as a I did biology, geography and crop science at my A level. I got to figure out that my strengths are in agriculture as I grew up in  a family were we do subsistence farming as a way of living and to look after ourselves. 
My hobbies are athletics and football in which I have also participated on the highest levels of high school sports and also won several medals from playing soccer and doing athletics. Thank you.
23/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
23/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 091 4676: My uncle and auntie
23/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As you mentioned in the introduction your uncle and auntie can no longer support you, can you please clarify honestly about it?
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 091 4676: It is not like they not totally offer any more help to me, but All I was trying to say is they can not pay for my full education to go for University
23/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Nyasha noted
23/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know about your term fee at St Matthias tsonzo High school?
23/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 091 4676: It was 490 USD
23/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okayy Nyasha!

23/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 091 4676: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for sharing Nyasha!
23/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
23/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay thank noted
23/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 091 4676: My pleasure.

23/01/24, 2:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 091 4676: . I would like to ask about the earn while you learn program, is it accessible to everyone?
23/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 091 4676: And also after one gets a scholarship, does it provide the flight charges and  accommodation for the student?
23/01/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Regarding the earn while you learn program we will discuss ahead in the session about it rather in the very depth
23/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost aspect is the one thing i am going to talk about next right now!
23/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay I'm listening
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Ooh this is great.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Ok noted
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Nyasha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Alright this is good news
23/01/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay
23/01/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
23/01/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

-TIA Organics
23/01/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

23/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yea this sounds a good idea, I'm sure I can also benefit from it
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 091 4676: So I think this is all I had to ask for today
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Can we proceed to the next stage.
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Nyasha, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Alright
23/01/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
23/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yes sure

23/01/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 091 4676: This is exactly what I have been looking for sure
23/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 091 4676: This is really great
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yes I am ready
23/01/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Nyasha as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay noted
23/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 091 4676: If the student apply to 5 Universities at 300 usd, he might spent around 1 500 usd
23/01/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nyasha, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay ojay
23/01/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 091 4676: So when does this fee needs to be paid
23/01/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Fee details will be clarified in detail ahead Nyasha
23/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yea for sure
23/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Sure.
23/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/01/24, 3:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Nyasha, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Okay noted
23/01/24, 3:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope your this doubt is well addressed now?
23/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yea it is
23/01/24, 4:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Nyasha, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
23/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yes I did understand
23/01/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
23/01/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Nyasha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Yes I did
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 091 4676: Oky
23/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 091 4676: So now we are waiting to move onto stage 2
