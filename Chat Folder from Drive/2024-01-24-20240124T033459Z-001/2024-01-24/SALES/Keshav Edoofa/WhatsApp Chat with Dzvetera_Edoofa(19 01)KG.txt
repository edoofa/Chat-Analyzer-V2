19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain about Edoofa scholarship program to you!
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

19/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
19/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 946 8554: Ok noted Mr
19/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 946 8554: That's Great Mr Keshav
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 946 8554: That's it Sir
19/01/24, 10:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 946 8554: Yes Mr
19/01/24, 10:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit Tadiwanashe, well done!
19/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
19/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 946 8554: Thank you Mr Keshav
19/01/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Do kindly introduce yourself Tadiwanashe

19/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you tell me what was your term fee at Mamunyadza High school?
19/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Um sorry Mr Keshav for late response network becomes a problem here
19/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Our term fee at Mamunyadza was $70. US dolla
19/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Noted Tadiwanashe
19/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
19/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Sir no one can afford to pay for tertiary level in family due to financial crisis
19/01/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then what is your family financial planning to assist you with your higher education abroad?
19/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Actually I don't know sir
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are clarified that Edoofa provides scholarships to students that range from 50-100% on their yearly university fee and does not provide any sponsorship
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me clarify further
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

22/01/24, 8:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: BSW, also termed as Bachelor of Social Work is a 3 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is BSW Course*
BSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical BSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in BSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the BSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

BSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study BSW*

-BSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.

23/01/24, 9:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Yes lets proceed
23/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 946 8554: No sir
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

23/01/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Ok
23/01/24, 1:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tadiwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 946 8554: Ok ok Mr Keshav understood
23/01/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
