19/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

19/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
19/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Wow ok
19/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes
19/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tatenda, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 088 9015: The 2nd metric might disadvantage  me hence  lm raised by a single mother and she will be at work  from  8 am to 3.30 pm
19/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is Alright Tatenda, I absolutely understand the challenges, It will be fine if she keeps a follow-up of the session once she gets back from work!
19/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tatenda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok thank you

19/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for sharing 

I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
19/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now with that I shall brief you about the course
19/01/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

19/01/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I want you to read it carefully and understand it and let me know once done!
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok 
Done
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 088 9015: I see myself  working  either for private sector or public sector for a start and as time  moves on l would love  to start my own thing were l will be applying  my skills
If l get  in the  edoofa  program , it mean so much  to me as l burden  to my parents will be reduced  and as l would  be aiming for M.com I'm  sure they will support  me with no doubt
19/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Tatenda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
19/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 088 9015: I'm  willing  to give my maximum  hard working
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 088 9015: I have always wanted  to try a new environment as l believe there are better opportunities  than  here
19/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.
Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination
19/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 088 9015: I also  believe  how other countries  are developed  making it  better to have educational  materials
19/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes right Tatenda
19/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes right 
Yeah I'm  wondering why Edoofa recommneds India
19/01/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

19/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok ok
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
19/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Wow
19/01/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead
19/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yeah l have
19/01/24, 4:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
19/01/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
19/01/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tatenda what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok 
Thank you
19/01/24, 4:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
19/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes please
19/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa added +263 78 611 2581
19/01/24, 4:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

20/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
20/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

20/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

20/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

20/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 088 9015: The EWYL  gives job skills  and as stated  that it might be before  one finishes his/her edication this will provide  a chance  for an individual  to get into the career  journey  with perfected skills 
Also this  is beneficial  as being ab Edofians means that there are guaranteed  opportunities to be recruited 
The EWYL programm could be a motive that l would want to get involved  in hence the credits can be used to pay off a significant  part of my higher education fees
20/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Wonderful clarity Tatenda, I must appreciate your understanding
20/01/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 088 9015: Thank you
20/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 088 9015: Oh  ok understood
20/01/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/01/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yeah l haven't  seen of heard about something  likr this
This  is so good
20/01/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you are able to comprehend the benefits our program provides
20/01/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes I'm ready thank you
20/01/24, 12:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Tatenda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 088 9015: 1500-2250
20/01/24, 12:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tatenda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok
20/01/24, 12:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yea l think so
20/01/24, 12:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/01/24, 12:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
20/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
20/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Ok <This message was edited>
20/01/24, 12:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Tatenda, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Oh alright
20/01/24, 12:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Tatenda and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
20/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes l have understood
20/01/24, 12:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
20/01/24, 12:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/01/24, 12:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Tatenda, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
20/01/24, 12:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Yes thank you
20/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
20/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/01/24, 12:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 088 9015: Alright
20/01/24, 12:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
Also @263786112581 if you have anything to clarify kindly do tell me!
20/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 088 9015: As of now I'm good thank you
20/01/24, 1:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
20/01/24, 1:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/01/24, 1:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT* I will also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.

From all the above counseling i am convinced that EWYL is a recognized and appreciated program which is seen as a success to many.

22/01/24, 9:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
22/01/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 088 9015: Ok done
22/01/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: What do you think about the same?
22/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 088 9015: I think it's a great chance that once someone is introduced to he/she would never want to miss. I would also want to be a proud Edoofian!
22/01/24, 9:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see last year over 1700 students and parents attended this session, So now I would like to hear from you, are your parents willing to support you to the fullest so that you can work hard and be a part of the Edoofa Program for further intake?

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 78 088 9015: Yes l am
22/01/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which tatenda would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would tatenda be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of tatenda's enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same? <This message was edited>

22/01/24, 10:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: No Tatenda it is already 1500-2300$ for you and apart from that you can reduce it even further through the EWYL program
22/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ?
a) enfeeble
b) thriving

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

*_TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?_*

 Sixteen years after the genocide in Rwanda, the country has made strides towards rebuilding and healing. However, the scars of the past are still visible, and the challenges facing the country are still significant.

Rwanda's economy has been growing steadily since the genocide, with the GDP increasing by an average of 7% per year(estimated). The country has also made progress in improving health and education, with child mortality rates dropping and more children attending school. However, poverty remains a major issue, with more than half of the population still living below the poverty line.

The social and political situation in Rwanda is also complex. The government. I can start by elaborating on the economic situation in Rwanda. As I mentioned before, the GDP has been growing steadily, but poverty remains a problem. One of the main challenges is creating jobs. The government has been working to attract foreign investment, and to develop industries like agriculture and tourism. However, the lack of skilled workers is still a major issue.

On the social front, the legacy of the genocide is still felt. Many Rwandans still live with trauma, and there are tensions between different ethnic groups. The government has been working to promote reconciliation, but it is a slow process.
As for the political situation in Rwanda, the country is considered to be a relatively stable and peaceful democracy. However, there are concerns about freedom of expression and dissent. The government has been accused of cracking down on journalists and opposition groups. Additionally, President Paul Kagame has been criticized for consolidating power and extending his term in office.

It's been 16 years since the brutal genocide in Rwanda claimed the lives of more than 800,000 people, and the scars are still visible in the country. The genocide was a dark chapter in Rwanda's history, but the country has made significant progress since then. While there is still much work to be done, the Rwandan people have shown great resilience and determination.

Rwanda has made great strides in rebuilding its economy, which suffered greatly during the genocide. The country has also made significant progress in improving its infrastructure and access to basic services. However, poverty remains a major issue, and many people are still struggling to make ends meet. The country has made great progress in reducing poverty, but more than half of the population still lives below the poverty line. Despite the challenges, the government has continued to invest in programs to improve the lives of its citizens. And there are many inspiring stories of individuals who have overcome incredible odds to find success.

"My Inspirational Story"

My name is Blessing Tatenda Mugabe. A girl  aged 18 and ever since  l heard about the Edoofa programm l was just imagining myself  being  1 of the  proud  Edofians .Making it higher  in terms of my tertiary education hence  it reduces  costs to my parents. Also this program is actually a life changing programm that one would not want to miss once  given  an opportunity.

 Absolutely! I'll tell you a story about a young woman named Blessing.Blessing was always passionate about learning, but she grew up in a poor community with limited access to education. Despite the challenges,Blessing found a way to study and learn as much as she could, and she eventually earned a scholarship to a university.

After graduating, Blessing could return to her hometown and tell others about a program called Edoofa, which stands for "education for all." Edoofa works to provide access to quality education for everyone, regardless of their financial situation. Blessing's story is a reminder that determination and resolve can lead to great things. Sure! I'll elaborate a bit more on Blessing's story and its relation to the concept of "gathering resolution from danger." Blessing faced many dangers and obstacles on her journey to achieve her goals. But each time she faced a challenge, she used it as an opportunity to grow and learn. In this way, Blessing was able to turn the "dangers" in her life into opportunities for personal growth and strength. She took control of her life and created her own path to success.Blessing grew up in a small village in Zimbabwe  without a Father figure , where access to education was limited and resources were scarce. Despite the challenges of her environment, she did everything she could to study and learn.Blessing's determination led her to earn a scholarship to a Scholarship through the Edoofa . The university gave her the opportunity to further her education and gain valuable skills. This was a life-changing moment for Blessing, and it allowed her to return to her hometown and tell others about the programme(Edoofa)
Blessing's journey from her home village until to the point were she made it to get a scholarship,this is not a true story, but it is inspired by the many real-life stories of people who have overcome great odds to achieve their goals. I think it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and everyone has their own unique set of challenges. But with determination, focus, and resilience, it is possible to overcome even the most difficult situations thus could be shortages of resources  hence most African  countries are not economically stable

It's  proof that with the Edoofa programm  you can change the world  and also  give  a hand to those in your sphere of influence  contributing towards making the world a better  place.

23/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Sure ,i can't just sit and allow myself to be her stumbling block

23/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Thank you so much sir
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You're welcome
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So Mrs. Miranda, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Very true sir family support plays a vital role
23/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Okay noted
23/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Yes i am
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Excellent Mrs. Miranda, I really admire your willingness to see your child succeed!
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 611 2581: Thank you

23/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

23/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th of January 2024 for $200 and the 28th or 29th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th of January 2024.
