You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 12:46 pm - +260 97 2580246: What is this?
18/01/24, 12:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. James I hope you are doing well
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Nalumba, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Faith, is that correct?
18/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 779950273: yes
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Faith, also do tell me whether you learnt about Faith’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 1:23 pm - +260 779950273: OK
18/01/24, 1:24 pm - +260 779950273: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very Well Nalumba, now let me further elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

18/01/24, 1:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 779950273: OK thank you very much for the opportunity
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 779950273: so do we get projects to do
18/01/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: All of it will be conveyed to you Nalumba as we proceed ahead with the counseling session
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 779950273: OK
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 779950273: on my honest opinion I think it's possible
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Nalumba!
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Nalumba, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

19/01/24, 10:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/01/24, 10:44 am - +260 779950273: yes
20/01/24, 10:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/01/24, 10:48 am - +260 779950273: for now
20/01/24, 10:48 am - +260 779950273: am good
20/01/24, 10:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/01/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/01/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/01/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/01/24, 11:04 am - +260 779950273: noted
20/01/24, 11:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Nalumba what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/01/24, 11:10 am - +260 779950273: how does the earn while you lean program work again
20/01/24, 11:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am going to explain you about the EWYL program in depth Nalumba
20/01/24, 11:11 am - +260 779950273: OK
20/01/24, 11:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

20/01/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

20/01/24, 12:07 pm - +260 779950273: The EWYL program is a great aspect because it gives people scholarship credit best on their performance which is equivalent to money . I also noticed that it has helped people develop their skills since the 21st century also Focuses on increasing broadening such as .: projects with brands and companies ,recruitment partnerships

20/01/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/01/24, 12:13 pm - +260 779950273: wow
20/01/24, 12:14 pm - +260 779950273: now I understand
20/01/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/01/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/01/24, 12:17 pm - +260 779950273: Understood
20/01/24, 12:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/01/24, 12:20 pm - +260 779950273: ready
20/01/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Nalumba as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/01/24, 12:26 pm - +260 779950273: 1,500 - 2 250 Dollars
20/01/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nalumba, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/01/24, 12:30 pm - +260 779950273: noted
20/01/24, 12:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Nalumba, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/01/24, 12:34 pm - +260 779950273: OK
20/01/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Nalumba and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
20/01/24, 12:37 pm - +260 779950273: yes
20/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
20/01/24, 12:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Nalumba, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
20/01/24, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
20/01/24, 12:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
20/01/24, 1:03 pm - +260 779950273: understood
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake
20/01/24, 1:09 pm - +260 779950273: don't  we have to wait for the results to come out first
20/01/24, 1:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you specify what kind of results you are talking about?
20/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 779950273: my grade 12 results
20/01/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You can enroll in our program Nalumba and can start with your EWYL program and begin to earn scholarship credits which will help you to reduce your university fee even before your A level results gets out!
20/01/24, 1:16 pm - +260 779950273: ok
20/01/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
Also @260972580246 @260973694778 if you have anything to clarify kindly do tell me!
20/01/24, 1:18 pm - +260 779950273: no question
20/01/24, 1:18 pm - +260 779950273: understood
20/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
20/01/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
