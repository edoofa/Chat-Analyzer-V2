18/01/24, 12:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Trish!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Tatenda.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Thank you so much Mr Keshav for your response. I'm happy to discuss my application with you and answer any questions you may have
18/01/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Trish,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Okay
18/01/24, 1:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Trish, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Tatenda  told me that he is a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. He have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

After realising this thats when he  started looking for scholarship and he was found  eligible  with Edoofa scholarship program.
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great to know about your understanding but let me further elaborate!
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
18/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 031 1610: I'm very impressed by the Edoofa Scholarship Program and its focus on skill development through real-time projects. It's wonderful to see an organization like Edoofa that is so committed to improving the quality of education and providing students with employability skills. I'm very interested in learning more about the program and the ways that it is impacting students and their future careers.
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Trish!
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Tatenda also gave me this insight about Edoofa, and l understand now that it is a scholarship program initiated by  Anhad Edutrain Solutions. INDIA ...Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Trish, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing clarity i must say Trish, Kudos!
18/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes I do
18/01/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sorry for the delay, I was a bit occupied 
shall we continue?
18/01/24, 3:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Trish!
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes we can
18/01/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Trish, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
18/01/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Sorry for the delay ,I'll reply you soon
18/01/24, 4:44 pm - +263 78 031 1610: I'm excited to be a part of the Edoofa student community! I'd be happy to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm from Zimbabwe, and I've done A level  and want to persue an Accounting degree. Accounting is fascinating to me because it's like a puzzle that needs to be solved. I enjoy the challenge of putting together the pieces of financial information to create a complete picture. I also enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing a complex project and seeing the results of my work. I'm also interested in the way that accounting can help businesses and organizations run more efficiently and make better decisions. For me, it's not just about numbers; it's about helping people and businesses succeed.My interest in accounting combines with my attention to detail, which allows me to spot discrepancies in financial statements and make sure that all of the numbers add up. I find it very rewarding to find those little mistakes and fix them before they become big problems. I live with both my parents and am their first born ,we're three children in my family, and my parents work in  two different fields . My mom is teacher,a primary teacher and my dad is a Salesman at a Beverage company
18/01/24, 4:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Trish, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

19/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 031 1610: My parents were able to help me financially through my studies up to form 4, but  due to work problems at my A level, they could not afford my fees so they got me registered for the BEAM program, and I am interested in pursuing higher education abroad. Even my parents want the same thing but they want to get to know the fees you offer and if they will be able to afford
19/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile I understand the challenges Trish let me assure you as your counselor, I am here to help you and guide you with utmost efforts for you to secure maximum scholarship under our Edoofa program, <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 031 1610: I  believe that accounting is a stable and reliable career path, and I am excited to learn more about the field and become a skilled Chartered accountant

I am motivated by the idea of having a career that is both stable and rewarding, and I believe that I have the determination and dedication to succeed in this field.
19/01/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 031 1610: I believe that studying abroad will give me a unique and valuable experience that I can't get by staying in my home country. I'm looking forward to expanding my horizons and gaining new perspectives that will help me grow as a person and as a professional.
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?
19/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes I do wonder
19/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

19/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes Sir ,am available for now  you may continue
19/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
19/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Nothing for now ,but am sure my parents will have questions but for now they're busy at work . As soon as they're free ,they'll join us
19/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Trish let them know the details we have covered so far and you can ask me their doubts and clarifications on their behalf
19/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
19/01/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Trish , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes we can Sir
20/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Trish what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 031 1610: Thank you ,I understand Mr Keshav and I know that studying abroad is a significant financial investment. However, I believe that this is a worthwhile investment in my future, and I am confident that the scholarship program and the Earn While You Learn Program will help to reduce the financial burden for my family. I appreciate your support and understanding as I pursue this opportunity. 
I've been discussing this with parents and they truly want me to get this opportunity,but they're not sure if they'll manage even the little amount you'll be willing to offer us for start.
20/01/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please tell me the financial planning of your family regarding the higher education abroad?
20/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 031 1610: We're still in the process of figuring out my financial plan. I will get back to you as soon as we've figured out something
20/01/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

22/01/24, 9:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood this well?
22/01/24, 9:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
22/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes Sir
22/01/24, 9:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
22/01/24, 9:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

22/01/24, 9:16 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

23/01/24, 9:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Trish, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes Sir we may start
23/01/24, 9:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Please answer to this Trish! <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 031 1610: Mr Keshav l'm confident that the EWYL Program will provide me with the necessary tools and resources to be successful in my chosen career path. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience, develop my networking skills, and build relationships with industry professionals. I believe this program will give me a competitive edge in the job market and help me achieve my goals. And by havingsaid that I actually thought my parents were going to answer this too and because they're the ones who l look up to in this decision of doing the EWYL Program.
23/01/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Trish, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 031 1610: Oh ,that's really beneficial and this  EWYL Program is very useful
23/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 031 1610: Thank you for sharing your experience and expertise! I really appreciate your insights and the time you took to explain the benefits of the EWYL Program. It's clear that consistency and hard work can really pay off for students who are committed to the program. I'm feeling more motivated than ever to get started and make the most of this opportunity,I'd love to learn more about the program and hear more success stories
23/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Trish, I absolutely resonate with your thoughts!
23/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes
23/01/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Trish as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 031 1610: The application process for one university is already expensive, and if a student has to apply to five universities, they're looking at an investment of $1,500-$2,250.That's a lot of money to spend without any guarantee of admission or financial aid. No wonder students often feel so stressed during the application process
23/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Trish, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350*
23/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 031 1610: Wow,That's really incredible
23/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 031 1610: Edoofa is making it much more accessible for students to participate in the program. It's very inspiring! 😊
23/01/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 031 1610: Absolutely! Edoofa is really simplifying the entire process for students who are applying to universities abroad like me. There's so much involved in applying to universities and getting a scholarship, and Edoofa is helping students manage all of that with one flat fee. This is really impressive, and I imagine it's quite a relief for students to have such a supportive program to guide them through the process.
23/01/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/01/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Trish, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 031 1610: Thank you Mr Keshav and  l very much understand all these processes, I'll be discussing this with my parents today
23/01/24, 11:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Trish, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
23/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 031 1610: Yes Sir I've understood that very well indeed ,,,my apologies for the late response  ,got a little busy
23/01/24, 11:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
23/01/24, 11:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Trish, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/01/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/01/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are You available to continue @263780311610
23/01/24, 4:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
23/01/24, 8:36 pm - +263 77 619 3926: How are you Mr Keshav. Frankly I was following every conversation you were conducting with our daughter Trish.A normal and honest person surely cannot fail to acknowledge every detail that you have been presenting so well and clear and understandably superb. It illustrates that your Edoofa program is amongst the best offers found globally and anyone in a good position cannot hesitate to recommend your organization to someone.
However sir, it was our wish to allow Trish to be broad in her search for a  University place either locally or abroad. As you know every child especially in our continent quickly prefer to try new arenas which is not bad of a choice in this generation.Edoofa attracted Trish so much through colleagues like Tatenda. We as parents thought to consider for her hence our effort to at least hear more and know more about you. Honestly Mr Keshav we as Trish's parents for now our financial position have no depth. We may try to practice stubborn faith on that but uum we have realised that we cannot afford this. $350 on it's own for application alone is a mountain to climb to us.

This does not nullify your Edoofa as a very exquisite program it is still amazing to find people like you who patiently accommodate people like us in the way you have been doing. Welldone in deed you do as if doing unto the Lord God bless you.
