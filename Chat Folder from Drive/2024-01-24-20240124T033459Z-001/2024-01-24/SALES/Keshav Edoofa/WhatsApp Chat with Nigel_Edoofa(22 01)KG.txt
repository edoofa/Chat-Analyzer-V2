*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Abraham.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
22/01/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
23/01/24, 9:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Nigel, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
