15/01/24, 9:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall proceed ahead with explaining about Edoofa program to you
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

You can go through our Global Education Summit hosted at Dominican Convent School, Harare on 28th May and at UCE, Bulawayo on the 2nd of June*

15/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 236 7502: noted
15/01/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

16/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Givemore, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/01/24, 8:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Obey and Mr.Givermore, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
18/01/24, 8:48 am - +263 77 236 7502: Whats the way forward for the kid to get a place ...Currently will be busy soo give us the way forward or send the requirements
18/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Mr. Givemore, in that case we can proceed ahead with the session
18/01/24, 8:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please tell, by when Obey will be available for the session?
18/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 78 653 6126: 👋
18/01/24, 9:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Obey!
18/01/24, 9:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Obey, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 653 6126: Not yet
18/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I please know the reasons behind it?

18/01/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 653 6126: You welcome
18/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 653 6126: There are many reasons why I would like to study computer engineering abroad rather than in my home country. First, I believe that studying in a foreign country will expose me to different cultures and perspectives, which will enrich my learning experience.

18/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Third, I believe that a degree from a foreign university will be more respected and recognized in the global job market. And finally, I'm excited about the opportunity to travel and explore new places lol.
18/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.
18/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
18/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Something like that
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Yeah
18/01/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

18/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay okay
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Will do so
18/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Right now i dont have enough connectivity
18/01/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Obey
18/01/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now Obey, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
18/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 653 6126: I have understood everything for the meantime
18/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Have nothing to ask
18/01/24, 1:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very well then, I hope Mr. Givemore and Mrs. Lucia are also following up with the session, parents involvement is very important for their child counseling!
18/01/24, 1:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 653 6126: They do yeah
18/01/24, 1:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Please go ahead and tell me the same
18/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 653 6126: The cost of studying abroad, even without a scholarship, can be significantly higher than the cost of studying in India. In fact, the average cost of a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in India is lower while the average cost of a similar degree in the United States is much more than India’s
18/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Have I answered the question correctly
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Superb Obey , I must tell you , you have great knowledge but I would like to clarify this aspect even further to you and your family
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay okay
18/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Obey, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Ohkay
18/01/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
Or now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
18/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Yeah do that
18/01/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
18/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 78 653 6126: On it
18/01/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

18/01/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
18/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

18/01/24, 2:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 2:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 653 6126: I completely agree that these webinars can be really beneficial for students and can help them to be more successful in their careers. By gaining insight into how their lives might look after graduation, they can make informed decisions about their future and take the necessary steps to achieve their goals.
18/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Additionally, the ability to turn any situation into an opportunity is a valuable skill that can be used in any field. So, I think these webinars could definitely benefit me. It's important to be aware of the opportunities that exist and to have the knowledge and skills to take advantage of them.
18/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sorry for the delay, I was a bit occupied 
shall we continue?
18/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is wonderful Obey!
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Thanks
18/01/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Obey, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
18/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/01/24, 3:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/01/24, 4:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Obey, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

20/01/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. <This message was edited>
22/01/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Obey , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/01/24, 9:02 am - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
22/01/24, 9:02 am - +263 78 653 6126: Morning
22/01/24, 9:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: May i know the reason why you were unavailable for the past few days?
22/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 653 6126: Network
22/01/24, 9:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Obey, I can understand the challenges, Now shall we continue?
22/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 653 6126: Yah
22/01/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understand the EWYL program very clearly?
If you want to ask me anything regarding the same, please do
22/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 653 6126: I do
22/01/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
22/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Obey as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/01/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well , I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 9:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 653 6126: Hi
23/01/24, 9:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Obey should we continue?
23/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 653 6126: Yeah cool
23/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: You didnt answer to this Obey?
23/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 653 6126: Based on the information you've provided, the student would likely spend between $1,500 and $2,250 on the application process for 5 universities. This is assuming that each university charges an average application fee of $300-$450, and requires a statement of purpose and letter of recommendation. However, it's worth noting that some universities may offer application fee waivers, or have lower application fees. And, some universities may not require a letter ofSo, the exact cost will depend on the specific requirements of each university.
23/01/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Obey, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 10:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350*
23/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 653 6126: Okay
23/01/24, 11:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 653 6126: I do
23/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 653 6126: Yeah
23/01/24, 12:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 12:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/01/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Obey as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Okay okay
23/01/24, 12:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Obey and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
23/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 653 6126: Yeah i do
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Trish, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 4:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available to continue @263786536126
23/01/24, 4:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
