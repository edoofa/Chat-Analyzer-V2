12/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

12/01/24, 2:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *With immense pleasure,let me share glimpses of our Africa Visit of May- June 2023 where our Founders were welcomed by Educationists, Edoofians and parents from different African Nations, especially in Zimbabwe. You can go through our Global Education Summit hosted at Dominican Convent School, Harare on 28th May and at UCE, Bulawayo on the 2nd of June*
12/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Noted
12/01/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Cynthia!
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Cynthia, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes I am positive that I have what it takes to meet the two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing Cynthia! I believe this is the spirit I look for in the students whom I counsel and I have seen that such students get the maximum scholarship in our Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Cynthia, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 913 3018: I'm very hardworking and determined , I'm not shy to ask questions if I feel left behind , I believe I can be a great leader amongst my peers due to my past experiences at school as I was a prefect , my strengths are in field work as I enjoy participating in hands on projects this also comes as an advantage in some cases since I'm an athlete .I am a fast learner and can tackle any sport

As for my background, I was raised by grandmother as my parents were working in South Africa to support me and my sister . My father is a bar tender in South Africa and my mother came back to take care of us and opened  her own canteen in Zimbabwe and I'm currently living with her

My father and mother do not earn much that can help me further my education that is why I'm desperate to get a scholarship
12/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Cynthia. Your determination to excel in your studies is truly commendable and reflects a strong sense of responsibility toward securing a bright future for yourself and your family. 
As your counselor, I will guide you and support you at every step of your counseling session and we will both work towards you getting the maximum scholarship under our Edoofa scholarship program
12/01/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please some shed light on your school term fees at Nkululeko High School?

Also who supported your tertiary education and who will support you financially for your higher education?
12/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 913 3018: As I started form one and two I had a sports scholarship that covered for two years and that covered my school fees. At form three the school fees was 100USD and 250RTGs and I as wrote Alevel it was paid in USD and the amount was $410

My mother will support me financially for my higher education
12/01/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia thank you for sharing
12/01/24, 3:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know more about your siblings? <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 913 3018: I have an older sister the and age of 22 she is studying hotel management and tourism and she's graduating this Year
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Cynthia, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You! <This message was edited>

15/01/24, 9:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
15/01/24, 9:02 am - +263 77 710 4915: Good morning to you too
15/01/24, 9:03 am - +263 78 913 3018: Morning
15/01/24, 9:03 am - +263 78 913 3018: Yes let's proceed
15/01/24, 9:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during going through your application form you mentioned you would like to study Law, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
15/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 913 3018: Well in most of my life I've come not notice that not everyone always gets justice or enough help when in trouble or fighting over a case and the problem is due to ignorance or they might be financially incapable to get the assistance they need.

So if I were to get a chance in this study I'll educate people mostly on abiding by the correct norms and represent the voiceless if oppressed
15/01/24, 9:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is very thoughtful of you Cynthia
15/01/24, 9:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
15/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 913 3018: No. I would be the first one
15/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia
15/01/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
15/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 710 4915: Following
15/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 913 3018: Yes , I'm very curious indeed
15/01/24, 9:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

15/01/24, 9:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great
15/01/24, 9:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now Cynthia, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 913 3018: No ,I am satisfied with the information on the quality of higher education Edoofa has to offee
15/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 913 3018: *offer
15/01/24, 9:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia!
15/01/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or Mrs. Mildred are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 913 3018: No, I'm afraid we need knowledge on that too
15/01/24, 10:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia, as your counselor I am here to support you and guide you in getting the maximum scholarship in our program and tell you every neccesary information in detail
15/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 10:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 710 4915: Noted
15/01/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Cynthia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Noted
15/01/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
or shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes please brief me on that
15/01/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Cynthia
15/01/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 12:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 12:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

15/01/24, 12:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since I will be getting up for my lunch break , we shall continue with session after sometime
We shall meet at 1:00 PM CAT
15/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Noted
15/01/24, 1:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with our session now?
15/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes
15/01/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Cynthia, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Wow that would be a great advantage for any student
15/01/24, 1:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Cynthia!
15/01/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Mrs. Mildred I am very glad you are keeping up with the session!
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 913 3018: It is  and it promising
15/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Right Cynthia
15/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

15/01/24, 1:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Cynthia, by now I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.


They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country. What are your thoughts regarding the same Cynthia?
15/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes it is very true , I myself fear facing the same fate as I have witnessed how difficult it comes after getting their degrees
15/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thats where Edoofa plays it part Cynthia, let me explain
15/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
15/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 913 3018: The fourth point as it assist the students to make better choices as they would be guided by someone with adequate knowledge so as to avoid wrong decision
15/01/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Cynthia!
15/01/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

May I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 913 3018: Yes we have discussed international education but we were not sure on the costs of living , the tuition fees, food and accommodation
And the requirements for one to be accepted

18/01/24, 8:43 am - +263 77 710 4915: Good morning Sir.
Thank you so much for the  opportunity, i have been following up with the sessions and so far I'm impressed with the kind of services offered
18/01/24, 8:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great to know, we want to help and support the students with the utmost efforts!
18/01/24, 8:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 8:51 am - +263 78 913 3018: Yes
18/01/24, 8:51 am - +263 77 710 4915: Following
18/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Cynthia as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/01/24, 8:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you tell me the answer to the question Cynthia in your opinion?
18/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 78 913 3018: Student will end up spending  about $1500 and at most $2250
18/01/24, 9:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Cynthia, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 9:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 9:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 78 913 3018: Does  it mean I have to pay the fee $350 before 31 January 2024 
?
18/01/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Cynthia Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
18/01/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Cynthia, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 913 3018: Noted
18/01/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 913 3018: That will be is assistance for a student
18/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Cynthia!
18/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa try to assist our students in best way possible
18/01/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
18/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 913 3018: Yes..... hopefully my mom manages everything within the required time
18/01/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Cynthia, Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
18/01/24, 10:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: I Understand your concerns, you can anytime share your challenges with me and I will assist you with helpful solutions
18/01/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/01/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 913 3018: Olkae... noted
18/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 913 3018: Okay. So which stage are we on at the moment
18/01/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
18/01/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 913 3018: Olkae noted
18/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 913 3018: Yes sir
18/01/24, 10:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/01/24, 10:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
18/01/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/01/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

18/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Mrs. Mildred
18/01/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
18/01/24, 10:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

After the civil war and genocide. The 1994 genocide destroyed Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded the country's ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy. Political space in Rwanda remains closed. Opposition parties face administrative obstacles to registration and political pressure to toe the government line. Over a dozen political opposition members are in prison. In many cases, they are being prosecuted or have been convicted on spurious grounds.Some research into traumatic memories evolved after the Holocaust are mental health professionals who treated Holocaust survivors identified a variety of symptoms among their patients, such as anxiety , depression since they were traumatised as well as guilt, changes in memory and concentration. In conclusion Rwanda is still evolving as we look into life in a Rwandan village typically revolves around agriculture, community, and family. Many people in rural areas of Rwanda earn a living through subsistence farming, growing crops such as maize, beans, and bananas for their own consumption and to sell in local markets.

22/01/24, 1:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Cynthia While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?

22/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 710 4915: Yes, I'm ready sir

22/01/24, 3:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/01/24, 3:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/01/24, 3:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
