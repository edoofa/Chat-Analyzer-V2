12/01/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: So we must continue with your application then

Alright, so Anold, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, is that correct?
12/01/24, 8:34 am - +263 77 283 7739: Yes that is correct
12/01/24, 8:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great
12/01/24, 8:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, also do tell me whether you learnt about Isheanesu’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/01/24, 8:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: Isheanesu introduced me to the Edoofa program right. He told how he had undergone several counseling sessions and then interviews to dertemine whether he was well deserving of a scholarship.He also incouraged me to do the same and emphasized how easy the procedure was
12/01/24, 8:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Well, thats great to know Anold!

Indeed our procedure is easy to follow provided you and your parents connect and follow me throughout the session!
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now let me brief you further about Edoofa and our Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 8:44 am - +263 77 283 7739: We will try our best to follow throughout
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
12/01/24, 8:47 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thats a tough road
12/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 283 7739: That is great
12/01/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 283 7739: That is absolutely correct
12/01/24, 8:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Don't worry I am here to guide you through your counseling session and make sure you secure your scholarship seat in our Edoofa Program
12/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much
12/01/24, 8:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Anold
12/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Anold, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 77 283 7739: I think i will play my part and try as best i can
12/01/24, 8:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing to know that Anold
12/01/24, 8:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Anold, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 283 7739: My name is Anold Chipato, i do not have a middle name that is. I completed my Grade 7 in 2017 at Lewisam primary school with 6 units out of a minimum of 5.
12/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 283 7739: I then completed my Olevel at St Francis of Assisi in 2021 with 7 A's and 6 B's and i continued to Alevel. I returned to Assisi for my Alevel which i recently just completed and still waiting for the results
12/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 283 7739: To my own perspective, i am an average student who prefers a challenge to everything. This therefore pushed me to dream higher than most. I hope to study Astronomy or at the least Astrophysics and aeronautics
12/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 283 7739: I am a fast learner given a persistent teacher. I am self driven and motivated. I have a high self esteem and belief in myself.I think those are some of my strengths.
For my weaknesses, i am  slow at acting and i prefer a more subtle approach to things. I am a very short person and that has led to me hating being looked down upon, which may cause me to outburst in very intense situations.
12/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 283 7739: I have many hobbies. I could spend the whole day telling you about them so I'll just have to generalise. I love sporting activities as a hobby. Things that keep me active and fit all the time. I play hockey, volleyball, cricket, basketball, tennis and i am also a great swimmer. This would pose a weird definition of character since i like active sports as well as non active practises too. I love playong chess and i am an artist, give me a pencil and paper and i could portray you in 30 minutes. I also love singing, i was a part of the school choir and this has been a beautiful experience
12/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 283 7739: My family background is not that pleasant. It would seem exagerated from your point of view, but this is the truth. My family is a low income earning family and all that my parents work for is immediately transfered to tuitions and school fees for me and my other  3 siblings. This will then mean that there is usually no surplus to cater for clothing, even the food is sometimes scarce but my parents work extra hard to provide food and transport costs. We live in a small cramped up space wher we fit the little that we have and share the two room as best we can. We all have a hope that education is going to be our salvation someday somehow.
12/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 283 7739: Both my parents are cuvil servants and they work at Government institutions. My father works at the University of Zimbabwe as a chef and my mother works at my previous primary school Lewisam Primary.
12/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 283 7739: Their field of work is basically the education sector of Zimbabwe i think, since they both work at educational institutions
12/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 283 7739: I think thats it.
12/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Anold. Your determination to excel in your studies is truly commendable and reflects a strong sense of responsibility toward securing a bright future for yourself and your family. Your commitment to academic success is not only a testament to your personal growth but also a source of inspiration for those around you. By prioritizing education, you are actively shaping a path toward a prosperous future, showcasing resilience and a forward-looking mindset. Your efforts to uplift your family through education are both noble and impactful, and they resonate with the values of hard work and dedication! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
12/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am also amazed by your hobbies and extracurricular talent
12/01/24, 9:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: As you mentioned you have 3 siblings, can you shed some more light on what they do ?
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much for that
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 283 7739: I do what makes me feel happy
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 283 7739: Though i have previously indicated that my parents struggle in their fields of work, they don not tolerate any disruptions to their children's education.
12/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 283 7739: My elder brother, Absolom is currently pursuing a course in Telecommunication at a college called Telone centre for learning.
12/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 283 7739: Due to the high tuotion and fees requirements, my younger siblings have been forced to attend affordable local day schools in order to complete their education
12/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 283 7739: My brother, Gabriel who is 15 is learning at Southlea high school and is doing his form 3
12/01/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mr Albert and Mrs Thabitha are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and their dedication to your well-being is truly admirable!
12/01/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Francis High School* charges you every term, and who in your family has financially supported your education till now, and who is going to support your higher education?
12/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 283 7739: At the same time my sister, Abigail is attending the ame school as Gabriel, that is Southlea high school and she just recently finished her grade 7 and is doing her form 1
12/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 283 7739: St Francis os Assisi charged an average of about US$400 every term. Despite the odds my parents were still the only ones who funded me through this period. They will continue to fund me in my tertiary education if i fail to acquire a scholarship
12/01/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Duly Noted Anold
12/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is really amazing to know about your parents being behind you and supporting you in your education throughout these years
12/01/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: We both will work throughout this session towards getting you a scholarship in our Edoofa program
12/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much. The scholarship will remove a great load on parents' shoulders
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: As you mentioned you would like to study Aerospace engineering I would like to know what motivated you to pursue this course for your higher education?
12/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: Ever since i was a young child, i was very fond of the stars. I always wanted to explore deep into space and learn more about nebuli and the cosmos. " If only i were Elin Musk," i would think to myself. I thought it was impossible, but i then decided never to give up. I have ever since grown fond of the adventure the galaxies had in store for me.
12/01/24, 10:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: That are some awsome thoughts Anold , I am very pleased to know about your dreams and never giving up attitude!

So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
12/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 283 7739: No, noone has pursued that field before.
12/01/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Oliver
12/01/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: So have you researched about the aerospace engineering course and why it will be suitable to you?
12/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 283 7739: I have researched about it. Its not very wise of me i presume, but it has not been a question of why it is suitable for me, but it has always been about doing the things i love the most and earning from those things.
12/01/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: I can understand Anold, you are very determined to achieve your goals and here I am absolutely standing with you to help you achieve them!
12/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much
12/01/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering*?

12/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you Anold for sharing your results
12/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
12/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its okay anold
12/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 283 7739: That's reassuring
12/01/24, 11:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you now please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 283 7739: There are a couple of reasons. First of all Zimbabwe is not quite well known for its adequate practical approach to learning and that demotivated me. Furthermore, the universities in Zimbabwe have a limited and sometimes no admissions for courses in my field of interest.
12/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 283 7739: The other reason is just that i want exposure the world outside of Zimbabwe since i could work there in the near future
12/01/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I appreciate your insights Anold, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
12/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 283 7739: I agree
12/01/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Anold
12/01/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
12/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Yes. I actually thought of that before
12/01/24, 12:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright I will be clarifying on that
12/01/24, 12:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

13/01/24, 9:06 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Anold
13/01/24, 9:07 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Admission at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating your responses in the counseling session with your counselor.

There was an emergency because of which Mr Keshav is a bit occupied
13/01/24, 9:07 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Is it fine if we proceed ahead as of now please?
13/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 283 7739: Fine thanks. We can proceed. Only a bit of network challenges here.
13/01/24, 9:20 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright so Anold, yesterday I believe you must have learnt a lot about the Education System of India,, can you now tell me in 100 to 150 words each:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?
2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
13/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 283 7739: 1.Basically India has proved its great strength in the practical studies of medicine amongst other fields of learning. This has actually convinced me that India will be the perfect country for me to advance my education. I expect it will broaden my research, analysis, and presentation skills through its learning processes. If i study in India it is guaranteed that i would get to learn about different cultures and societies of the world which will develop me personally. My study in India will surely impact me in a positive way through acquiring a well recognised and reputable degree will would help me secure my own job in the future.
13/01/24, 9:37 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Excellent Anold, what about your answer 2?
13/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: Still working on it
13/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 283 7739: 2.Through the study of my desired career field in India, i would be able to open a new view and perspective to life of my own.Firstly through the learning and acquiring of new life skills i would be able to grow in ways that lead toward my future aspirations and goals. By attending a well reputable university in India, i hope i would be able to work around my weaknesses and improve my strengths through associating with new and career driven people. Learning in India will also help me accertain the idea of being the top of the rankings due to my learning at a good university in the country. After i finish my four year study in India, i am sure i can be able to apply for a job in any country around the world with certainty that i would be considered due to the country's good reputation.
13/01/24, 9:58 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Amazing Anold, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
13/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 283 7739: No we have no idea how much it costs
13/01/24, 10:15 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
13/01/24, 10:15 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/01/24, 10:15 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/01/24, 10:15 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 283 7739: I understand, but i have one question
13/01/24, 10:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Yes Anold, go ahead?
13/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 283 7739: I wanted to ask how, if it is possible, i can acquire a 100% scholarship since the remaining amounts you showed me are still hard for my family to muster up.
13/01/24, 10:45 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Anold, let me help you have a clarity please, in simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 283 7739: Well clarified. Thank you
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So now Anold, would you like to ask anything else?
13/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 283 7739: I dont have much to ask. If my parents give me a nod i will be greatful.
13/01/24, 11:57 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Well Anold, If I may ask why do you feel your parents might have a challenge in agreeing to this?
13/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 283 7739: I am interacting with them throughout this process. They are giving me signals in every aspect especially the financial part.
13/01/24, 12:09 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so what is their view regarding the financial part if I may ask Anold?
13/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 283 7739: My father is telling me that he may not afford any bill above us$600 per semester. He also pays for my 2 young brother and sister at secondary
13/01/24, 12:20 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I can totally understand Anold, and you see, during my stay in Zimbabwe from March to June 2023, I gained valuable insights. Many Zimbabwean students, including those I interacted with and those who shared their experiences, highlighted the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $3000-$4000 annually.

While the cost of education remains within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

During my visit, I encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, they shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I understand the harsh realities they face.

Here are a few pictures of my interactions with students and their parents during my time there.

13/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Thats a tru reflection of the costs here. I have consulted my father and he is saying us$ 1000 to 1500 per annum is true for higher education here

16/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 283 7739: Yes. We may proceed
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Anold, the other day you were sharing about how challenging it might be for your father to cater for the entire fee after scholarship, do you recall our discussion please?
16/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 283 7739: Yes sir. That is his only limitation at the moment.
16/01/24, 10:59 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Anold, are you aware about the Earn While You Learn Program please?
16/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 283 7739: Yes. I heard about it from your posts sir.
16/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 283 7739: The only issue i am failing to convince my father is the % amount earned from that arrangement
16/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 283 7739: Otherwise in terms of work i am a hard worker in various fields if afforded a chance.
16/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 283 7739: I want to persuade my father to support my dreams.
16/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 283 7739: I am now happy that our A level results came out this week

Chemistry.       B
16/01/24, 12:15 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me help you have a clarity over here Anold, You see, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 283 7739: I understand.So can i enter college with an outstanding amount which i would thereby pay off with the EWYL program
16/01/24, 12:26 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
16/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you for that
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>

16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:36 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 283 7739: I think my field is a little bit different, but after viewing the webinars, i am sure i can benefit from the program
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I am delighted to hear that Anold, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 283 7739: So i am not forced to have paid the full tuition at the beginning of the semester?
16/01/24, 1:08 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263772837739, the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
16/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Ok. Thanks
16/01/24, 1:16 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So now what all would you like to ask please?
16/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Its the father. Let me respond on financial issues. I can afford monthly instalments of not more than  us$150
16/01/24, 1:19 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So now @263772837739 doesn't the process becomes affordable overall in the first place?
16/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Say my son gets that scholarship. Can you please do the permutations for me using practical fee levels at the moment
16/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 283 7739: What i am worried about is to have a situation whereby my son gets stranded at any given time for non payment of fees.
16/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Ia a civil servant and my current net salary after tax is us$250. This a tru picture for you sir.
16/01/24, 1:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263772837739 i do understand your situation and while I am here to actively help you plan better for your child's journey ahead, I feel you would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 1:37 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 283 7739: This is truely remarkable

16/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Sorry. That was meant for another person
16/01/24, 2:05 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Oh alright please!
18/01/24, 8:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Anold , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/01/24, 8:38 am - +263 77 283 7739: Fine. Thanks. Its ok
18/01/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 283 7739: I am currently online Mr Keshav.
18/01/24, 8:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Anold, before proceeding ahead is there anything you or Mr. Albert and Mrs. Thabitha would like to ask?

I hope Mrs. Thabhitha @263776541722 , @263776392549 and Mr. @263772837739 have gone through the details in depth of the program that is been conveyed till now!
18/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 283 7739: @Albert: I do not have any more questions but i am waiting for your permutations relevant to my disclosed income of between us100 to 150 per month. Is that sustainable for me.
18/01/24, 9:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this and the benefits of our Edoofa scholarship with EWYL program that makes higher education for the students affordable
18/01/24, 9:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
18/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 283 7739: Ok. Well understood. Is there any possibility to have a draft proforma invoice from that side?
18/01/24, 9:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.


They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country.
18/01/24, 9:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate further on that for my understanding so i can assist you better
18/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank  you. To me as the father your program has been well elaborated.
18/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 283 7739: I mean the benefits derived from the program itself vis avis my financial capability as a guardian.
18/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 283 7739: What i am currently waiting for is something like a sample proforma invoice encompassing all additional costs
18/01/24, 11:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Mr. Albert you will be getting the same once we are done with the counselling sesssion, for right now let us proceed ahead!
18/01/24, 11:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since I will be getting up for my lunch break, we shall continue with the session after sometime
We shall meet at 12:30 PM CAT, till then you can see the video of our proud Edoofians.
18/01/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am available now, shall we continue with the session?
18/01/24, 4:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Anold, I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/01/24, 8:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Anold, Mr. Albert and Mrs. Thabitha , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
19/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Hi Anold, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
19/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 283 7739: @ albert. Sorry sir. I was not stationary at one place. Too mobile and busy. Will respond.
20/01/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Anold, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

I understand the challenges 

I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/01/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
21/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 283 7739: @albert available
21/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Monday 10.30am fine with me
22/01/24, 8:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Anold and Mr. Albert , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Sorry. l missed my schedule today. Connectivity problem
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Albert
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: shall we continue?
22/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Yes. Fine
22/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we were not connected for a few days i hope you have gone through all the details we have discussed so far and if you have anything to ask me kindly do tell me
22/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Thanks. All is understood sir. I am only waiting for the next process. Only that i have atight schedule at work
22/01/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Fine
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Albert as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Noted. Thats where my problem now comes. If there is no garantee of a place in one application, then for me basing on my current income, this will not be affordable to me.
22/01/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Albert, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/01/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/01/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well , I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you
23/01/24, 9:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/01/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Thursday at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
