23/01/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: It was nice to know you Mrs. Juliet, I hope you are in good health also i am sorry to hear about Moreblessing's father's demise
23/01/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about Edoofa scholarship program to you
23/01/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

23/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 807 7075: Ok I am happy to see this as I can see everything is ok .So I wanted to know how and when Are you going to meet each other myself and daughter.
23/01/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 807 7075: Sure sir.
23/01/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Moreblessing and Mrs. Juliet, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 807 7075: Like what idid not understand this last colunm.
23/01/24, 11:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: May i know when will Moreblessing be available to join in for the session?
23/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 807 7075: I think the best way is to give her the days and dates to come and join you also the place to meet since you now know the place she is staying.
23/01/24, 11:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*
23/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 807 7075: Ok so how are you going to meet her right now I am still looking for the school were she can go to attend lessons for A   level she is still at home waiting for that .
23/01/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: We shall wait for Moreblessing to come online so we can start the session
23/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 807 7075: Ok .
23/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 874 7789: Hy we start
23/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood this?
23/01/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Thursday at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
