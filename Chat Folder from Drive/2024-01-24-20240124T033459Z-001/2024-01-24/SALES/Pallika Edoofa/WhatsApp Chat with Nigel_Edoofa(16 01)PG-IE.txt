16/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Around $7000 - $8000
16/01/24, 5:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

16/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Yes maybe
16/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 71 312 0416: What Is the payment plan
16/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 71 312 0416: They are doubting they want to know the payment plan so they could see whether it is affordable or not because they earn 300 per month
16/01/24, 5:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding the same.
16/01/24, 5:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
16/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Earn While You Learn Program  is it?
16/01/24, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly!!

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/01/24, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/01/24, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
16/01/24, 5:21 pm - +263 71 312 0416: This is great
16/01/24, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
16/01/24, 5:24 pm - +263 71 312 0416: I will be earning a lot
16/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 71 312 0416: I will be benefiting a lot
16/01/24, 5:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:27 pm - +263 71 312 0416: EWLN is a big program as it reduces almost 75% of the fees
16/01/24, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed! It is
16/01/24, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Travel guidance
16/01/24, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

16/01/24, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/01/24, 5:40 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Maybe my parents but if I work hard I could handle it myself
16/01/24, 5:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's understandable,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 71 312 0416: They are very happy I hope curiosity won't kill them
16/01/24, 5:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
16/01/24, 5:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
16/01/24, 5:45 pm - +263 71 312 0416: No
16/01/24, 5:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/01/24, 5:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 71 312 0416: A student should pay before he /she is selected
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Yes
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
16/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 71 312 0416: May you answers please👆🏼
16/01/24, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on this?
16/01/24, 5:59 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Ok
16/01/24, 5:59 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Ok
16/01/24, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this
16/01/24, 6:02 pm - +263 71 312 0416: I was saying a student should pay for the application before selection
16/01/24, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That happens when a student applies by their own
16/01/24, 6:05 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK noted
16/01/24, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 6:08 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Eligibility check test and interview
16/01/24, 6:11 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Sorry the battery is too low the phone will shut down
16/01/24, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: We are about to end Nigel!
16/01/24, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
16/01/24, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
17/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 805 8546: hello
17/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 71 312 0416: Sorry there is no electricity here so the phone was off
17/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 312 0416: You can explain
17/01/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
17/01/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/01/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 312 0416: Yes
17/01/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
17/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 71 312 0416: Yes, visa application. 
Am I going to pay again
17/01/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
17/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK thank you
17/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Sorry for the delay I was running stomach suddenly attack me
17/01/24, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand!
17/01/24, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
17/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 71 312 0416: When am I coming to India
17/01/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Please note that you will be coming to India in the month of August- September 2024
17/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK thank you
17/01/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear now?
17/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Yes just waiting for the letter
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

18/01/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: By this, Nigel, it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me? <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 312 0416: It's ok
18/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 71 312 0416: They said they don't have any questions
18/01/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 312 0416: They were saying how about if we pay half- half because they can't pay all the money at the same time
18/01/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Have you considered the payment plan?
18/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 312 0416: No
18/01/24, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once!
18/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 312 0416: Ok
18/01/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So,  I hope that you are clear with that as It states that *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

I hope this payment plan is convenient to your family.
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Yes it is
18/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
18/01/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
18/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Yes what about the fees
18/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 312 0416: I can't wait to come
18/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also glad to see your eagerness!!
18/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by an Edoofian through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
18/01/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
18/01/24, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 312 0416: So I have to pay for the Visa, Transport, enrollment fee and registration fee as well
18/01/24, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$750, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2023-2024 and the remaining $700 in January 2024-2025.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee* However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$1250-$1500*, which would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee*

18/01/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: yes Nigel!

18/01/24, 2:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when you will be getting your pay?
18/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 805 8546: I have already withdrew so I am waiting for my next month payment which is on 14 February 

I don't if it is ok
18/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 805 8546: I don't know if it is OK
18/01/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moleen, please note that it will be too late, considering the current situation. We are currently facing a high volume of applications, compounded by the release of A-level results. Additionally, the availability of seats is limited, making it imperative to expedite the process.
18/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 805 8546: ok so give us a date so that we can hustle before that date
18/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moleen, If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of January. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
18/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 805 8546: no
18/01/24, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Ms. Moleen the financial concerns, and If I have to request for a payment plan for you considering your concerns!
18/01/24, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 805 8546: look I'm am a civil servant here and I am payed $150 USD and the $50 in rtgs that's why I was saying next month so I could risk all the $150 to pay for my child
18/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 805 8546: please
18/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moleen, I understand your concern, As you see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
18/01/24, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
18/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Can we proceed
18/01/24, 4:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: We are waiting for you mother's acknowledgment on this!
18/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK OK can we proceed
18/01/24, 4:44 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK I think they will a way to get that money and I know they will pay
18/01/24, 4:45 pm - +263 71 312 0416: They will find a way
18/01/24, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that from you Nigel,

Also, I would like to know if you are having someone in your family member to help you with the same!
18/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 71 312 0416: I hope so
18/01/24, 4:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Nigel, please note We can only proceed with your eligibility check test once an acknowledgment is received from your parent!
18/01/24, 4:50 pm - +263 71 312 0416: OK let me talk to them then we proceed tomorrow

19/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 312 0416: The problem is they don't have money now
19/01/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when will they can manage the enrollment fees?

19/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand your financial concerns, but I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving.
*I believe you are a deserving candidate!*
19/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, Nigel, I could do one thing for you, I can suggest a payment plan to you, considering your financial challenges! <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 312 0416: Like I have said before,  they did not have money now but if we push the dates it will be fine
19/01/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Pushing the dates to March will be too late as you know the scenario, A level results are out already and students are willing to pursue as soon as possible and due to limited number of seats you might not miss this Opportunity,

According to me, your parents can take help from friends or relatives to pay the first 100$ -200$ so, as to reserve a seat!
19/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 312 0416: What about end of February
