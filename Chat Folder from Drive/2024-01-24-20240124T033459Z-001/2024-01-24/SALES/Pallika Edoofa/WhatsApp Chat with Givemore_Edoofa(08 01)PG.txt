How are you doing today?

12/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Hope I find you well
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yes I am so confident
12/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Yeah I did a research on foreign education but not yet applied
12/01/24, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky
12/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Givemore, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

23/01/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing well, what about you?

23/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Please
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
23/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Oky thanks if you say so because my father was so worried about the visa and flight fees
23/01/24, 9:03 pm - +263 71 852 4406: Because of his salary he could not afford to pay flight fees and visa because here in Zimbabwe it cost about $2000 usd
23/01/24, 9:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Givemore, I understand that!
23/01/24, 9:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to share with you that the Edoofa scholarship program not only provides you the scholarship up to 50-100% but also provides you an opportunity to self finance your higher education!
