Upon completion of her primary she went to a boarding school where she did her form one until four . Passed her ordinary level with 9 subjects with good passes. She is currently doing advanced level upper six specializing in Arts. She is a good talker whom I feel if she would pursue law she will excel. Laurah is a confident person who is open to air her views. Considering her age so far as a parent who spends most of my time with her I don't have any challenges interms of discipline and responsibilities. She is good with others ,very social and responsible even in carrying out her duties as a child or as a big sister to her brother. She loves reading novels online and watching television. She is not an outgoing person ,enjoys indoor activities. 
Her family is madeup of me and my husband and her little brother aged 11. Am an environmental healthy officer under the ministry of homeaffars currently working at Zrp Gweru camp clinic here in Zimbabwe. The father is self employed,he buys and sell stationery here in Zimbabwe. As a family we look forward to her future as she is our first born child whom we are trying to help her have a better future.
In short this is what I can say . If I missed out something please ask I will answer you.
