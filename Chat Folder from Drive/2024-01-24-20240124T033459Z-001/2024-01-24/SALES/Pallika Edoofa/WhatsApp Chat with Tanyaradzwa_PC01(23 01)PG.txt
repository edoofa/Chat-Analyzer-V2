23/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/01/24, 12:18 pm - +27 74 285 7749: Is the zimbabwe government involved in this programme or its a private thing
23/01/24, 12:22 pm - +27 69 810 2974: I'm still applying
23/01/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Hillary, Edoofa Scholarship Program is an Indian Scholarship Program, however as a parent I can understand that your question is more regarding the legitimacy of the Program and process, so regarding the same, shall I share a few details with you please?
