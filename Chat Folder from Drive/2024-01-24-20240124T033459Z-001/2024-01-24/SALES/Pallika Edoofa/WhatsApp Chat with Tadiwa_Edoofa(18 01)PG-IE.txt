*I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa and we also have with us Ms Pallika Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions.* 

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Tadiwa Elizabeth Muteka. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?
18/01/24, 12:16 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly.
18/01/24, 12:17 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 12:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Meanwhile Tadiwa, I believe Lynnte, must have shared with you a questionnaire consisting of 6 questions, Can you please share your responses to those questions in this group with us again, So that we can verify your application before the counselling session?
18/01/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
18/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 252 0686: Hi
18/01/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Tadiwa, 
How are you doing today?
18/01/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

19/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
19/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 252 0686: Thank you for the opportunity but l would like to make a request that you may terminate my application
19/01/24, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason?
19/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 252 0686: l wanna do law so I first have to do it here
19/01/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand that but how are you planning to do so, do you know about the fees of Law over there?
19/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 252 0686: Yess l do l have done a research
19/01/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
19/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 252 0686: Not yet
19/01/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: See, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
19/01/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
19/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 252 0686: Thank you so much but with law program it has to be done in Zimbabwe because they don't recognize any other law degree from other countries so if l practice outside when l come back here l have to write another exams for me to be able to practice
19/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwa, I understand the importance of pursuing your law program in Zimbabwe due to local recognition. However, keep in mind that obtaining a law degree in India can offer you global recognition. With an internationally recognized degree, you may have the flexibility to practice law in various parts of the world without the need for additional exams upon your return to Zimbabwe. It's worth exploring the possibilities that an Indian law degree can provide for your future career aspirations.
19/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 252 0686: Thank you so much
19/01/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to continue?
19/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
