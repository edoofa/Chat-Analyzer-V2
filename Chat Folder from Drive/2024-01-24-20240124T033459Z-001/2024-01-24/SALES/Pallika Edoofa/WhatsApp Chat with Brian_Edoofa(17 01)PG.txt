We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Brian Nherera. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?
16/01/24, 11:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly
16/01/24, 11:12 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:05 am - +263 77 351 2405: Sorry Brian returned to school he is doing his A level hope he will apply again just after his completion
17/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
17/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 351 2405: Not ready this time
17/01/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Misheck I understand, since schools in Zimbabwe have reopened, students are currently engaged in lessons and exam preparations, rendering them unavailable. This situation contrasts with Western African countries where students have already received their results. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that scholarship seats could be filled by students from these regions, posing a potential disadvantage for Zimbabwean students.

These factors particularly affect boarding students and those who are restricted from using devices in school. By the time they return, the opportunity may have been taken by other applicants. To address this concern, our Academic Board, in consultation with universities, has decided to allow parents to participate in the seat reservation interview for their children. This ensures that no deserving applicant is overlooked.
17/01/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: So as of now parents do have a chance in representing their child under the evaluation process, so would it be possible for us to have a discussion regarding the same please?
17/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Yes it is the right person
17/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Yes the process can continue
17/01/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright! Before proceeding please add your mother too
17/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 71 662 4353: Okay
17/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 662 4353: And by the way ,I'm at school so I will be coming online here n there on my free time ..maybe my parents will cover some stuff for me.
17/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 71 662 4353: She's already in the group
17/01/24, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Brian, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:

20/01/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 878 3230: No we haven't applied or researched for any university abroad
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
