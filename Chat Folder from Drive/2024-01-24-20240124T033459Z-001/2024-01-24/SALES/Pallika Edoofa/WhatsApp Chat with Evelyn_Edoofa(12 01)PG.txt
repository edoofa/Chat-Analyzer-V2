19/01/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
