*I am Mr. Piyush, The Head of Counselling at Edoofa and we also have with us Ms Pallika Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions.* 

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Samuel Mleme. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?
23/01/24, 9:13 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly.
