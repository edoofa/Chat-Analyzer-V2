18/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know why the grades are low?
18/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 293 8488: We also expected something better than this.But not sure where he went wrong and the gap between the symbols also a surprise
18/01/24, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
18/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 293 8488: Not yet done much research, but we have no problem with that
18/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 293 8488: Understood, and also as parents we always encouraged him to score high.We tried to engage private tutors for him throughout his A level studies, just like we did for O level
18/01/24, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Maphosa, It's wonderful to hear about the proactive and supportive approach you've taken as parents, consistently encouraging and investing in your son's education
18/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 293 8488: Ok thank you, will go through the document
18/01/24, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me know once done!
18/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Have gone through the article.
18/01/24, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I would like to know that if Purpose is interested in the Medical field, why hasn't Purpose pursued Biology to the A level?
18/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 293 8488: We might have overlooked that maybe without adequate knowledge.But they were being guided at school.
18/01/24, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand!

Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since he does not have Biology, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering his interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that he is eligible for and which can help fulfill his dreams of working in this field
*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*

*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

Would you like me to explain any of these programs to you?
18/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Yes do explain so that we have a picture
18/01/24, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know which course you would like me to explain?
18/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 293 8488: If he is to pursue Engineering; Do you have the following; Civil Engineering, Mineral processing,Meteology,Mining Engineering.
18/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Maphosa, he meets the eligibility criteria for engineering courses. I would, however, appreciate information on the specific field of engineering he is interested in pursuing.
18/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Thank you late me wait to hear from him
18/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Mining Engineering
18/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse the delay as my meeting took a little longer than expected!
18/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!!
18/01/24, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Maphosa, Please note that Mining is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line. 

One of the primary reasons why mining may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment. 

Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining and other professionals in the field. 

In conclusion, mining may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I acknowledge Prosper's  interest in mining engineering and your comprehensive analysis of the challenges it may face in the future. Considering the evolving landscape, I would recommend exploring mechanical engineering, which offers a versatile skill set applicable across various industries and remains resilient to the shifting dynamics you've highlighted in the mining sector. This way, you can ensure a robust and adaptable foundation for your engineering career.

19/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Mpofu, Please let me explain mechanical engineering in depth once
19/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

20/01/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
 
I am here to begin our session,

Shall we begin?
20/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 293 8488: Not yet ready now, we are a bit tied up.Lets try in the afternoon
20/01/24, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know once available
22/01/24, 10:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you had a great weekend!

Are you ready for today's discussion?
22/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 293 8488: Morning,we can start
22/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Ms. Maphosa?
22/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Maphosa, I would like you to actively respond for next 20-25 minutes so that we can proceed with Prosper's application for Stage 2
22/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session  *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
22/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 293 8488: Yes l know it's very expensive, though not sure of the exact figures
22/01/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/01/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
22/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 293 8488: As a family we can afford $2000 per annum
22/01/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
22/01/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
22/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 293 8488: No idea on how it is done, but l heard that there are work opportunities
22/01/24, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/01/24, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/01/24, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
22/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Let me read through
22/01/24, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me know once done!
22/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Seems there are benefits from Earn while you learn program
22/01/24, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
22/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 293 8488: Yes
22/01/24, 9:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/01/24, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, and Proceeding towards the *ELIGIBILITY CHECK TEST & INTERVIEW*, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 278 8926: It's oky i understand
23/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for understanding!
