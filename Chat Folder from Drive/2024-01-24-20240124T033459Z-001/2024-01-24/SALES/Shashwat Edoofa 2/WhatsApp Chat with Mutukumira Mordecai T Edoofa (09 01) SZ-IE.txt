19/01/24, 9:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mordecai. To pursue a course in architecture, it is imperative for students to meet the minimum academic requirements, typically comprising Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics in their A-Level studies. These subjects form the foundational knowledge base essential for understanding the principles of architecture and design. Physics provides insights into structural mechanics and material properties, Chemistry contributes to an understanding of construction materials and their interactions, while Mathematics is fundamental for complex calculations and spatial reasoning in architectural planning. This combination ensures that students have the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in the multidisciplinary field of architecture, encompassing both the scientific and creative aspects of the profession, Mordecai! <This message was edited>

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
