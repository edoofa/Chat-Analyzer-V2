18/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir I did
18/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 069 4460: It is quite interesting to get to know that in the previous session I learnt that Indian education system does not cater only for Indian students but also for international children  who include Africans students. Through the previous session I also got to know that the system allows one to have an opportunity to explore various array of discipline as well as exploring other people's talents and also culture from different groups of people from many parts of the world . Furthermore, I got to the benefits of associating with different groups of people such as promotion of unity.

I also got to know why Edoofa recommend India for higher education that is through:it's ability to  one of the nations that provide world's best education. I also find out that not only provide quality education but also grooms a student to be a better person in the future through it's global recognition and career prospects.

I believe that if I am granted the opportunity to study in India it will help me to achieve  my career goal in the sense that Indian education is globally recognized and has career prospects and this helps me as trust would have been instilled in me since organisations and companies as well as government institutions will not doubt my capability  of doing their work Upto  best standards knowing very well that I hold a degree from Indian education system.
I also believe that courses being taught in English will  make me build self confidence in interacting with people from different parts of the world.

18/01/24, 5:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I apologize for the delay. I was facing technical difficulties, but all is well now. Thank you for your patience.
18/01/24, 5:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
18/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir I am aware
18/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir I am aware of the costs.
18/01/24, 8:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel free to share the information, Yolanda.
18/01/24, 8:36 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Good evening Sir . I am aware that higher education requireds financial  backup if one does not have access to a scholarship but my situation is different in the sense that my parents cannot afford expenses needed for my tertiary education since they have my younger siblings to take care of.
18/01/24, 8:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Yolanda! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/01/24, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
18/01/24, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
18/01/24, 8:52 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Like I told you earlier my father is the only one who takes care of our financial responsibilities  my mother is not employeed so my father being an African teacher , Zimbabwe in specific it is difficult for him to raise such amount of money as well as to cover the  financial needs of the other children.
18/01/24, 9:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
18/01/24, 9:14 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay dear Sir the think is My father earns only $300 per he cannot afford to pay for tertiary education because that little amount has to cover all expenses at our house.
18/01/24, 9:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please?
18/01/24, 9:18 pm - +263 78 069 4460: The tuition fee part sir.
18/01/24, 9:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
18/01/24, 9:21 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir I read it.
18/01/24, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
18/01/24, 9:30 pm - +263 78 069 4460: It ranges from $500 -$600 USD per semester.
18/01/24, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
18/01/24, 9:44 pm - +263 78 069 4460: That's true sir the situation is not pleasing  at all. Therefore, it's not  my wish to get such type of degree .

19/01/24, 8:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

19/01/24, 9:01 am - +263 78 069 4460: Good morning sir . I am ready.
19/01/24, 9:20 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Yolanda!

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
19/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 77 746 9271: Yes sir guide me
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Marvellous. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
19/01/24, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
19/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 069 4460: Okay thank you sir you made it clear to me that the Earn While You Learn program is  very beneficial since one will be able to finance their own education expenses . It reduces the strain of financial support from parents . Through webinars one will be able to  enjoy convince which help them to participate  comfortably since physical participation is not a must,they are also cost effective which helps students to save money. I have also learnt that the EWYL program creates an opportunity  which may lead one into a market ready professional.
19/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
19/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
19/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
19/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

19/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 069 4460: Yes thank you sir this is amazing  now I understand how the Earn While You Learn program reduce financial pressure on student's parents.
19/01/24, 11:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Yolanda. May I know whether you think it is affordable now, please?
19/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir   personally I think it in is affordable but I don't know my parent's point of view.
19/01/24, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
19/01/24, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/01/24, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 069 4460: Thank you sir I appreciate them all but point number 2 is very crucial.Employability through  practical training helps students  to gain experience to build confidence in their future career .
19/01/24, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Yolanda! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
19/01/24, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 069 4460: My family is really supportive it might not be financial support from the other family members but the love , efforts and advice they provide is extraordinary . I really appreciate their support sir
19/01/24, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
19/01/24, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
19/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir that is true . I think one needs to have a valid passport , transcript from previous studies, language proficiency certification and curriculum vitae. That is what I think sir.
19/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
19/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 746 9271: Okay sir I have gone through the information thank you.
19/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir thank you for the information.
19/01/24, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir I understand thank you
19/01/24, 1:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
19/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir I understood that   there are options which were brought forward by Edoofa to reduce the burden of enrollment fee through making parents pay in installments . I also understood that t  Edoofa created programs through which students may help ease financial strain from their parents such as the Earn While You Learn program. I also learnt that Edoofa help students to create the statement of purpose . Edoofa also support students through Visa documentation Assistance, University selection and seels learning center  classes of which individuals who do not have support of Edoofa will need to face the expenses all alone.
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 746 9271: Okay sir we are at stage one
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Thank you sir we are at stage 1.
19/01/24, 1:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
19/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 746 9271: Thank you sir you can explain the remaining stages to me
19/01/24, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
19/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir is enrollment fee and admission fee the same thing?
19/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you are referring to the registration fee, please?
19/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Yes sir clarify to me please about the registration fee.
19/01/24, 2:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Yolanda. This registration fee isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself, please.
19/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir thank you.
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/01/24, 2:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

22/01/24, 10:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Pursuing tertiary education abroad requires financial planning. May I know whether your family have contrived a financial plan for the respective decision?
22/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 069 4460: Yes they have planned but its only  that they are experiencing financial instability due to examination fees and school fees for my siblings
22/01/24, 11:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Yolanda. I would like to inform you that your commencement of tertiary education is scheduled for July-August 2024. This allows you a seven-month window to make arrangements for the tuition fees. Currently, we are focusing on an initial payment of $350, and you can ease into the process by contributing $150 next month. I hope this clarifies the payment structure for the upcoming months. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated.
22/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 069 4460: Okay Sir they have agreed to focus on initial payment

22/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 069 4460: It's okay sir thank you
22/01/24, 12:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
22/01/24, 12:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could they kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
22/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 069 4460: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/01/24, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/01/24, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

22/01/24, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th January 2024 for $200 and the 28th or 29th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
