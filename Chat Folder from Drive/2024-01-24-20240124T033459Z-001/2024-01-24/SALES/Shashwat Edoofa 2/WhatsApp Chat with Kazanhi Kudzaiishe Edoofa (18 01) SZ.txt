19/01/24, 1:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Following
19/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Yes we can
19/01/24, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That's the spirit! Now being your Counselor, I would like to know you better as a student so please tell me more about yourself. Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
19/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 5723: I was thrilled when I saw the scholarship opportunity and with this letter I would like to express my gratitude to the government for this program.I've completed high school and I came out with 13 points and I wish to pursue medicine at a tertiary level.

In high school, i was an adept biology student and a critical thinker. My passion to save lives, made my career path so clear, that i did not have to think twice about it. I believe there is more I will contribute, to the medicine world with my personal zeal and the benchmarks i have set for myself. I believe with research and personal drive, there are some solutions to problems which the world has left alone and claimed not feasible to cure. 
My vision is to make sure that, people benefit from the skills i would have acquired and to help in running many health institutions. The other key thing i believe in, is to strengthen service delivery, so that like the days of old, people have all their faith in the doctors. My arsenary of skills from good communication skills, empathy and hardworking, draw a rift from the rest 

Having spent most of my time in an environment that requires me to work hard even to get the small things has helped me to aspire, have dreams and set goals that I need to achieve.Even though I claim to have a vision for my goals I feel like it's just a dream that is yet to be brought to reality as there are a lot of obstacles that need to be overcame.

I spent most of my childhood in Bindura at Muchapondwa Primary School where my parents were teachers.We didn't have much as a family but at least we were well to do.We then relocated to Arcturus Mine when my father passed on  in 2015 due to liver cirrhosis.This really affected our family as our father was the breadwinner and from then my mother had to take care of us on her own.My mother failed to maintain some of the standards that my brother had to drop out of boarding school.In primary I struggled a lot as I could not fit in with the other learners.This pushed me to work even harder as I hoped for a better life.

As I went into high school I then discovered my interest and I figured out that I wanted to be a medical doctor.At that time we had gained stability as a family as my mother had picked up some side hustles. Mother would always encourage me to work hard and that compelled me to greatness.In class I would always come second keeping in my mind my background and the goals I had set for myself.When I were in form four my mother passed on due to COVID-19.This broke me down to the extent that I never thought I would make it,I lost faith in my abilities.My mother was our pillar,she cartered for everything and yet she was gone.

My Uncle then took us in and sent me to school since I were in form four l till now  I have finished high school.My uncle and sister had to work day and night for them im to provide for the extended family.Now that I have to go to university my uncle and sister feels they  can nolonger fund my education as medicine study can be quite expensive since he still have other children that are in need  of his attention.

Looking from where I've came from I actually can't give up now on my dreams.What pushes me the most is the fact that I lost both of my parents due to lack of proper treatment because we didn't have money and I would really want to be a doctor one day and save lives.Even though my uncle can nolonger provide for me I still feel the zeal to pursue my goals despite that my situation is saying otherwise. 

That's why I have considered applying for a  scholarship hoping and entrusting that I get a favourable reply so that I ease off the burden for my uncle and sister <This message was edited>

Much appreciated 🤝🤝🤝
19/01/24, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Marondera High School* charged you every term, and who in your family financially supported your education?
19/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 588 5723: $450 to $500 per term since the practical fees kept on being alternated
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 588 5723: My uncle did and as well my sister contributed
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
19/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 588 5723: I think my uncle will do mostly
19/01/24, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly add him to the group as well, please?
19/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Okay

19/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Mr M Mupandasekwa
19/01/24, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Mupandasekwa!
20/01/24, 7:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good morning to all! I trust this message finds you well. I extend my sincere apologies for the delay in communication. Unfortunately, my device encountered significant technical issues, hindering my ability to connect with you yesterday. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. I am now ready to commence the session. Kindly confirm your availability at your earliest convenience. Additionally, could you please confirm if you are ready to proceed with the session? Thank you.
20/01/24, 7:42 am - +263 78 588 5723: Good morning
It's okay
We can proceed
20/01/24, 11:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
20/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Good afternoon
I completed my A levels in 2023

20/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 588 5723: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Well what compels me to study abroad is the fact that the only university that offers medicine is the University of zimbabwe and that means that there's a lot of competition there and the chances of one getting a place there are very slim.The other thing is that since I'm in a quest for a scholarship ,applying at university of zimbabwe I do not think I'll ever get it there. The other thing is that personally I had always dreamt of myself doing my tertiary level abroad so if I get a chance it will be a dream come true.Lastly India is one of the best places for medicine and I feel if I'm to study there they'll train and groom me into a good doctor in no question. <This message was edited>
20/01/24, 5:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Kudzaiishe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
20/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 78 588 5723: Thank you

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
22/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 588 5723: Good morning
22/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 588 5723: Im sorry I'm late
But I'm ready now
22/01/24, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Kudzaiishe!
22/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 588 5723: Yes I am thank you and you
22/01/24, 9:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am doing fine as well, Kudzaiishe. Thank you for asking!
22/01/24, 9:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly, please?
22/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 588 5723: Okay
22/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 588 5723: Well my aspiration to become a doctor dates back to when I was young till now I've always been driven to become a medical doctor.Although when I was young I didn't quite understand what being a doctor is but my desire was heightened by the death of my parents due to lack of proper medication and other sick people I came across as I was growing up. As I grew up I  steadily understood what it entailed being a doctor and that strengthened my desire even more of becoming a doctor .The fact that doctors save lives also forms part of why I want to be a doctor.My passion to save lives made my career path so clear that I did not have to think twice about it. I believe there is more I will contribute to the medicine world with my personal zeal and my aspiration. The other thing is that being a medical doctor is one of the prestigious jobs one can get.My vision is to make sure that people benefit from the skills that I would have acquired over the training years and bring betterment to their lives. I want to be able to save lives of disadvantaged people , those born with deformities and those that are less privileged.This reason being inspired by the plight of people who live in third-world  countries who are unfortunate and cannot afford their own medication.Im also inspired by my role model Andiswa who is also a becoming doctor, listening to her most of times makes me feel like I'm a doctor already.My other motivation is that I love knowing things especially about the human body being able to understand my body well and my strong interest in mathematics, biology and chemistry pushes me forward.
I hope I answered the question.
22/01/24, 10:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I commend your unwavering determination, and your commitment to pursuing a career in the healthcare field is truly admirable. Your desire to contribute to the healthcare sector has been shaped by personal experiences, particularly the loss of your parents due to a lack of proper medication. It is clear that your compassionate nature has been fueled by the challenges you witnessed while growing up, and your decision to embark on a path that aims to address such issues reflects both resilience and empathy, Kudzaiishe.
22/01/24, 10:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Kudzaiishe, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
22/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 588 5723: Okay
22/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 588 5723: Thank you
22/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 588 5723: I didn't do physics because the school I attended Nyadire High for my Ordinary level when we first chose our science subjects and they didn't offer physics because they couldn't find a physics teacher.So when I moved to Advanced level at Marondera High it was kind of impossible for me to start physics at an advanced level since I didn't learn the basics or might I say the foundation
22/01/24, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 588 5723: So does that mean I can't do medicine in India if I don't have physics
22/01/24, 11:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Kudzaiishe. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
22/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 588 5723: Yes please
22/01/24, 11:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
22/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 588 5723: How about pharmacy
22/01/24, 11:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what fascinated you regarding that peculiar domain, please?
22/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 588 5723: I just had it as a second option
