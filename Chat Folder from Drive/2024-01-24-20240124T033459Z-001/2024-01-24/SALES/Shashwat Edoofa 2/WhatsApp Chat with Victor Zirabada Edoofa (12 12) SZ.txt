Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: From my research medical studies abroad primarily offer a chance to widen one’s perspective, and be familiar with the international medical field. All of which can give me an edge in the arena considering that practicing medicine is a global career. And it would also offer an opportunity to see more of the world generally. 


As I have always looked up to my relatives from abroad pulling more of the weight of the whole family's difficult struggles all pushing me to become a better self to be able to pull my own weight and help the coming generations of my family to live a better life.
This would be the main motivation to working hard
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Year of completion of A level is 2023
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I will arrange for the scanned pictures as soon as I can

It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will be waiting for your response, Victor.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 71 300 2882: Not yet can we begin at 10:30am
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor!
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
16/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 300 2882: I want to go and collect my hard copy of the A level certificate at my school, and network may falter as i go there and back. I wouldn't want to seem ignorant to our session by replying late.
16/01/24, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Victor. Let us connect at *10:30 A.M. CAT* to resume your session. I will be looking forward to your response.
16/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I'm now ready to connect
16/01/24, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Victor, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
16/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I was pursuing all four subjects at the beginning of my Grade 12th year but the weight/pressure became intense and as uninformed as I was then and with poor career guidance. I had believed writting Biology was the best way forward only to discover later that physics is a mandatory subject to pursue what I want abroad.
16/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 300 2882: It is a crucial science
16/01/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 300 2882: 1400-2000
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I'm not sure
19/01/24, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Victor! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
19/01/24, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
19/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
19/01/24, 3:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
19/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
19/01/24, 6:26 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Absolutely beneficial sir
20/01/24, 7:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good morning to all! I trust this message finds you well. I extend my sincere apologies for the delay in communication. Unfortunately, my device encountered significant technical issues, hindering my ability to connect with you yesterday. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. I am now ready to commence the session. Kindly confirm your availability at your earliest convenience. Additionally, could you please confirm if you are ready to proceed with the session? Thank you.
20/01/24, 9:17 am - +263 71 300 2882: I'm now ready
20/01/24, 10:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor!
20/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

20/01/24, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
20/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 300 2882: 4
20/01/24, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Victor! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
20/01/24, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 71 300 2882: They are very happy considering the idea of being an edoofian and studying in India with  the EWYL program and the other benefits. They are not very supportive on the course chosen
20/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 300 2882: And would prefer I change course to Radiography once I get my Physics result.
20/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 300 2882: If possible
20/01/24, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 9:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
22/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 71 300 2882: Yeah
22/01/24, 9:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor! <This message was edited>
22/01/24, 9:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on your concerns, please?
22/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 300 2882: Can I change course to Radiography if I get a Physics results in August
22/01/24, 9:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have done any prior research regarding Radiography and its future prospects, please?
22/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 71 300 2882: yes
22/01/24, 9:57 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel free to share the information in the group, please.
22/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 300 2882: Radiography is a really interesting and in-demand field, so there are definitely some great prospects for people who pursue it as a career. Radiographers are in high demand, especially in the healthcare field, so Iam likely to have a lot of job opportunities. And the pay is often pretty good, especially if I specialize in a particular area of radiography.
22/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 300 2882: I can further enhance this into being a Radiologist. Which is a really interesting and challenging field! If i become a radiologist, i'll be responsible for interpreting medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. It takes a lot of training and expertise to become a radiologist, but it can be a very rewarding career.
22/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 300 2882: Hence the unyielding interest in it
22/01/24, 10:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your inclination towards becoming a Radiologist is truly commendable, and it's evident that you recognize the fascinating and challenging nature of this field. As a Radiologist, you would play a pivotal role in interpreting crucial medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. The journey to becoming a radiologist does require significant training and expertise, but the rewards of making accurate medical diagnoses and contributing to patient care can be immensely fulfilling. However, I would like to draw your attention to another dynamic field – Cardiovascular Technology. In this specialized area, you would have the opportunity to focus on cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics, dealing specifically with the heart and blood vessels. The role is equally challenging and rewarding, providing a unique avenue to contribute to healthcare. Exploring cardiovascular technology might align with your interests and offer a distinctive pathway to make a positive impact in the medical field. May I know whether you find that fascinating, please?
22/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Is it also in high demand❔
22/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 71 300 2882: And what pathways can one pursue after passing the course
22/01/24, 12:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Cardiovascular Technology is a field with high demand and promising career prospects. Specializing in imaging and diagnosing heart and blood vessel conditions, Cardiovascular Technologists play a crucial role in supporting cardiovascular healthcare, a domain that continues to see increasing demand for skilled professionals. Upon completion of the Cardiovascular Technology course, your child can explore diverse pathways, such as becoming a Cardiac Catheterization Technologist, Echocardiography Technologist, Vascular Technologist, or Electrocardiogram (ECG) Technician. This field not only equips individuals with specialized skills but also offers a rewarding career dedicated to cardiovascular health, providing opportunities to make a meaningful impact on patients' lives, Victor!
22/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Which countries would I have to be in for employment
22/01/24, 1:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate further on your concerns, please?
22/01/24, 9:45 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Demand in Zimbabwe, or would I have to go abroad somewhere, I am curious on whether after finishing the course would you assist me getting a job since in my Country those professions aren't available.
23/01/24, 8:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good morning to all! I trust this message finds you well. I extend my sincere apologies for the delay in communication. Unfortunately, my device encountered significant technical issues, hindering my ability to connect with you yesterday. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. I am now ready to commence the session. Kindly confirm your availability at your earliest convenience. Additionally, could you please confirm if you are ready to proceed with the session? Thank you.
23/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yeah
23/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor!
23/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor, you will be glad to know that in your university during the final year, a plethora of companies will conduct placement drives. If you are competent, you will be able to score a job in your dream company!
23/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 300 2882: This message was deleted
23/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Okay sir
23/01/24, 12:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
23/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Other requirements can include financial stability, a clean criminal record, and a valid passport.
23/01/24, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
23/01/24, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/01/24, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Okay
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Okay
23/01/24, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
23/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 300 2882: If student is found eligible for scholarship he/she will be charged with $350 enrollment fee to join Edoofa program and get assisted with several important aspects of claiming and taking a seat at a university abroad. This fee can be paid in two installments considering current situation in African Nations.
23/01/24, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
23/01/24, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 71 300 2882: 03
23/01/24, 8:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/01/24, 9:17 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
23/01/24, 9:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
23/01/24, 9:21 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
23/01/24, 9:21 pm - +263 71 300 2882: But is it possible that you can send me a list of your partnered Universities
23/01/24, 9:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/01/24, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

23/01/24, 9:25 pm - +263 71 300 2882: If possible can you send me a list of your partnered Universities
23/01/24, 9:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor. We have worked with a diverse network of over 250 globally recognized universities. The university recommendations are provided during the later stages of the process, once your application has successfully advanced through the counseling session, as each application is unique and tailored to individual qualifications and aspirations! May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer, please?

23/01/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Victor!
23/01/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
