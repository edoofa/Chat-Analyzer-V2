11/01/24, 11:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Nhamo. I truly appreciate your sincerity! You mentioned Moreblessings's affinity towards Business Administration. Could you kindly brief me regarding her Career Aspirations more vividly, please?
11/01/24, 11:51 am - +27 83 955 2554: Ok.thanks a lot for your time ...she actually  aspires to be a business administrator  .She however has also a passion  in Nursing..so these are the two fields that she has always been talking about since childhood..we therefore ask for a clearer course outline so that given an opportunity, she chooses between Business administration  and Nursing..we ,as her parents would highly  appreciate if she finds her self getting one of this fields.
11/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know which field intrigues her the most, please?
11/01/24, 12:25 pm - +27 83 955 2554: Nursing sir/madam
11/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew her towards this peculiar domain, please?
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - +27 83 955 2554: I remember  well when she was at primary level,at a very tender age,she was was an Actor in the school drama.so she happened to be a Nurse in one of the drama series..so she developed  a passion in Nursing..we had to advise her to make sure she passes English,Maths and science at ordinary level. She worked extremely  hard and managed to pass these among others..she still  maintains that if she becomes a nurse ,it will be a dream come true
11/01/24, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mr. Nhamo, could you please share why Moreblessings didn't pursue Physics, Chemistry, or Biology in her A level?

I believe they are very crucial science/medical subjects, isn't it?
11/01/24, 3:35 pm - +27 83 955 2554: In Zimbabwe  ,for one to be enrolled at Nursing institutions,Maths ,English and integrated science are prerequisite..so she mastered those and manage to pass those among  other subjects.Physics ,chemistry and biology  are pursued by somebody who wants to undertake medical doctor profession.For sure they are crucial ..The reason  she did not do pursue science subjects emanate from the fact that the Nursing institutions require ordinary level passes which she has,and They consider A level as an added advantage.
11/01/24, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your perspective, Mr. Nhamo. However, I will have to inform you that the minimum threshold that a student needs to fulfill in order to pursue Nursing/ Medicine is Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in his/her A-Level, please.
11/01/24, 3:45 pm - +27 83 955 2554: Understood,the Zimbabwean requirements at diploma level are different  from the scenario you have just stated...that is why I had wanted  to see course outlines and requirements...sometimes one has to do a completely different study due to failure  to meet the requirements of the preferred area of study...kindly help so that we choose  from the programs available...
11/01/24, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nhamo. May I know whether Moreblessings is interested in pursuing business administration, please?
11/01/24, 4:27 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Yes sir I have interest in pursuing bussiness administration
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what fascinates you regarding the domain, please?
11/01/24, 5:28 pm - +27 61 641 4334: The world has turned into a very complex system whereby at some point one has to be their own employer.so I feel if I do business administration,I stand a chance of being my own boss.besides,I can qualify working both in the private and public sector.bussiness is life.
11/01/24, 5:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Moreblessings. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations.

It's completely normal to face obstacles, and what matters most is how you navigate through them!
15/01/24, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Moreblessings! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
15/01/24, 4:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

15/01/24, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

16/01/24, 8:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself." - John Dewey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 11:18 am - +27 61 641 4334: Yes
16/01/24, 11:20 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Moreblessings!
16/01/24, 11:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
16/01/24, 11:33 am - +27 61 641 4334: They feel to be a little bit high because they are not working formal jobs ,if there is any other room of a lowered fee we would really appreciate
16/01/24, 11:34 am - +27 61 641 4334: To them this one it seems to be affordable
16/01/24, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Moreblessings. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
16/01/24, 12:14 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Yes please
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Moreblessings. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
16/01/24, 2:44 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Yàaa it will  be beneficial,it reduces some other cost ,I will be able to support my parents by paying a half of my school fees ,and I will be able to support myself through financially ,on the other hand it helps alot  because I will be able to get an experienced while learning  and having an eye to see how people manage and work in the bussiness so that when I got a chance to be fully employed after finishing my degree it will be very easy ,this EWYL I think it is  best and helpful
16/01/24, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
16/01/24, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
16/01/24, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
16/01/24, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

16/01/24, 3:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
16/01/24, 3:12 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Ok thank you..yaaa I see this EWYL is the best bcz I will be able to reduce financial pressure on my parents ,and gain some experience and skills
16/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
16/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/01/24, 3:44 pm - +27 61 641 4334: All I can say is EWYL is gud for me and my parents,since they are not financially stable it will help us alot by reducing the burden of the cost of my education,I think it will be best for me
16/01/24, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/01/24, 4:31 pm - +27 61 641 4334: As their first born,They want me to achieve something gud  in life and to become more  successful so that I will be able to support them financially in future ,I can see my parents by supporting me in all of these ,they want me to get a good educational facilities by going abroad..so am sure they will be happy if I got the opportunity of going abroad
16/01/24, 4:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
16/01/24, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
16/01/24, 5:00 pm - +27 61 641 4334: I think 
Passport and study visa
16/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
16/01/24, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/01/24, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
16/01/24, 5:07 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Ok thank you
16/01/24, 5:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
