13/01/24, 10:51 am - Kunal: That is fine
Ensure to share them soon, in the meantime, may I know your A level subjects?
13/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 711 4956: I am doing Maths , Biology , Chemistry and Food science
13/01/24, 10:52 am - Kunal: Noted
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 711 4956: I understand
13/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 711 4956: I will do my best
13/01/24, 11:07 am - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Medical field, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
13/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 711 4956: I didn't opt for physics at A level because l thought that MBC was the combination that would help accomplish my dreams
13/01/24, 11:25 am - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 711 4956: I understand
13/01/24, 11:48 am - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field
