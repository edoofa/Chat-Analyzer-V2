1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with Stanley?
12/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 790 1256: 1).  It has being my dream  to study abroad  .  Hearing about Edoofa from my friend and making me join his group and hearing what he was saying he about the program and the pictures and videos he showed us of proud Edoofians and the benefits it has like for example how you would help us get a job afterwards and the money payout structure really inspired me to apply


2) My understanding of the program is 

-Edoofa full fills the dream of studying in India that is if you met up with necessary requirements
- The enrollment fee of Edoofa is what it used to pay to apply for all universities in India and it's more beneficial than here in Zimbabwe because you be just applying without any guarantee of any acceptance of the universities
- The University points requirements are not as harsh as of Zimbabwe which is very strict with points 
-Edoofa has striving students they pass and make Edoofa happy
- Edoofa has never been associated with any scandalous business it is legit does everything which is by law 
- Edoofa takes care of it's Edoofians when in India be it food or medical aid 
-Edoofa helps you to apply for the program l want and if l am accepted they will take care of everything else
- Edoofa even helps with the applying of visa and makes everything easy for me
12/01/24, 2:54 pm - Kunal: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
23/01/24, 10:32 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone
