I hope you all are doing fine.

We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.
Since we are experiencing a rush of applicants, we wish that no deserving candidate misses the opportunity. So, if you are not willing to continue, we will be revoking your application by the end of today *(19/08/2023)* and will be allotting your slot to the next applicant.

In case you wish to proceed with the program, make sure to notify the group at the earliest so that I can guide you ahead

Stay blessed!'

We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.

We are putting a formal closure to your application. You can feel free to re-apply when you are ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
