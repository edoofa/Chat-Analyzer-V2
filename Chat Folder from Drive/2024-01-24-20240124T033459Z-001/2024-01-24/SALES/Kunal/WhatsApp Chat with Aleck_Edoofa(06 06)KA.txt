Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests and passion,  you are eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Arts in Political Science*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
22/06/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 341 7885: Ok explain
22/06/23, 2:42 pm - Kunal: *Bachelor of Arts in Political Science* is a 3-year undergraduate program in Arts and Social Science

BA Political Science degree holders, usually, find employment in a variety of sector like Public Service, Media, Education, Social Service, Publishing, Politics etc.
Politics has been one of the sustaining features of governance across civilization. A Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, apart from dealing with Political theories, also teaches about various systems of governance, economics, sociology, international relations, global politics, psychology etc.

The course gives an idea about how a nation runs and teaches how to interpret and analyze political systems. This course is ideal for students who have an interest in learning the mechanisms of the administrative aspects of a country. The course not just deals with modern political scenarios but also encompasses the history of political development, various political revolutions across the world, thus helping a student learn the Political practices of countries around the world.

After a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, a student has multiple academic options available in India. A student vying for higher studies can opt for an MA in Political Science which is a Master’s degree in Political Science. A student can also opt for an MA in International Relations.

Other than the traditional MA options, there is the option to pursue studies in Law. Students who wish to study law after graduation in political science have the option of 3 year LLB course which is offered to students after graduation in any stream.

The option to do an MBA is also open for students after BA in Political Science. In MBA too, there are multiple options like MBA in HRM, MBA in Marketing etc.

*Career Prospects*

The students have a lot of BA Political Science job opportunities once they complete this course. Some of the major job profiles are:

*Public Administrator*    
As a Public Administrator, BA Political Science graduates can utilize their knowledge to inform policy decisions and administer those decisions effectively.

*Academician*    
Those who choose to pursue further education can, in turn, become lecturers and professors.

*Archivist*    
A political archivist is responsible for assessing, collecting, processing, organizing, maintaining and preserving important records which possess long term value.

*Correspondent*    
A political correspondent is responsible for relaying important political events primarily for news channels.

*Political Content Writer*    
A Political content writer’s job is to write about various contemporary and historical political issues majorly for online media outlets for news and information.

*Consultant*    
A political consultant is a professional who helps an organization make politically informed choices. Their knowledge about political philosophy comes in handy in such roles.

*Manager*    
BA in Political Science helps to understand the broad administrative system in India, thus making them the right fit for managerial positions.

*Subject Matter Expert*    
Nowadays many IT and knowledge processing companies require subject matter experts for different subjects.

*PR Executive*    
Public Relations is also a good option as exposure to political practices also acquaints one with culture and social systems of a place and hence making them ideal for a role as Public Relations executive.\

11/07/23, 8:41 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I am expecting a response from your side
May I know if you are available for the session?
11/07/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 341 7885: Yes am available now
11/07/23, 8:46 am - Kunal: Good to hear from you
11/07/23, 8:46 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Aleck with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/07/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 341 7885: Its me
11/07/23, 8:47 am - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
11/07/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 341 7885: Its good with these opportunity he will get
11/07/23, 8:48 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
11/07/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 341 7885: Understandable
11/07/23, 8:49 am - Kunal: Indeed
So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
11/07/23, 9:02 am - Kunal: Have you gone through this, please?
11/07/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 341 7885: Yes
11/07/23, 9:04 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
11/07/23, 9:04 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/07/23, 9:04 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/07/23, 9:19 am - Kunal: Shall we proceed ahead, please?
11/07/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 341 7885: Yes
11/07/23, 9:20 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/07/23, 9:20 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/07/23, 9:20 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/07/23, 9:41 am - Kunal: Have you gone through them, please?
11/07/23, 10:27 am - Kunal: Are we still connected?
12/07/23, 9:13 am - Kunal: Good morning 
Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives.
