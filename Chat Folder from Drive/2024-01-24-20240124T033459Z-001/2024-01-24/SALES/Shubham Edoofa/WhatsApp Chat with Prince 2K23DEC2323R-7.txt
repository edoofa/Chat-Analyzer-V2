8/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

8/1/24, 4:17 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes the steps are clear
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
8/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:32 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes i fully understand
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes we are available
8/1/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - +27 78 130 8695: yes you may
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you -
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
8/1/24, 5:21 PM - +27 78 130 8695: We will be available in the next hour
8/1/24, 5:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Please do let me know once you have gone through the videos.
8/1/24, 5:26 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Sure I will let you know once I'm done
8/1/24, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear.
8/1/24, 6:33 PM - +27 78 130 8695: In the first video they are explaining how excited the former Edoofans are after completing their studies at their several universities, and they wake up every day with a piece of mind and smiles on their faces through their experiences that they get because of their Edoofa program

Edoofa also helps with the students when they find it difficult to cope in different circumstances they provide councilors to help them through

I also learnt that Edoofa program digs deep in finding good and better universities for students as they are some universities that are not up to standards, that are after money but not education
But Edoofa takes time to look for the better and best universities for their students
8/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
8/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
8/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/1/24, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/1/24, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
8/1/24, 6:49 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Wow thank you so much you have perfectly summarize it
8/1/24, 6:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
8/1/24, 6:53 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes we are on the same page
8/1/24, 6:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
8/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
8/1/24, 7:04 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Tomorrow at 18:00 cat

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
8/1/24, 7:19 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Thank you so much have a blessed night to
8/1/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear!
9/1/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prince, Wishing you a good day!
9/1/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
9/1/24, 7:10 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes
9/1/24, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have you completed the above task ?
9/1/24, 7:30 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes I have
9/1/24, 7:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please share your response with us
9/1/24, 7:39 PM - +27 78 130 8695: 2) UI/UX refers to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, which are important aspects of digital design. UI design focuses on the look and feel of a digital product, while UX design focuses on how users interact with and experience that product. In today's digital world, UI/UX design is essential to creating products that are easy to use, intuitive, and engaging.

3) The OSI  model is a reference model for communication between devices in a computer network. It's organized into seven layers:
- Physical layer
- Data link layer
- Network layer
- Transport layer
- Session layer
- Presentation layer

4) Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow, so that it can perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a set of rules for how the instructions should be written. There are many different programming languages, but some of the most popular ones today include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. These languages are used in a variety of applications because they each have different strengths.

5) Compilers and interpreters are both types of programs that convert source code  into machine code . The main difference is in how they perform this conversion. A compiler converts the entire program into machine code before it's run, while an interpreter converts the code one line at a time while it's being run.
9/1/24, 7:39 PM - +27 78 130 8695: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 7:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us regarding the academic questions. I would like to know if you have completed the SOP form?
9/1/24, 7:49 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Unfortunately I have not completed the SOP form as yet
9/1/24, 7:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I the reason dear
9/1/24, 8:04 PM - +27 78 130 8695: We were experiencing power outage electricity only came back a few hours ago
9/1/24, 8:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, May I know if you can complete it now?
9/1/24, 8:09 PM - +27 78 130 8695: I will complete it tomorrow and send it to you
9/1/24, 8:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm. I hope that is fine?
9/1/24, 8:12 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes that would be great
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have a good day ahead!
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Thank you so much
9/1/24, 8:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear
10/1/24, 10:49 AM - +27 78 130 8695: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prince, I hope you are doing well.
10/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
10/1/24, 2:14 PM - +27 78 498 2719: Good afternoon
10/1/24, 2:15 PM - +27 78 130 8695: We may move forward
10/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
10/1/24, 2:19 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes the preparations are going well so far
10/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
10/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
10/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes that is true
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
10/1/24, 2:36 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes that is true
10/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
10/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
10/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
10/1/24, 2:44 PM - +27 78 130 8695: Yes that is correct
10/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to$1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
10/1/24, 2:59 PM - +27 78 498 2719: Here i am not understanding
10/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: What is the doubt ?
10/1/24, 3:24 PM - +27 78 498 2719: How will you apply to university's without princes final year results
10/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27784982719 We will submit the needed documents to the university such as 12th grade admission letter.
10/1/24, 3:40 PM - +27 78 498 2719: So there don't need the final results
10/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Not yet @27784982719, But as soon as the results are announced you are advised to share them with us please.
10/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
10/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
10/1/24, 3:52 PM - +27 78 498 2719: Okay
10/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
10/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350 . The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
10/1/24, 4:01 PM - +27 78 498 2719: Noted
10/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
10/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/1/24, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As I was looking forward for your response, I want to share that my working hours are over. Hence, I would like to schedule our session with you tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prince, Wishing you a good day!
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
11/1/24, 2:04 PM - +27 78 498 2719: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that the results are coming next week on Thursday and you want to continue with the discussion once the results are out. But I would like to know why is that you want to wait for results ?
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - +27 78 498 2719: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Truly Understand @27784982719, <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Although, I want to share that we can move ahead with our discussion as they are certain benefits which I would like to share with you

May we please have a refund for the money that we paid $200 as we can not go any further... thank you
11/1/24, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @27656305560 , I understand that you are concerned about the funds due to which you are considering that you will not be able to afford this scholarship. As it has been only a month since you initiated the admission process for your education abroad, and within this short span, you are contemplating abandoning everything you have worked for.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

23/1/24, 6:54 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I see you have gone through my messages earlier but did not respond back, *please If there is something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with your process, then I would request you to come forward and address the same with me here in the group so that I can provide you with a solution to cater to your issues and guide you with your admissions procedures.*

Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
