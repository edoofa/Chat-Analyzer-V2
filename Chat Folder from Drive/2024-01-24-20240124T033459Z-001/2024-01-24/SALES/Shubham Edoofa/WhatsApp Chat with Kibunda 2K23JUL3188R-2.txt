I hope you are doing well. I am *Ms. Kirti, an admissions officer here at Edoofa.* I will be assisting you in your journey ahead. I was able to go through your discussion with Mr. Milan and noticed that your main challenge is regarding the quality of the university may I know if my understanding so far is correct?
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - +260 96 9739802: Yes it is and you have been ignoring us why
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We have not been ignoring you @260969739802 and I can completely understand what you must have felt as a parent. Kindly excuse us for that. We as an organization were involved in a really big event that was organised for our Edoofians. With great excitement and pride, I want to share that the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
