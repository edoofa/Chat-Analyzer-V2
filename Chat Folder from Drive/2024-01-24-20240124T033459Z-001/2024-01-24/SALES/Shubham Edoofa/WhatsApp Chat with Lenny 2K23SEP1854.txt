16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

19/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
19/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
19/1/24, 9:24 AM - +27 84 448 3976: Yes they are happy with the results

23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I am doing great please
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?
23/1/24, 12:59 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I am not aware of that
23/1/24, 1:41 PM - Shubham Edoofa: So Lenny, Just before I connected with you, I had a word with our Head Admissions Officer, Ms Vilsha and was quite taken aback by the news your application is still under process despite the passing of the months since we last interacted. You being one of my favourite students, I was intrigued to know the reasons behind the same and I wish to guide you in the very best way possible.
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - +27 84 448 3976: It is because of the challenge of finances
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed about this issue,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 2:07 PM - +27 84 448 3976: We are still organizing for the money
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - +27 84 448 3976: No
23/1/24, 7:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Please why are you replying so late, I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/1/24, 8:19 PM - +27 84 448 3976: I think it's network problem
