A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

23/1/24, 8:33 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Can you help me understand that why do you specifically want to pursue Social Work?
23/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 71 641 5156: The reason why l want to study social work is because l  desire to make a positive impact: Many people are driven by a genuine passion for helping others and making a positive difference in their lives. So l believe that social work provides an avenue to create meaningful change and improve the well-being of vulnerable individuals or communities.

Social work is considered a humanitarian profession, often centered around promoting social justice, equality, and human rights. So by pursueing  this field l will have a deep sense of empathy and a strong desire to support those who may face adversity or social injustices.
I also have interest in addressing social issues: and what l mean by this is that : Social work offers an opportunity to work directly with various social issues such as poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, mental health, child welfare, and substance abuse. Those who want to contribute to solving these complex problems in society often find social work as a fulfilling option. So that's the reason why l want to do social work
23/1/24, 9:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted Hilton,
It's wonderful to hear about your passion and motivation for pursuing a career in social work. Your desire to make a positive impact, contribute to social justice, and address pressing social issues aligns well with the goals and values of the sociology profession.
23/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
23/1/24, 9:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Hilton, first of all, I would like to help you understand that in India and many other countries Social work is considered a very niche course, and hence the amount of scholarship percentage offered for this course is very limited, that's the reason we do not cover this course under our scholarship, But we do understand that this field of work like Sociology/Social Work is very reputable and hence we recommend our students to pursue *BA in Sociology*, as globally considering this course is highly marketable, The reason being you would have more job opportunities plus you will also be able to fulfil you goal of bringing a positive impact to the society.
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay it's okay l can do a BA in Sociology
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Sociology is a broader academic discipline that studies society, human behaviour, and social institutions.

While sociology provides valuable insights into social structures and dynamics.
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Both sociology and social work play important roles in addressing social issues, Sociology tends to focus on understanding the broader social context, developing theories and emphasizes practical interventions and support for individuals and communities.
23/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay l understand
23/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa: So Shall I brief you about this course in detail?

23/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ain't number 1 and two the same
23/1/24, 10:19 AM - Shubham Edoofa: You will need to write an email, To academicboard@edoofa.com, And please do the same at the earliest, So that I can continue with your academic process ahead on priority
23/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay
23/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 71 641 5156: I have sent the email
23/1/24, 10:42 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted Hilton, In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes that's accurate
23/1/24, 10:46 AM - Shubham Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission, our main focus is on completing your scholarship application and sharing it with universities tailored to your chosen course, endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.

As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.

If multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right?
23/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes it's not right
23/1/24, 10:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay understood
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Shubham Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes that's true
23/1/24, 11:00 AM - Shubham Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes we are
23/1/24, 11:12 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 641 5156: So the registration fee is subtracted from the $2800
23/1/24, 11:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Yes please, that is correct!
23/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay understood
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - Shubham Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/1/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 11:41 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/1/24, 11:42 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Ohh okay understood
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Hilton, Please I can see that your parents are not following this discussion, Can yoou ask them to go through the same as well?
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay l will
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 71 641 5156: They are both at work at the moment so they will do so when done
23/1/24, 1:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted please, And when do they come back from work Hilton?
23/1/24, 5:13 PM - +44 7471 319300: Good day
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +44 7471 319300: I understand
23/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
23/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 71 641 5156: Thank you
