I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
10/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents today at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
10/1/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐ <This message was edited>

10/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nathaniel,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
10/1/24, 6:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 10:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
11/1/24, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nathaniel,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?

13/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 405 0858: I think it's fair to calculate the schoolarship percentage on results
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nathaniel.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing Nathaniel's results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
15/1/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand since your results came out yesterday only the re-evaluation will not be possible right now as it takes time since the university has already offered you a scholarship, plus considering that you have the endowment benefits right which is the $150 grant if you tend to wait for re-evaluation and continue to move forward with the standard admission process you will end up losing the endowment benefits. So my advice regarding your admission offer is to understand the letter better now because I will never want you to miss out on the endowment benefit.
16/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 77 405 0858: Morning,l hope I have find you well,allow me to ask a question like this.Is Galgotias the only university in India?,is the owner of Microsoft attend this university ?. I feel betrayed.you would have given 3 option for univerties so that a student can choose the likes of LPU,CHAMG and PDM.However there no problem.may I have the address of your offices here in Zimbabwe.
16/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 77 405 0858: I have two 2 kids who have enrolled with Edoofa you both offer them this Galgotias.l feel bettrayed your promises are never met up to now.
