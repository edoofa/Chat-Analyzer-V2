16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tukiya

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 5:05 PM - +260 97 7440395: Good Evening... Thank you. The Grade 12 results unfortunately are not out yet. We will be sure to share them once they have been published
16/1/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, May I know when are your results announcing ?
16/1/24, 7:32 PM - +260 97 7440395: There is no indication as to when exactly the results will be out
16/1/24, 7:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please do let me know once you have received your results
16/1/24, 7:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good day ahead
