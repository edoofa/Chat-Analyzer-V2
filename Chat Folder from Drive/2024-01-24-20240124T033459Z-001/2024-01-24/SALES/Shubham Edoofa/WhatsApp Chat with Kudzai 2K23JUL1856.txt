16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I already shared the results with you
17/1/24, 12:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

It is alright, please. Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 12:11 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright I even paid the agent fee of $350 last year
17/1/24, 12:12 PM - +27 74 685 8686: I’m only waiting for you to get me an admission at a university as you had promised before 
And if you fail I would kindly ask you to refund me the $350 I paid
17/1/24, 12:13 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Because since last year I’ve been waiting
17/1/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, I believe you have already received an offer letter and we did not have a smooth conversation with you after 15th November because you had your reasons and I understand those completely. And now Mr. Shubham will be connecting with you on Monday to assist you further.
17/1/24, 12:18 PM - +27 74 685 8686: Alright I will be waiting
22/1/24, 9:44 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Good Day, Kudzai
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy.
