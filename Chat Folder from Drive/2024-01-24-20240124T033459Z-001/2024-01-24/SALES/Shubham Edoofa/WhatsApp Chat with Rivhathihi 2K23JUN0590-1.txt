I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

Thats true
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted, So let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Commerce and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes it is correct sir
23/1/24, 3:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission, our main focus is on completing your scholarship application and sharing it with universities tailored to your chosen course, endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
In the event that multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right ?
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Well noted sir
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes it is not feasible
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Well noted sir
23/1/24, 7:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*
