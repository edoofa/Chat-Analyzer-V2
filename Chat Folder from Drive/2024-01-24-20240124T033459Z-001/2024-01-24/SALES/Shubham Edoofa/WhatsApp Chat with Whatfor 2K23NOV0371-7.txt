I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

21/12/23, 8:34 AM - +263 77 377 7041: Yes!Yes!Yes!We appreciate

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU university admission formalities.
21/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Whatfor ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 3:37 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Good afternoon sorry for late reply there was heavy rain,I'm happy I received the offer letter and I went through it but my father is at work but he is going to go through it.
21/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I understand please. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky thank you
21/12/23, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
21/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 71 874 1694: 1.  $975
2.  3 years
3.  $200
4.  $700
21/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
21/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
21/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
21/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
21/12/23, 4:12 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky I understand
21/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
21/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether they wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 4:18 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes I am clear
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
21/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes I understand
21/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @~asherwandirai, we will soon discuss about the payment please. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3rd, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 4:34 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 4:52 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 5:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 5:21 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky thank you
21/12/23, 5:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 5:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 5:25 PM - +263 71 874 1694: You can share them with me
21/12/23, 5:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/12/23, 5:27 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Thank you
21/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263718741694 Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Yes
21/12/23, 5:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 5:37 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Can I please know documents that are needed or those I need to carry  when I'm coming to India
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263718741694 Please don't worry as you will be assisted with you all the requirements which will be needed when you will arrive in India.
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

21/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky thank you
21/12/23, 6:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by Saturday at 12:00 PM and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky
21/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
21/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky thank you
21/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome
30/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Whatfor,

As we approach the end of the year, I want to take a moment to reflect on all that we have accomplished together. Despite the challenges you faced, you persevered and continued to learn and grow. I am so proud of you for your hard work and dedication towards your Higher Education. 

As we look ahead to the new year, I want to wish you all a very happy and healthy 2024. May this year bring you joy, success, and fulfillment in all that you do. May you continue to learn and grow, and may you never lose your passion for knowledge and discovery.
30/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
30/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Thank you
30/12/23, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear @263718741694
2/1/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Whatfor, Wishing you a good day!

As per the discussion that we had here earlier, you were planning to make the payment of your registration fee before 3rd January, however, I have not received an update from your side on that.

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
3/1/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Whatfor, I hope I find you in best spirit.

Over the past couple of days, I have been looking forward for your response so that we can have a discussion regarding your offer letter and move forward with your admission journey. I am sure you are well aware that the university has given you a due date to complete the registration process. Since, your due date was for yesterday, I am reaching out to you in order to understand the current situation so that I can update the university officials accordingly.

It seems that my earlier messages have not been able to get through, I believe something has been bothering you because of which you have not been able to get back to us. Is my understanding right here ?
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Sorry for replying late my father read the terms of the offer letter and it said the correct result must be send before 31 December 2023 yet our results are not yet out they will be out in February and he says what if I don't make it while the money is already paid what happens.
3/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you had a doubt about this, But I am not understanding why you have not shared this with us ?
3/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 874 1694: As for me I don't have doubts I'm begging my daddy to do this for me I  want to come I can't quite after all this journey for my education
3/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263718741694. I would like to connect with your father so that we can assist him, Could you please ask him to connect with us?
3/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 874 1694: Oky
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Good Afternoon
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Hello Ashi
3/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773777041, How are you doing?
3/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Not too bad but on confusion about the educational journey of my daughter there is some where I did not catch up but to realize it after reading the university offer letter many times that I am like playing gabbling because the O level results are not yet out but I am pumping out unrefund able monies if the results come out on the other side which I don't know what passes the university wants I had the mind that we first wait for the results then we play according to the results we know all henceforth the game is tricky may you try to open it for me again
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Are you there Ashi
3/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773777041 I appreciate that you have keep this transparency in sharing your concern with us. As you have mentioned that you want to wait for the O level results I want to share that this opportunity might not be available till that period. 

While I understand your thoughts, I hope you remember the Endowment Benefits we share with you, for the better let me share them with you again.
3/1/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case, Whatfor did not receive the good results in the O level, You have the endowment benefit,
3/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Reappear in O Level*

Now here if you decide to go with this option, which is reappearing in the O Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your degree then.
3/1/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Well but what like what is on the ground Watt is waiting for her O level results by end of February 2024 and above and she comes out with flying passes what happens whynot joining batch July-August 2024
3/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773777041 If you want to wait for O level results you can wait but in that case the endowment benefits will not be available for you. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. In case you want to wait for O level results, you may end up missing this opportunity. 

Hence, we have came across with these benefits for our student. I hope you understand?
3/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Do you refund the $350
3/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The enrollment fee you've paid is refundable only if, as an organization, we fail to assist you in securing a scholarship opportunity for your higher education in India. However, this is not the case for you, as you have received a scholarship offer letter from LPU University, making you ineligible for a refund according to our policy.

While I am more than willing to explain this policy in detail, I am also concerned about your sudden contemplation of giving up on Whatfor educational plans. I would appreciate understanding your situation better.
3/1/24, 4:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Being your admission officer, I am concerned as  you are contemplating abandoning everything you've worked for. Am I correct in assuming that your desire is to pursue education abroad, but I am not understanding what is the exact concern here?
3/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Well thank you for your consideration s is there additional time for payment to those failed to catch up the deadline like myself
3/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263773777041, We always help our students and Whatfor has always been dedicated to this journey. I will do my best to help you with the payment plan. In that case, you need to share your concern with me so that I can assist you in the best possible way. I hope you understand?
3/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Yes I understand Ashi which is the best possible way of payment Ashi when at the level like this(deadline already clocked)
3/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that the deadline to complete the registration process is crossed. To assist you further, May I know by when you can make the payment for the registration process ?
3/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 77 377 7041: 25/01/2024
3/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, May I know the amount you will be able to pay by 25th of January ?
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 377 7041: $600
3/1/24, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will have conversation with the university officials to tackle the challenge, In an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. Hence, I would like to know if you can make the payment of $100 by tomorrow?
3/1/24, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This minimum payment will allow us to present the strong case
3/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 377 7041: Okay
3/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Will you be able to make the payment by tomorrow ?
3/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 377 7041: If l manage to squeeze to reach the bank yes for the coming three days we are busy preparing and doing stock taking at our job
3/1/24, 5:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263773777041, Please try to make the payment tomorrow and if you need any help please do let me know.
