I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - +260 96 9875838: But our results are not yet out sir

23/1/24, 11:29 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Natasha, I recall that earlier you opted for *B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering)*, So can you help me understand the following:
1. To which field do you want to change your course, and also specify the course.
2. Why do you wish to change your course?
23/1/24, 11:36 AM - +260 96 9875838: I wish to change because the percentage of the course is too small
23/1/24, 11:36 AM - +260 96 9875838: And I would like to go for civil engineering
23/1/24, 11:46 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted and I totally understand that, You are certainly eligible for course change, and can be provided with a higher quantum of scholarship as well, Natasha <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - +260 96 9875838: My parents said that they couldn’t afford the expenses for the aerospace engineering course.
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted please!
23/1/24, 11:49 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted please, So did you manage to research about this course as well?
23/1/24, 11:50 AM - +260 96 9875838: Yes I did
23/1/24, 11:50 AM - +260 96 9875838: And I’m still researching
23/1/24, 11:52 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course in detail?
23/1/24, 11:52 AM - +260 96 9875838: Yes
23/1/24, 11:52 AM - +260 96 9875838: I also have a challenge though and I would like it for you to help me
23/1/24, 12:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Please share the same with me?
23/1/24, 12:27 PM - +260 96 9875838: Last time I was also given an option to do law with 90% scholarship but then I also want to engineering now I’m just stuck
23/1/24, 12:28 PM - +260 96 9875838: Because the law opportunity covers almost the whole scholarship <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 12:28 PM - +260 96 9875838: I’m just stuck.
23/1/24, 12:28 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I understand Natasha, So do you wish to Pursue Law then?
23/1/24, 12:29 PM - +260 96 9875838: That’s where I’m stuck
23/1/24, 12:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa: So Natasha, I would like to understand what are your career motivation here, As you can opt for either of the two courses, Law will definitely provide you with a higher quantum of scholarship as compared to Civil Engineering,
23/1/24, 12:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Natasha, I understand that ensuring a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for your brighter future
23/1/24, 12:37 PM - +260 96 9875838: If I do civil engineering how much percentage do I get???
23/1/24, 12:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Natasha, I cannot disclose the final scholarship percentage as of yet the final scholarship percentage will be decided once you finalize the university you wish to study at. After this, our Academic Board and the University you choose their scholarship grant committee will then sit together and discuss your performance academically, in the Edoofa Eligibility process and then decide your final percentage!

*Please understand that you are not studying for a scholarship*, You are studying for personal interest, Please be rest assured that I will assist you to the best of my abilities to provide you with a higher quantum of scholarship irrespective of the course you opt for.
23/1/24, 12:56 PM - +260 96 9875838: Okay
23/1/24, 12:56 PM - +260 96 9875838: Can I give you my decision tomorrow??
23/1/24, 12:57 PM - +260 96 9875838: So that I can speak to my mother
23/1/24, 1:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Surely Natasha, I would appreciate it if she came online and attended the session. So that I can clear her queries as well during the session.
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - +260 96 9875838: Her phone got spoilt so she’s not available at the moment
