I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.
