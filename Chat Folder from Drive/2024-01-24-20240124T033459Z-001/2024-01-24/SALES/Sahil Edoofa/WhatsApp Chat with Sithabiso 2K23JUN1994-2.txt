I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 572 3973: Good day

Lam not sure if I will get admission with those results or I have to retake A level or re consider taking an option course which I don't have at the moment.Honestly lam in a state of confusion.
My parents said they will wait for Edoofa schoolarship program outcome and take it from there but meanwhile I should be thinking of what I want

22/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you understand that with these results it won't be possible for you to even get admission in Zimbabwe but bein your counselor, my primary concern is to prevent you from losing an entire academic year, which could have long-term implications on your employability.
