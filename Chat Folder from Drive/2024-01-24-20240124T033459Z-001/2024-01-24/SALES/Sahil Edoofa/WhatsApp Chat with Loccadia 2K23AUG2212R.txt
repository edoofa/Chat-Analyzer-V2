15/1/24, 1:00 AM - +263 71 611 2479: Good evening mentors and directors it's Loccadia l will like to sincerely apologies for not being available for my sessions the reasons is l was away from home and l had lost my phone so l had anticipated by now l would have bought a new phone but the finances are not bulancing.

Now moving forward  l managed to pay the enrollment fee which was 350$ but  due to serious financial imbalance at home  l failed to secure a sit at Galgotious university it was not easy  we tried all we could but things are not going so good this time around  , considering that my father is the only one working and the pay is not enough to meet our expectations it made it difficult for me to obtain the amount that was needed in such a short period of time, .
Having an opportunity to study in India has always been my dream and l was willing to put my all in it and further my education by finance is my only barrier to do so . 
The Alevel results are out and my results are as follows 

History A
Sociology A
Ndebele Language A.

I was wondering if by any chance do you offer a fully funded scholarship, also l have been meaning to ask what happens to the 350 since l have failed to raise money to secure a sit in the university .
Again l apologize for the inconveniences that I have caused by my absence THANKYOU

22/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.
