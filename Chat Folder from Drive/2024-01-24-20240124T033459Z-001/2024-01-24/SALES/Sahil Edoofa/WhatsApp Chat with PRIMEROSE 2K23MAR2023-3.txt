16/1/24, 7:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Primerose,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

Confirming our records : Primerose you chosen Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, planning to arrive in India by August 2024 right ?

23/1/24, 10:21 AM - +263 71 479 0924: Mr Sahil may I please change my course to agronomy if that's possible
23/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa: Based on your results, it seems you are currently not eligible for Agriculture/Agronomy due to the requirement of Biology as a compulsory subject in A level, which you don't fulfill. As your career counselor, I am interested in understanding your motivation for choosing this course. Additionally, considering your career aspirations, where do you see yourself after completing the course? This could involve possibilities like starting a business, pursuing a senior position in a mining sector, or even venturing into entrepreneurship.

However since she did not do biology and has these subjects.what other good options can she purse for she is a very practical person
23/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 409 5774: Agricultural economics is there such an option
23/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa: Certainly! Agricultural Economics is a field that combines principles of economics with agricultural practices. It focuses on understanding economic factors affecting agriculture, agribusiness, and rural areas.

Considering her interests and future employability aspects, here are three courses that may align well with her goals:

Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA):
BBA provides a comprehensive understanding of business principles, management, and entrepreneurship.
It equips you with skills applicable in various industries, including agriculture and agribusiness.

Bachelor in Economics:
A degree in Economics offers in-depth knowledge of economic theories, policies, and their real-world applications.
This foundation is valuable for understanding the economic dynamics of agriculture and related sectors.

Bachelor of Arts in Geography:
Geography explores spatial relationships and human-environment interactions.
In the context of agriculture, it could involve studying the geographical aspects of farming, land use, and environmental considerations.
23/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa: So which one would you like to opt ?
23/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 409 5774: Am.lost a bit Agric economics is it available
