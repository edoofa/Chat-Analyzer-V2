I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anopaishe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 610 1227: He jus collected them today hence the delay in sending them

16/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 610 1227: Anopaishe RC.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 610 1227: Thank you
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parents and Anopaishe,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 11:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Anopaishe

23/1/24, 1:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on the excellent A-level results of Anopaishe* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Anopaishe being a bright student. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help in the best possible way as I understand her calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Anopaishe!
How are you doing?
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Yes l am
23/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 354 0447: I am doing fine sir and you how are you
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear that, Anopaishe!
I am doing well by the Grace of God
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 2:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 354 0447: For now we have decided to apply to HIT and continue with this scholarship application as well
23/1/24, 2:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Anopaishe!

23/1/24, 3:04 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Anopaishe!
23/1/24, 3:04 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 77 354 0447: What might the reason be
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Yes I am very much
23/1/24, 4:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is great to hear, Anopaishe!
23/1/24, 4:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Computer Applications and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Yh it us correct very much
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 354 0447: I don't get the question 😕
23/1/24, 5:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me help you with a better understanding since you were busy with the exams while the sessions were hosted. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk ohk  am following
23/1/24, 5:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 5:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
23/1/24, 5:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk ohk l get now
23/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Yes I am very much
23/1/24, 5:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me as of now?
23/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Yes sir so in the case of the offer letter what is it that l have to offer to you so that l will be able to get a university
23/1/24, 5:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: As of now, you do not have to offer anything rather I will be recommending your application to our Academic Board. After the offer letter is shared, you are supposed to pay the registration fee as per the offer letter.
23/1/24, 5:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: You will be receiving this payment plan for the same or you can complete it in one phase itself
23/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk ohk l hear you thank you
23/1/24, 5:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask me please?
23/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Nothing much sir
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Anopaishe, I believe you recall the discussions regarding the University registration fee. It is really crucial to reserve your University seat after you receive the Offer Letter. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board to fast-track your process and recommended your application. May I know, how are the preparations towards the registration fee progressing within your family? ?
23/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 354 0447: My mother will see to it
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Anopaishe, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director, Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parent/parents about this. So shall I share the schedule for the same?
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk you can sir
23/1/24, 6:01 PM - Austin Edoofa: So shall I schedule the call at 6:30 pm CAT today?
23/1/24, 6:03 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk thank you

23/1/24, 6:05 PM - Austin Edoofa: The Program Director- Mr Abhinav Gupta Edoofa.vcf (file attached)
23/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 354 0447: Ohk will do so
