I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

16/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Getrude,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Hello Edoofa hope you are well

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Getrude
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:22 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Good day to you Mr Austin  

Thank you
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 71 682 5189: Good day Mr Austin

23/1/24, 3:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on the good A-level results of Getrude* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process while Getrude being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand Getrrude's calibre.
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: So are you actively available for a discussion now?
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - +27 62 987 3350: Yes we are
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
