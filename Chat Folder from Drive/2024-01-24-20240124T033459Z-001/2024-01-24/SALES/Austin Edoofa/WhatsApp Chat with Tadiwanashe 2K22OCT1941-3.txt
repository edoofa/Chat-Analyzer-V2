This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

8/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 244 7344: Thank you ma'am . I am happy to walk the EDOOFA journey with you. Thanks once again for your support
8/1/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to be here to support you, Tadiwanashe.
How were the New Year's holidays for you and your family?
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 244 7344: The holidays were good
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. 

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 244 7344: I have decided to grow spiritually and persue my carrier training as a robotic scientist
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 77 244 7344: I'm sorry for being unable to proceed with the admission process because I was having my final exams
9/1/24, 8:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.

May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
9/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 77 244 7344: Yes we can proceed.
Good morning
9/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you today?

9/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to know Tadiwanashe. Before we move ahead with your application process, I believe we asked you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 244 7344: Thank you so much
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 244 7344: Thanks for checking on me . I passed with flying colors

22/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 77 244 7344: Yes
22/1/24, 5:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
22/1/24, 5:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

22/1/24, 5:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 5:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 5:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments.

22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for Tadiwanashe's higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?

22/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 244 7344: Yes can start august
22/1/24, 7:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: Please note that Robotics and Automations is a major subject within Mechanical Engineering itself which means Tadiwanashe will be having practical experiences of Robotics and Automation through the course
22/1/24, 7:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is correct!
22/1/24, 7:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?

23/1/24, 9:40 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Morning Tadiwanashe and family, 

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further to your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 244 7344: Yes . The registration fee was $365
23/1/24, 9:50 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Mrs Mudondo!
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - Austin Edoofa: Please note that this is the first half of the registration fee, let me give you an example
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - Austin Edoofa: *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 9:52 AM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 9:52 AM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins
23/1/24, 9:52 AM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 244 7344: Yes
23/1/24, 10:00 AM - Austin Edoofa: Alright, at the moment, it is really crucial to reserve your University Seat with the completion of the registration fees which would be the next stage of the process. So may I know, how far is your family and you prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
23/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 244 7344: Can manage
23/1/24, 10:12 AM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted!
23/1/24, 10:14 AM - Austin Edoofa: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for your child to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that this is a big decision for your child's career I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to you and finalise the University registration process
23/1/24, 10:14 AM - Austin Edoofa: Shall I share the schedule for the same?
23/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 244 7344: Thanks so much
23/1/24, 10:45 AM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome, Please greet Mr Abhinav Gupta, Program Director at Edoofa now in his inbox to begin the call. Ensure to maintain a stable network for a video call and I wish them a fruitful discussion. I believe you have connected with him once before the enrollment too.
