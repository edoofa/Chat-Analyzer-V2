16/1/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 2:39 PM - Keshav Edoofa: Good Day, Diana
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I am your Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Austin, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online, notify on this group and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 498 7200: Good day
22/1/24, 2:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to har from you, Diana!

22/1/24, 2:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 498 7200: It was due to the exams
22/1/24, 3:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is understandable, Diana!
22/1/24, 3:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
