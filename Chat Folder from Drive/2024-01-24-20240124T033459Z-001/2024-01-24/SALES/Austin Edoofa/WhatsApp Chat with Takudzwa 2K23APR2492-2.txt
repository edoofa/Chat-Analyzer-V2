I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Edoofa Admission Team.
9/1/24, 8:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 8:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 8:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 9:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa.

Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 9:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 9:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 10:08 PM - +263 71 371 2196: Alright  thank you
22/1/24, 11:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Takudzwa
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Takudzwa
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - +260 96 9210108: Afternoon sir am ready
23/1/24, 2:37 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Mr Banwell!
I hope you are doing well

23/1/24, 2:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Takudzwa being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - +260 96 9210108: Yes am ready
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - +260 96 9210108: Takudzwa wanted to do his advanced education in ur country so am ready to pay any fees to any university
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Mr Banwell and I appreciate your support for Takudzwa!
23/1/24, 3:56 PM - +260 96 9210108: Welcome
23/1/24, 3:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - +260 96 9210108: Alright that's good
23/1/24, 4:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed!
23/1/24, 4:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - +260 96 9210108: Yes very true I know that
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 4:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
