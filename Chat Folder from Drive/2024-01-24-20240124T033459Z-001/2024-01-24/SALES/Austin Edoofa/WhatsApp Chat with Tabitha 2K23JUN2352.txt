16/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
22/1/24, 11:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parent and Tabitha,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parent and Tabitha,
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: Yes go on
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Tabitha!
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 2:48 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: The problem was I couldn't afford the university registration fee
23/1/24, 2:58 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: I was told I needed to pay an extra $750 which ofcourse minus the $150  as an eddofian benefit left a balance of $ 600 and looking at the devaluation in my country, it was a huge  burden to me
23/1/24, 3:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: I really understand the challenges, Tabitha!
I am in touch with schools ,educationists, beneficiaries and parents from Malawi due to which I am aware of the financial crisis, devaluation of Kwacha and the struggles
23/1/24, 3:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: But then I was asking to say , since I won't make it this year, can I have a refund of the enrollment fee so I register again next year??
23/1/24, 3:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: Please do not worry about the same, Tabitha
If you wish to defer to the next year, it is still possible as you continue with your EWYL program now
23/1/24, 3:54 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:14 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: So refunds are not possible?
23/1/24, 4:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: May I ask Tabita, since you will be continuing your education next year through the Edoofa Scholarship why would you think of refund when you already have the opportunity to work and earn credits?
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: We just so financially stuck, thought it could be wise to invest it somewhere and get prepared for all the requirements
23/1/24, 4:35 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: For instance, start with the passport so that next year we should just handle other requirements like the enrollment fee and the university registration fee
23/1/24, 4:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: Well Tabitha, please look at a wider picture, the initial requirement is not the passport. For the 2025 intake, you would receive more than 17 months to prepare your passport at the same time, just imagine if you invest your time wisely in the EWYL program for these many months, that would yield you a even higher benefit that may cater even the entire first year fee based on your efforts
23/1/24, 4:54 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: I know that....so refunds are not possible?
23/1/24, 4:55 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: I just have to use the same amount, next time I want to enroll?
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - Austin Edoofa: As per the refund policy, it is possible only if Edoofa fails to provide you offer letter from University
23/1/24, 5:27 PM - +265 992 34 99 23: Alright
23/1/24, 5:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: No please, since you have already enrolled, your eligibility will be valid for the next intake
