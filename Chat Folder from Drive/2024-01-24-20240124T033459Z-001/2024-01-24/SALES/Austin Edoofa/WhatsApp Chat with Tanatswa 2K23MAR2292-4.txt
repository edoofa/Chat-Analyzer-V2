I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

11/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Tanatswa. Hope you are doing well. May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
11/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 288 6038: Sorry Tanatswa was offered a job by her former school, which allows her to work and study here. So it's most likely we might reconsider the move to India as originally planned. So how do we go about the cancellation of the "Edoofa scholarship" .  .  .
11/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 288 6038: Like right she is not able to be on the platform due to work commitments
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's great to hear that Tanatswa was able to secure a job right after completing her A-level examinations. That is a remarkable accomplishment at such a young age. Please convey my congratulations to her! May I ask about the details of the job she has secured and what her future plans are for higher education?
11/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 288 6038: I will allow her to give you the details herself after work

13/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning. May I know if she was able to find time to go through my messages?
13/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 288 6038: Yes sure she dd and promised to share her thots with you, unfortunately today she is at work up 5pm. But l will remind her when she's back.
13/1/24, 10:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright ma'am, I appreciate it.
22/1/24, 11:29 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Tanatswa
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Tanatswa
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 288 6038: Well like we explained earlier that she got a job immediately after her A' level exams. That dynamic then made us reconsider a number of things including like letting her work and study locally. We advised her previous Edoofa mentor about this new development. 
Tanatswa's Father.
