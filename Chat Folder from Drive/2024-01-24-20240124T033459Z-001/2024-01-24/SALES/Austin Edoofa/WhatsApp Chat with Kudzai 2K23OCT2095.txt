16/1/24, 10:15 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Kudzai,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 10:15 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

22/1/24, 2:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parents and Kudzai
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Good day to you Sir .l hope you are doing well. 
We are all good as a family
22/1/24, 3:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: It is good to hear from you Kudzai!

22/1/24, 3:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations @263788885077 on your exemplary A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Thank you Sir . 

Yes my parents failed to pay the Registration fees then they communicated with  Mr Shivjeet  telling him about the unexpected problems that we were facing as a family . In December my mother's fashion wear staff was delayed by ZIMRA from South Africa to Zimbabwe then after that my mom's fashion wear staff came late and unfortunately some bags were missing . We were very disappointed as a family .Mr Shivjeet said that he was going to communicate with the Edoofa Scholarship team . Then we were also disappointed to hear that there will be  endowment plan for me . (I don't know if l heard well about this or l  didn't hear that part very clear ) .
22/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 888 5077: I wait for my mom to reply the second question Sir
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: Thank you for being open and sharing your challenges with me. I understand these are genuine concerns which were beyond your power!
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

22/1/24, 3:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
22/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir l do have hope and faith of pursuing my Corporate Law right . But truly speaking as a family we are not financially stable Sir as of now. I am even disappointed and l don't know what to do . Yah l can say maybe the registration fee part they can be able to pay it if they are given time Sir but what about the money for the flight expenses and visa application right  . In December my mom researched about the cost of flights from Zimbabwe to India then she said  the amount is kinda difficult to pay but she will be able to pay it but because of the unexpected problems in our family ,our lives are fluctuating Sir . In December my parents planned very well about this Edoofa Scholarship Program right .They even planned of getting me a passport before the passport fees hiked on the 1st of January 2024 but it seems as if everything went in vain Sir . <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 4:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Kudzai, please understand that we are not compelling you to continue with the Edoofa Scholarship program but I have seen many students making unwise decisions during this most crucial time of their life after A level which has led to an overall unfavourable impact on their career. *Being a career Counsellor, I wish you do not regret in future and I am here to guide you with possible ways how to receive a higher quantum(80-100% on tuition) of scholarship and even sponsorship on Accommodation thereby even self-financing your higher education.* <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir , l am understanding what you are saying and l know that this program will change my life Sir that's why l decided to pursue my Law career with Edoofa Scholarship Program . I even worked very hard on my EWYL assignments knowing that  my life is being prepared by Edoofa Scholarship Program
22/1/24, 4:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is a sheer determination and I am sure your efforts will bear fruits soon!
22/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Thank you Sir
22/1/24, 4:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 4:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: *This is also the reason total of 370+ Edoofians were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for the previous intake*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality.*I am proud to inform that there were a student from Seke 4 who you may know as your senior*

*Precious Vizharona*
22/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 888 5077: This is great indeed Sir !
22/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Yahh this is not the first time to hear this name .Maybe l am forgetting her because of time  . 

I am happy for her🎊🎊
22/1/24, 5:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is alright Kudzai!
22/1/24, 5:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 5:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
22/1/24, 6:40 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Great to know this information
22/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 78 888 5077: Go on Sir , lm now curious
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 6:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 6:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Kudzai, It is really crucial to reserve your University seat at the earliest with the completion of the registration fees which you have missed once due to genuine reasons. We are currently overwhelmed with applicants. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered this time. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
22/1/24, 11:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing from you.
22/1/24, 11:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
