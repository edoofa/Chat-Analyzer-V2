12/1/24, 5:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Esnay,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 461 6259: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 4:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa added Austin Edoofa
16/1/24, 7:12 PM - +263 77 461 6259: Okay
22/1/24, 2:43 PM - Keshav Edoofa: Good Day, Esnay 
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I am your Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Austin, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online, notify on this group and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 461 6259: Good afternoon. I am available
22/1/24, 3:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Esnay!
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Academician at Edoofa*

22/1/24, 3:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student. Can you please forward me your A-level results to guide you in the best possible way

22/1/24, 4:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Congratulations on this Exemplary results, Esnay!
22/1/24, 4:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
22/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 461 6259: I have decided to do bachelor of architectural studies honors degree
22/1/24, 5:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Esnay, at which university are you planning to do the same?
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 461 6259: You said you were going to help me once the results are out
22/1/24, 5:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: Absolutely, Esnay!
I was just cross checking your course name, it is Bachelor of Planning. I hope you recall the same
22/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 77 461 6259: Yes. But considering what I am passionate about and also putting my results into consideration, councilor sare saying I must go for architecture and make urban planning my second option
22/1/24, 5:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me please help you with the same, Esnay!
Can you please help me further on what motivates you to pursue Architectural Studies?
Also, how do you think it difference from Bachelor of Planning?
22/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 77 461 6259: It  is what I have always been passionate about and also considering how getting the degree will bring so much positive change opportunities to my community. There is no proper buildings in Murewa were I come from not even two storey hospitals school or malls. Due to rapid population growth, the township is slowly turning into a landless situation, so I think it will only be proper to put my community into consideration for I was raised by it.
22/1/24, 5:54 PM - +263 77 461 6259: To be precise, that is why I want to persue architecture
22/1/24, 6:03 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is well expressed and spoken from heart, please address the second question as well!
22/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 77 461 6259: On the second question, yes architectural studies do differ from bachelor of planning. This is because bachelor of planning focuses more on planning and allocating landform uses or where the building is to be located where as architecture focuses on the actual designing of the building
22/1/24, 6:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is a great know, Esnay and have you researched on the Academic requirements to study Architecture?
22/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 77 461 6259: Yes. Mathematics and  physics, Technical graphics, building drawing or art
22/1/24, 6:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: Have you researched on the requirements to study in India?
22/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 77 461 6259: What are the requirements
22/1/24, 6:59 PM - +263 77 268 8367: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:59 PM - +263 77 268 8367: This message was deleted
22/1/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 461 6259: From my researches here in Zimbabwe, requirements to study architecture at NUST are pure mathematics and any other subject in physics, art, building drawing, Technical drawing or design and technology
22/1/24, 7:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Esnay and please understand that the requirements vary internationally. In India, a learner needs to have Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry at A-level and needs to clear the NATA exam to qualify for Architecture
22/1/24, 8:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Let me also highlight you the Relationship between B.Plan and B.Arch:*

Complementary Skills:  Both planners and architects collaborate in urban development projects. Planners may be involved in the overall layout and organization of a city or region, while architects may focus on the design and construction of individual buildings within that framework.
Collaboration: In real-world projects, architects and planners often work together to create sustainable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing built environments. Understanding the principles and perspectives of both fields can enhance collaboration and lead to more comprehensive and integrated solutions.

In summary, B.Plan and B.Arch are related fields that contribute to the broader goal of creating well-designed and sustainable built environments. While B.Plan focuses on urban and regional planning, B.Arch is centred on the design and construction of buildings. Professionals in these fields often collaborate to shape the physical and functional aspects of our cities and communities.
22/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 461 6259: Ok
22/1/24, 9:04 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have any questions for  me as of now?
22/1/24, 9:16 PM - +263 77 461 6259: No I am good

22/1/24, 9:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 11:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing from you.
22/1/24, 11:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:41 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Morning Esnay and family, 

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further to your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 268 8367: Good morning I'm available
23/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 268 8367: Parent of Esnay
23/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 268 8367: How are you
23/1/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, I am doing well by the Grace of God
23/1/24, 10:15 AM - Austin Edoofa: How about you?
23/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 268 8367: I'm doing good
23/1/24, 10:35 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear that and I believe you have been following the sessions so far!
23/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 77 268 8367: Yes
23/1/24, 10:36 AM - Austin Edoofa: Great, Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 268 8367: I don't know
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 268 8367: Yes
23/1/24, 11:16 AM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course your child has selected for higher education is Bachelor of Planning and her intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 268 8367: Can I ask a question sir
23/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 268 8367: I heard her saying she wants to do architectural ,bachelor of planning as second option
23/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 268 8367: I was going through the conversation you had with my child yesterday this morning and I realised that studying at NUST here in Zimbabwe is cheaper than there in India yet my child will not be on a scholarship. What also got me concerned is that she is even offered the degree that she wants. So, I was thinking of you refunding me because per year the fee is around $2610 and India $3000 yet you said she is on scholarship
23/1/24, 11:36 AM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted and I had a discussion with Esnay regarding the same yesterday and have shared the requirements and relation within the courses
23/1/24, 11:37 AM - Austin Edoofa: I see this is a genuine concern, and let me address them one by one. Have you compared the course modules of Architectural Studies with that of BPlanning?
23/1/24, 11:39 AM - Austin Edoofa: Secondly, regarding the cost of education, if you recall, the cost of education in India ranges $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced through  the Edoofa Scholarship Program. So, are you looking forward to only an undergraduate degree for your child or do you wish to see her employable possessing the industry skills after graduation?
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 268 8367: NUST in Zimbabwe is cheaper as compared to your scholarship in India, so I was thinking of you refunding me $350 of the money I deposited some time back last year
