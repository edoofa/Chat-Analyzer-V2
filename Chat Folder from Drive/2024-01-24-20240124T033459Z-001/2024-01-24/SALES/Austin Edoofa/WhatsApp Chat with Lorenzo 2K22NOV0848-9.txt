29/12/23, 3:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Microbiology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes,it is.
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

29/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I think we we're on 5
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I'm not quit sure can you just enlighten me on that
29/12/23, 4:44 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Isn't it about me getting offers letters from the Universities?
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that that is correct. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes we are, proceed
29/12/23, 5:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/12/23, 5:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/12/23, 5:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
29/12/23, 6:18 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes,l am
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
29/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes,l have proceed
29/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Noted, proceed
29/12/23, 7:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 7:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 7:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes,it does
29/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
29/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Okay proceed
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 376 7496: No, proceed
29/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 77 376 7496: More information.
2/1/24, 6:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a fruitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admission process for today?
2/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes
2/1/24, 9:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to have a proper session with you to day as there were multiple calls with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
3/1/24, 3:49 AM - +263 77 376 7496: Ok
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Lorenzo.

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
3/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 376 7496: We're all good, thanks for asking
3/1/24, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
3/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes
3/1/24, 7:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
3/1/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Provide information on it
3/1/24, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
3/1/24, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
3/1/24, 9:25 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes, Noted.
4/1/24, 5:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!


I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was not available by the time you connected as it was past my available hours. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Lorenzo,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
7/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Wish you well in your doctorate persuing,Namaste🙏
8/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lorenzo,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Thank you,and nice to know you Ms.Siddhi
8/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is nice to know you as well, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I have decided to focus on the essential things only and leave the non-essentials
9/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear, dear. Prioritizing essential aspects of life is crucial for progression and success. Prioritizing involves gaining insights into what holds significance and what does not, fostering a valuable learning experience. I am looking forward for you to explore all the opportunities and adventures that lie ahead of you.
9/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 376 7496: A lot is happening and l can't talk about it now,hope you understand
9/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. May I inquire about the challenges you are facing that make it difficult for you to discuss your admission process?
9/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 376 7496: I don't have a sponsor yet
9/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's absolutely alright. Is that why you do not wish to discuss your application process or is there any other challenge that you are facing?
9/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 376 7496: That is why
9/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Lorenzo. Accommodating funds for higher education can be a tedious task. However, I believe you must be preparing for your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I guess so,
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know about the plans that you have for the same?
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I have a sponsor but l lost contact with him,so l was thinking l will approach him once the results are out
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 376 7496: But l can't rely on him because he said nothing so,l don't know yet
11/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the same. If I may ask, who was your sponsor when you first enrolled into the program, dear?
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 376 7496: My Auntie helped me pay
11/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. May I know if she was also supposed to help you sponsor your higher education as well?
11/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 376 7496: No she wasn't the one doing that,she only helped me with the enrollment fee.
11/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. However in that case, I am slightly confused as to how you were planning to finance your higher education. Could you shed some light on the matter? I am only inquiring so I can understand your situation better and provide you with the necessary help and guidance. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I told you that l was in contact with a Real Estate CEO who was kind of willing to sponsor me but l happen to lost his contact and l'm no longer in touch with him
11/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Either way l wasn't yet 100 sure that he wanted to sponsor me but he seemed like he was willing to From the conversation we had
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Correct me if I am wrong, but you enrolled in the program because you wanted to pursue higher education here in India with the best university. When you initially enrolled, you must have had a financial plan to be able to proceed with attaining your dream education with the help of Edoofa. Could you kindly share with me how you planned on financing your higher education in case the CEO of that Real Estate company did not come through?
11/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I had only plan A and that was my plan A so,,,that was it
11/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. However, during your counseling session, you mentioned that your mother is a single parent. When the counselor asked whether you could afford the university fees, you mentioned that your mother would help sponsor your dream of pursuing higher education here in India. Could you provide me with more information on that so that I can help you better?
11/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Ok,Let me tell you what l did and what we were trying to do to help me with my higher education.So l got to know of a trading which is called Forex trading and binary and Bitcoin forex trading and we invested our money because l had convinced her to do so and we actually got scammed so as of now 1 we are not in good condition in our relationship and the other thing is she now is a little bit financial strained that when we first applied she was able to but now it's a little bit hard.Thats is why ma'am.
11/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that you fell victim to a scam, dear. Scams have been a persistent issue in Africa, and it is disheartening that you also experienced it. I hope you realize the gravity of the situation. However, avoiding discussions with your mother or withholding information about your financial challenges from us won't lead to a solution, dear. It's important to understand that despite the difficulties we face, planning for the future is crucial. May I know how you are planning to move forward with your higher education plans?
11/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 77 376 7496: As of now there isn't any.
11/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 376 7496: But l'm weighing my options just maybe, maybe something may happen
13/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If I may ask, what are your options, dear?
13/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Ma'am l think l have made it clear as of now that l am short of options.and yesterday our results came out so, we'll see what happens
13/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Do you wish to proceed with the application process?

23/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Ok,noted
23/1/24, 3:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me regarding the course?
23/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Okay l got one,is it not replaceable by technology now or in the future because technology really is replacing a lot of careers?
23/1/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: Technology and biotechnology are interconnected fields that often complement each other rather than replace each other. While advancements in technology can enhance various aspects of biotechnology, it's unlikely to completely replace biotechnology career opportunities. Instead, technology can create new opportunities, streamline processes, and contribute to the growth of the biotechnology industry.

Here are a few reasons why technology is more likely to complement biotechnology rather than replace it:

Tool Development: Technology plays a crucial role in developing advanced tools and equipment used in biotechnology research and applications. These tools, such as gene editing technologies, high-throughput screening methods, and bioinformatics tools, are essential for biotechnologists to conduct their work effectively.

Data Analysis: With the increasing complexity of biological data, technology is vital for handling and analyzing large datasets generated in biotechnological research. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics in biotechnology enhances our ability to extract meaningful insights from biological information.

Automation: Technological advancements have led to increased automation in biotechnology processes. Automated systems can perform repetitive tasks more efficiently, allowing biotechnologists to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.

Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: The convergence of technology and biotechnology has led to interdisciplinary collaborations, creating opportunities for professionals with expertise in both fields. Individuals who understand both the biological and technological aspects are well-positioned to contribute to cutting-edge research and development.

Innovation and Discovery: Technology fosters innovation, enabling the development of new techniques and methodologies in biotechnology. For example, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology, emerged from the intersection of molecular biology and technology.
23/1/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: While technology enhances the capabilities of biotechnologists, it does not replace the need for biological expertise. Biotechnology careers encompass a broad range of disciplines, including molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology, which require specialized knowledge and skills.
23/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Ok,l understand.
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have other questions for me?
23/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 376 7496: As of now No, there isn't.
23/1/24, 5:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Lorenzo!
23/1/24, 5:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 5:52 PM - +263 77 376 7496: That l must pay it before a certain time etc
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Yes
23/1/24, 6:04 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Lorenzo, It is really crucial to reserve your University seat after you receive the Offer Letter. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board to fast-track your process and recommended your application. May I know, how are the preparations towards the registration fee progressing within your family?
23/1/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 376 7496: I don't know what they are planning to honestly speak, maybe they are planning something which l'm not aware of but l will see what happens.
23/1/24, 6:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: Can you please discuss this with your family and share feedback with me soon!
23/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 376 7496: She is in the group she is reading the massages so she knows what we're talking about.
23/1/24, 6:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: Alright Lorenzo, so please have a discussion with her and you can share the feedback with me
23/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Ok.
23/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 376 7496: Hello Sir l have talked with her.
23/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 78 249 3011: I'd like to introduce myself as the mother of Lorenzo Kaliwa.
I'm sorry to say that my financial situation is currently unstable. I'd like to discuss what options are available to my child, even with these challenges."
- "I know that my financial situation isn't ideal, but I'm still committed to helping my child succeed. Can we talk about ways to support them?"
- "Due to my current financial situation, I'm worried about how I can support my child's education!
