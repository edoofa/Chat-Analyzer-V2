23/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 740 4796: First, studying in India can definitely have a positive impact on my career as India is a rapidly growing economy, and there are many opportunities for students and professionals in a wide range of fields. In addition, India has a diverse and vibrant culture, which can be a valuable experience for students looking to expand their horizons.

As for aiming to achieve career aspirations from studying in India, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly l should focus on what l want to achieve as more effort would be required.
23/01/24, 10:33 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Ruramai. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 740 4796: No we aren't aware
23/01/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: let me brief you about the same.
23/01/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 10:49 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 10:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 10:49 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
23/01/24, 4:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
