I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your every term fee, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do (Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?

22/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 728 8894: My name is Shallom  Shumba  . I aged 19 . I did my primary school at Saint Judes Primary in Nyazura .I went to Mavhudzi High school since form one till I finished my A level . I was a prefect when I was in o level and I became the school headgirl at A level . Our fees was not constant it ranged from 350 - 450 US per term  . I was a science student and I'm good  academically but while at school I faced some challenges hence I couldn't produce the right results though I didn't fail but I believe I could have done better  . I would like to study electronics and electrical engineering . 
I'm a person who loves order and I try to perfect everything that I do . It comes as a problem when I'm working with people who do not put in the same effort as I am and I hate that . I work well as part of team provided we all put in the same effort to do the job  . If not this becomes bad on my side as I tend to do everything by myself till it is perfect and at times I end up getting consequences as other parts of my life end up not getting enough attention.
I work well with time .
I don't do well under pressure my mind seems to stop working . Im afraid of failing and disappointing not only myself but my family so I push myself to my limits to insure that it doesn't happen .
I hate crowds , I love my circle small that way I know everyone around me without fear of being backstabbed .
I easily get attached to people that's also another reason why I don't like too many people because I'm afraid at  times I'll care about people who wish bad things upon me .
Well growing up I lived with my mom she's
22/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I live with my grandparents , in Nyazura and at times I visit my Mother in Rusape . My grandmother aged 55 is a house wife  and my grandfather aged 75 is a pensioner of national railways of Zim . I have one sibling (female ) doing grade 5 .She also leaves with my grandparents .My mother is self employed . She ended school at form four .
22/01/24, 2:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to know about you and your family, Shumba
22/01/24, 2:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on what exactly you mean by Self-employed?

22/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Looking at the fee hikes in Zimbabwe recently  it seems as though it's almost the same thing

22/01/24, 6:17 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Well in five years I believe I would be in the industry working for at an automobile company or a company that deals with producing different cellphones or appliances gaining more experience after some time with the aim of becoming independent some day producing my own thing . If I get into Edoofa it will enable me to achieve my dream by enrolling me in a university where I'll have all the knowledge I need with a world wide recognized degree also it'll help in finding a job at a company where I'll gain more experience in my field such that when I decide to start my own company in my country I will be guaranteed that I will not fail
22/01/24, 6:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Shumba

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I am willing . I know it's not going to be an easy journey but I believe that all I need is focus ony final destination and endurance as it will get tough along way and faith that I can do it
22/01/24, 6:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Firstly in my country due to the shortage of  universities as compared to the amount of students that would have set and passed the examinations there's stiff competition on the program that I would want to do like right now I have 10 points but because there will be many students who applied for it they raise to 13 points and above the electrical engineering   . Also since our country is still developing for the practicals one cannot get enough  knowledge practically as most industries are closed down and some may be far or too expensive to access . After one is done with their degree program you get into a situation where you go job hunting as there are few industries and many graduates while outside it will be easy to get a job once you are done and also as one would have learnt at one of the best universities  your chances to a good paying job is guaranteed due to the skills that one would have acquired
22/01/24, 6:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 77 728 8894: In developing my country I'll volunteer to go into the universities and share  my knowledge to  students  who would be  interested I'll be willing to share my knowledge with them as it takes more than one person to develop a country that way those I'd have shared my knowledge with can also use it and also reach out to others as well
22/01/24, 6:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Shumba, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I agree
22/01/24, 6:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes true
22/01/24, 6:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

22/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yeah a bit of it
22/01/24, 7:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Shumba, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
22/01/24, 7:07 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 1) well since we would engage with experts and high qualified lecturers in our field practically , studying in India would be good as I'll get to learn from the best .
2) I aim to make sure to grasp each and every teaching that I get and practicals that we would do studying and being focused so that nothing passes me
22/01/24, 7:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Shumba. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 7:09 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I could only guess that it will be quite expensive
22/01/24, 7:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of education, please.
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes please
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/01/24, 7:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
22/01/24, 7:14 pm - +263 77 728 8894: It is
22/01/24, 7:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Shumba what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 7:24 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Can you tell me more about the Earn  While  You Learn Program
22/01/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
22/01/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
22/01/24, 7:40 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes a lot . I believe I will benefit a lot as I would get exposure on may aspects and also being independent even before I'm done with my degree program
22/01/24, 7:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/01/24, 7:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/01/24, 7:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/01/24, 7:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
22/01/24, 7:55 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 2
22/01/24, 7:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Shumba, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 7:59 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I am
22/01/24, 8:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 1500-2250
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
22/01/24, 8:14 pm - +263 77 728 8894: It's good
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes please
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/01/24, 8:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood it properly?
22/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I have
22/01/24, 8:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
22/01/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Well from what I have understood Edoofa makes the educational funds become barrable as a student can do the Earn While You Learn Program and if they put in a lot of effort and seeking mentorship till they are good they can earn money to pay for their fees and reduce the load from their parents . Edoofa helps one gain skill while at it gain money which would help to save as well . Edoofa's aim in finances is that the students should be able to balance both and earn money and encourage learners to become innovative . Edoofa gets you in touch with CEOs of companies and you get to advertise and attending sessions regularly also seeking guidance one gets paid accoe to how they are working
22/01/24, 8:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood everything properly?
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I have
22/01/24, 8:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Shumba and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
22/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I have
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/01/24, 8:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/01/24, 8:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/01/24, 8:42 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I do
22/01/24, 8:43 pm - +263 77 728 8894: My battery is about to die can we continue tomorrow
22/01/24, 8:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263777288894 @263778106011 , Hope you are doing well.
23/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
23/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 728 8894: Greetings 
We are well thank you
23/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood till here, shall we continue?
23/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 728 8894: Ok
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 728 8894: So the registration fee will be a part of the annual fee
23/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 728 8894: Will the remaining fee get paid by the student once in India or it can be paid from Zimbabwe while the student is already there .Can the remaining fee be reduced as the learner does the EWYL program
23/01/24, 11:55 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
23/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 728 8894: We are
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Ok thank you

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Wednesday on “24-01-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

23/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 728 8894: You too thank you
23/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
