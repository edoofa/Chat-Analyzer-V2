22/01/24, 6:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am happy that you have an inclination towards the Medical field. 

Well, Medical Science is a very important domain and the backbone of the human population. 
So in order to qualify for it there are certain eligibility criteria. 

It is compulsory that a student has Physics, chemistry and Biology for the same. 

Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform that you are not eligible for some of the Medical Science courses related Medical Doctor,Surgeon,Nursing,Pharmacy,Physiotherapy but considering your interest there are similar courses from Medical Field itself which you are eligible for such as
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

*Bachelor of Science in nutrition and dietetics*

Would you like me to explain these programs for you?
22/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes please
22/01/24, 6:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know which course aligns with you so that I can brief you about the same?
22/01/24, 6:54 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Microbiology
22/01/24, 6:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
22/01/24, 6:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like you to go through the course properly and understand it, and inform me once done.
22/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 77 531 7234: I'm done

22/01/24, 7:48 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Establishing a well equipped research center where students can  come doing their research work
22/01/24, 7:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Tanyaradzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes, I do agree and I believe Edoofa has a conducive environment to nurture me

22/01/24, 8:11 pm - +263 77 531 7234: I understood
22/01/24, 8:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Tanyaradzwa, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
22/01/24, 8:28 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Studying in India will implement a positive impact on my career because India has a robust education system from renowned institutions with quality education and research as well as global recognition and career prospects as witnessed by the number of CEOs of international companies like Microsoft and Nokia to name a few
22/01/24, 8:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tanyaradzwa. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 8:31 pm - +263 77 531 7234: I will achieve my career aspirations by capitalizing on the research projects in the academic institutions and faculty expertise
22/01/24, 8:32 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you, please.
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Oku
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Oky
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/01/24, 8:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/01/24, 8:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
22/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 531 7234: It's affordable
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tanyaradzwa, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
22/01/24, 8:40 pm - +263 77 531 7234: It's a nice offer
22/01/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
22/01/24, 8:41 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes please
22/01/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. <This message was edited>
22/01/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

22/01/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs

22/01/24, 8:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

22/01/24, 8:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
22/01/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 531 7234: I appreciate it as it gives hands on experience and exposure to the type of work you will do after completing studies making one well equipped for the industry
22/01/24, 8:47 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes it'll be beneficial to me
22/01/24, 8:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/01/24, 8:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes it is
22/01/24, 8:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/01/24, 8:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
22/01/24, 9:05 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Employability through practical training, earning while learning, provision of quality education and higher education concierge
22/01/24, 9:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Tanyaradzwa, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
22/01/24, 9:09 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes they are
22/01/24, 9:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Tanyaradzwa, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 9:10 pm - +263 77 531 7234: Yes sir
22/01/24, 9:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/01/24, 9:12 pm - +263 77 531 7234: I will be using my mother's phone my battery is flat
22/01/24, 9:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, and I hope your mother is also following the session.
22/01/24, 9:14 pm - +263 77 234 2811: $1500-$22500
22/01/24, 9:15 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Yes sir
22/01/24, 9:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am Ms. Garima, please.
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 77 234 2811: My apologies ma'am
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
22/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Okay
22/01/24, 9:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question.
22/01/24, 9:18 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Yes I think so
22/01/24, 9:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/01/24, 9:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/01/24, 9:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/01/24, 9:21 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Okay
22/01/24, 9:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
22/01/24, 9:26 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Sorry ma'am. May we continue tomorrow I have some assignments to complete tonight
22/01/24, 9:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
22/01/24, 9:28 pm - +263 77 234 2811: I'll be in class from 00:08 to 13:00 , can we please continue at 13:00
22/01/24, 9:29 pm - +263 77 234 2811: Sorry I meant 08:00
23/01/24, 9:55 am - Garima Edoofa: In case of your unavailability, it is mandatory for parents to continue the session. Due to a restricted number of slots for interviews and my limited time, it is crucial to promptly conclude your interview, considering the high number of applicants and limited available seats.
