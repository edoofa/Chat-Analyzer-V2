15/01/24, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.

EDOOFA is deeply honored to support the government in its endeavor to transform the education sector to achieve Sustainable Development which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education between now and 2030.

After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia.

Also, Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like Penmal Connect Ltd., and Trident College from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to

I encourage you to delve into these options, as they not only complement your compassionate aspirations but also offer diverse and meaningful avenues to contribute to the healthcare sector. May I know which field intrigues you more, please?
16/01/24, 1:32 pm - +260 760061219: Medical Laboratory Technology
16/01/24, 1:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course?
16/01/24, 1:34 pm - +260 760061219: Yes please

16/01/24, 2:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Magdaline.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?

16/01/24, 3:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 3:36 pm - +260 760061219: If I am given this opportunity to pursue my education at a higher standard, I would improve the education system in my country by encouraging citizens to study hard as it would encourage them to reach at higher level of education. Not only that, I would also like to give them such opportunities like mine in a sense that they would Perdue their dreams.
16/01/24, 3:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Magdaline, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - +260 760061219: Of course I agree
16/01/24, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 760061219: Yes
16/01/24, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

16/01/24, 4:10 pm - +260 760061219: India seems to be a place known for its excellent studies and opportunities given to international students
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Magdaline, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 760061219: From my perspective point of view, India is well known for its provision of medicals and If I were to study in India, I might become a professional with my career which is a really good thing.

By learning a specific skill or specialization in your fields of interest and by focusing on gaining expertise in your area of interest.
16/01/24, 4:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Magdaline. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 4:34 pm - +260 760061219: Not really.
16/01/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/01/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
16/01/24, 4:40 pm - +260 760061219: It is affordable for my family.
16/01/24, 4:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Magdaline what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
16/01/24, 4:42 pm - +260 760061219: Yes please
16/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

16/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
16/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:47 pm - +260 760061219: I think the Earn While You Learn is a very good program and I think it might benefit me as a student.
16/01/24, 6:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 6:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 6:28 pm - +260 760061219: The program can really help if at all my guardians cannot manage. But also being put on the scholarship program reduces the amount paid yearly.
16/01/24, 6:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/01/24, 6:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/01/24, 6:45 pm - +260 760061219: Affordable through guarantee scholarship and Earn while you learn program
16/01/24, 7:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Magdaline, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/01/24, 7:18 pm - +260 760061219: Yes they will be supporting me through out my journey
16/01/24, 7:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Magdaline, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/01/24, 7:30 pm - +260 760061219: Yes please
16/01/24, 7:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/01/24, 7:37 pm - +260 760061219: They would end up spending K45,265 that is if converted to my currency
16/01/24, 8:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/01/24, 8:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 8:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/01/24, 8:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
16/01/24, 8:04 pm - +260 760061219: Yes
16/01/24, 8:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/01/24, 8:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/01/24, 8:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/01/24, 8:16 pm - +260 760061219: So after taking the A-level test then I will a chance of admission?
16/01/24, 9:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to correct that by A-level result I mean grade 12th result, please.
16/01/24, 9:07 pm - +260 760061219: Sorry I misunderstood it
16/01/24, 9:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Magdaline, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
16/01/24, 9:29 pm - +260 760061219: Edoofa helps a student on scholarship to pay a less amount which is $2000-$3000 compared to the ordinary amount which is $6000-8000. A student under the Edoofa scholarship pays an admission which is $350 for enrollment, if the student’s parents or guardians cannot afford to pay the amount given above, the student will be put on the Earn While You Learn program which will enable the student to get credit on the tasks he or she is given and increase the chances of the student being given a higher percentage of scholarship.
17/01/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @260760061219 @260966994935
17/01/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
17/01/24, 9:58 am - +260 760061219: So when am I expected to pay the enrollment fee?
17/01/24, 10:01 am - +260 760061219: And am I given specific percentage of the scholarship?
17/01/24, 10:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Tentative dates will be shared with you shortly, and for that, you need to pass the interview round that will be with our program director Dr. Abhinav.
17/01/24, 10:42 am - Garima Edoofa: The higher quantum of the scholarship depends on the academics and along with that I would like to know in which year you will be writing you  grade 12th exams?
17/01/24, 10:44 am - +260 760061219: Okay.
So when is the interview?
17/01/24, 10:45 am - +260 760061219: I wrote my grade 12 exams last year, I’m waiting for the results.
17/01/24, 10:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Duly noted.
17/01/24, 10:46 am - +260 760061219: Yes
17/01/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Not to worry, Magdaline, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
17/01/24, 10:48 am - +260 760061219: Thank you, I’ll highly appreciate it.
17/01/24, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes Magdaline and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
17/01/24, 10:59 am - +260 760061219: Yes I have.
17/01/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
17/01/24, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
17/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/01/24, 11:04 am - +260 760061219: Yes I have understood everything.
17/01/24, 11:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
17/01/24, 11:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/01/24, 11:10 am - +260 760061219: Thank you.
17/01/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?

17/01/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/01/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

17/01/24, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/01/24, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

19/01/24, 8:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, As I was facing some urgent health challenges.

I am here to continue with our discussion, shall we start?
19/01/24, 9:15 am - +260 760061219: Yes please
19/01/24, 9:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
19/01/24, 9:29 am - +260 760061219: We tried reaching her but unfortunately she is not able to respond to any of our messages
19/01/24, 9:30 am - Garima Edoofa: In that case, you can even call Mrs. Ruth.
19/01/24, 9:30 am - Garima Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
19/01/24, 9:33 am - +260 760061219: Unfortunately she in unable to answer any of my calls
19/01/24, 9:57 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so in that case, @260760061219 
I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
