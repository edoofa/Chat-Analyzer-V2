23/01/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263715785475 @263713131410 @263773633594 , Hope you are doing well.
23/01/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
23/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 71 578 5475: Yes
23/01/24, 9:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
23/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 578 5475: Yes I understood
23/01/24, 9:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Tanya, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
23/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 71 578 5475: First, studying in India can have a positive impact on my career because it gives me the opportunity to experience a different culture, meet new people, and learn new ways of thinking. It can also expose me to different job opportunities  that l might not have considered before.
23/01/24, 11:25 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tanya. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 578 5475: I think it's very expensive
23/01/24, 11:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the same, please so that you can have a better clarity.
23/01/24, 11:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 11:47 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *BSc Forensic Science* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
