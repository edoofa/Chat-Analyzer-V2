If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
11/01/24, 5:37 am - +263 78 628 1583: Yes sir, l understood everything
11/01/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263772865880 @263786281583 , Hope you are doing well.
11/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
11/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Masimba, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
11/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 628 1583: Yes let us start
11/01/24, 12:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Could you please answer this please?
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Studying in lndia will implement a positive impact on my career because there are high qualified Educators, the degree programs of India are globally accepted and also there are research tools which are adequate for their learners and modern
11/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 78 628 1583: I also aim to achieve my career aspirations from studying in lndia because the education of India is globally accepted and also there is the use of Morden technologies and research tools which will make me be a well equipped and well educated figure
11/01/24, 12:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Masimba. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
11/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 628 1583: No, we do not know the expenses of higher education for an international student without a scholarship
11/01/24, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc. *after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
11/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 628 1583: The arrangements are quite good and lenient towards the students and their families which is helpful to them
11/01/24, 1:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: So shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes please, sir
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes, it will be handsomely benefitting me
11/01/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes please
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the pictures and the videos shared above, please.
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes it is something which l had been looking for
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, please.
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes sir, l went through them all
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
11/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 628 1583: I appreciate all the points but overally  support the third one
11/01/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Masimba, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes sir
11/01/24, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Masimba, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 628 1583: OK sir, l agree
11/01/24, 4:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Masimba as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 78 628 1583: $1500-$2250
11/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 4:49 pm - +263 78 628 1583: I also think so
11/01/24, 4:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 4:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Masimba basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/01/24, 4:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 78 628 1583: OK sir
11/01/24, 4:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Masimba, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
11/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 78 628 1583: OK sir
11/01/24, 5:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
11/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 628 1583: OK thank you sir
11/01/24, 5:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Masimba and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
11/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes sir, l have understood
11/01/24, 5:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 5:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/01/24, 5:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/01/24, 5:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes sir
11/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
11/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 5:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/01/24, 5:21 pm - +263 78 628 1583: In terms of registration will it be possible to pay when my results are out
11/01/24, 5:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
11/01/24, 5:24 pm - +263 78 628 1583: Yes
11/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 78 628 1583: And now in terms of employment are we given limited choices of work while we are at school
11/01/24, 5:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
11/01/24, 5:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
11/01/24, 5:47 pm - +263 78 628 1583: I wanted to ask also that does  accommodation  paid monthly
11/01/24, 5:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to refer to this message, please.
11/01/24, 5:49 pm - +263 78 628 1583: OK and my questions are over now, sir
11/01/24, 5:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
11/01/24, 5:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

11/01/24, 5:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well Masimba
11/01/24, 5:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/01/24, 5:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
11/01/24, 5:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
