13/01/24, 8:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783785988 @263772389609 , hope you are doing well.
13/01/24, 8:43 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
13/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 378 5988: Yes
13/01/24, 8:46 am - +263 78 378 5988: I'm fine
13/01/24, 8:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Great, So now I would like you to share the picture with me of your previous qualification results i.e O and A-Level results
along with the subject combination in A-level, and along with that may I know what desired course you want to pursue?
13/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 378 5988: I have not yet collected my ZIMSEC O Level certificate.
13/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 378 5988: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:34 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know is there any specific reason for that?
13/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 378 5988: I would like to pursue Audit and risk management
13/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 378 5988: There is no specific reason but I've been busy with other things and haven't had time to collect it yet.
13/01/24, 12:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Certainly, let me clarify. While "Audit" is not a standalone course, it is a critical aspect that falls within the broader field of accounting. Auditing is a specialized function within accounting that involves the examination and verification of financial records, statements, and transactions to ensure accuracy, compliance with regulations, and adherence to accounting standards.

In the context of education, courses in auditing are often included within accounting programs. Students studying accounting typically take courses that cover various aspects of the discipline, and auditing is a key component. These auditing courses teach students the principles, methodologies, and practices involved in systematically reviewing and validating financial information.

In summary, while there might not be a standalone course titled "Audit," auditing is an essential part of accounting education, and it is usually covered as a distinct topic within accounting programs that is *Bachelor of commerce*. This reflects the recognition of the importance of auditing in maintaining transparency, accountability, and the integrity of financial reporting within organizations.
13/01/24, 12:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, please.
13/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Okay then so should l choose another
13/01/24, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: So going through the results which you've shared, I would recommend a course for you by analysis of your hobbies passion and career inclination, and my expertise so the course is
 *Bachelor of commerce*
So may I know does this course aligns with you and May I know if you've managed to do any research about this course, please?
13/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Audit and risk management is a process that helps organizations to identify, assess, and manage risks that could affect their operations. The goal of audit and risk management is to ensure that organizations are aware of the risks they face and have plans in place to mitigate those risks. There are many different methods and approaches that can be used for audit and risk management, and the specific approach will vary depending on the organization and the specific risks they face. 

So, one of the key components of audit and risk management is identifying potential risks. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as risk assessments, interviews, and surveys. Once risks have been identified, they need to be analyzed and prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This helps organizations to focus their resources on the most critical risks. 



 After risks have been identified and prioritized, the next step is to develop strategies to mitigate those risks. This can involve implementing controls, procedures, and policies to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. It's also important to regularly monitor and review the effectiveness of these risk mitigation strategies.


This is the research l did
13/01/24, 1:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course, so that you have better clarity about the same?
13/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Yes

Additionally  this will  enable me to achieve my dream because as of now I cannot afford it
13/01/24, 2:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, ronell.

13/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Same to you 
Thank you
15/01/24, 9:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783785988 @263772389609 , hope you are doing well.
15/01/24, 9:43 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
15/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 378 5988: I'm alright
15/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Yes
15/01/24, 2:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 378 5988: If I were given the opportunity to study abroad through a scholarship, I would want to make sure  that I used the knowledge and experience I gained to give back to my country and help to improve the education system there

15/01/24, 2:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Ronell, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Yes l do agree
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Exactly l do wonder

15/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Studying in India would have a positive impact on my career in several ways. Firstly , I would gain exposure to a different educational system, which would broaden my perspective and give me new ideas and approaches to consider.  Secondly studying in India would help me to develop my language skills  which would make me a more attractive candidate for future jobs and opportunities.
Additionally ,Studying in India I have understood that there is enough requirements to enrich my studies and it is well equipped with everything needed
15/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 378 5988: I aim to achieve my career by making use and taking advantage  of the facilities in India,I guess I will not lack anything that I will need to persue my dream. 
I would set specific goals for myself and create a plan for achieving them. I would seek out opportunities to gain practical experience and develop new skills, and make an effort to connect with others in my field.
15/01/24, 4:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Ronell. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Thank you very much ,I have no idea of the expenses of International students in India,But I guess it will be expensive like these ones in my country
15/01/24, 4:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you have a better understanding of the same.
15/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

15/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
15/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 378 5988: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Noo it isn't
15/01/24, 5:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Ronell, what we do is, reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 5:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
15/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 78 378 5988: If I were accepted into the program, I would definitely be interested in pursuing the scholarship
16/01/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783785988 @263772389609 , Hope you are doing well.
16/01/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, I really appreciate that.
16/01/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
16/01/24, 9:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

16/01/24, 9:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this video as it will give you more insights of the program from the students itself.
17/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 378 5988: Okay
17/01/24, 9:13 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263783785988 @263772389609 , Hope you are doing well.
17/01/24, 9:13 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
17/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 78 378 5988: I'm alright
17/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 78 378 5988: Yes
17/01/24, 10:17 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/01/24, 10:17 am - Garima Edoofa: Ronell basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/01/24, 10:17 am - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/01/24, 1:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
17/01/24, 8:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

23/01/24, 4:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
23/01/24, 5:29 pm - +263 78 378 5988: Hello
