22/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263712082570 , Hope you are doing well.
22/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 208 2570: i m doing great how are you
22/01/24, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am doing good, please.
22/01/24, 3:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: So Bianage, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Marc!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what did you happen to learn from your friend?
22/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 71 208 2570: I didn't get more information from him .but what l want is a scholarship.a 100% scholarship
22/01/24, 4:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what exactly you mean by 100% scholarship?
22/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 71 208 2570: To be offered everything like tuition fees.food and accommodation and some favours
22/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 208 2570: Some scholarships pays for your air tickets again so that is what l m looking for
22/01/24, 4:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 71 208 2570: Okay Ok
22/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 71 208 2570: So did Endoofa offers any scholarship for international students
