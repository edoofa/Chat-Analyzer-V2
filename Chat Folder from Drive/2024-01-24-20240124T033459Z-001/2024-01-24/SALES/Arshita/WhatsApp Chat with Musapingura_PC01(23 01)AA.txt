You can address me as Ms. Arshita and we do have Mr. Jyotishman with us who is the Head of Admissions and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

23/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 637 0098: You
23/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 637 0098: Thank you
23/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 637 0098: Yes please
23/01/24, 1:06 pm - Arshita: Greetings!
23/01/24, 1:06 pm - Arshita: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
