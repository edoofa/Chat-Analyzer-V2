*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Blessed Ndlela.

I hope I have contacted the right person?
23/01/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could connect, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
