It provides financial support for students to help pay for a college degree. And the  funds enable students to obtain education they may not have access to otherwise. It also  reward deserving students with the ability to afford higher education. 

Yes l was referred to you by my friend Flora, she told me that Edoofa is a perfect scholarship program to  help me study abroad to proceed with  my studies till l finish my  Tertiary Education , she also told me that the program sponsor half of the expenses for my college education

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship.
