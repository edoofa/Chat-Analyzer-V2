*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

I am here to evaluate Chimbirimbiri Lenon's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
20/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 221 4255: Good morning to you too.
20/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 221 4255: We may start
20/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 221 4255: Pleasure to be addressed by you all from your prestigious organisation. I hope all goes well
20/01/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Wonderful!
20/01/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Lenon, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 221 4255: Okay
20/01/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Yes please
20/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 221 4255: I am the last born child in a family of five, with a brother(30) and a sister(25). I will be turning 19 this year. Both my parents are teachers with Diplomas in Education.


As a student I feel I have performed considerably well so far, as I got the equivalent of a distinction in my Primary level exams. I also had 6 As and 5 Bs in my Ordinary level exams. In A level I got 3 Bs in Maths Physics and Geography. I would say that my main weakness is in practical work due to a lack of practice. Also, I think one of my stronger traits is that I'm always willing to work hard in my academic work
20/01/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Lenon, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

So may I know more about your elder siblings, their qualifications along their current professions?
20/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 221 4255: My brother, Lyton Chimbirimbiri studied for a degree in Marketing at the University of Zimbabwe. He is now taking his education further in the United States of America now as part of a student exchange programme. He motivates me a lot as he has set the bar high for the rest of us.

My sister, Lindsay has a degree in Local Governance. She is currently working in the city of Gweru here in Zimbabwe. She and I are very close
20/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful Lenon!

It's a pleasure to know about them and their great interests in education.

I can see your parents are leading a family that greatly values education!
20/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 221 4255: Yes. Education is taken very seriously in my family and everyone is encouraged to pursue the career they are passionate about. I myself am interested in studying in the field of engineering, preferably Electrical but not limited to it
20/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Lenon.
20/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Alright so, can you share your O and A Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Electrical Engineering?
20/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 221 4255: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 221 4255: Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of my O level results as I have yet to collect my O level certificate
20/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: That's alright, Lenon!
20/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Congratulations on your A level results, Lenon!
20/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 221 4255: Thank you
20/01/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Electrical engineering, Lenon?
20/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 221 4255: My main motivation to study Electrical Engineering is a natural interest in the field, curiosity is what some might call it. I have long been fascinated by the work of greats such as Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, Faraday and the likes. They brought about the life of civilization as we know it. I want to spearhead further advances in the production, transmission and use of electricity in the morden world. I believe that there is still much to be said and done about Electricity in this morden day and age as the means with which it is being produced in countries like mine are barely sustainable
20/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Amazing knowledge, Lenon, I can this is definitely well thought off and well researched.

It's great to know that you wish to build a promising future in the field and realise the needs of it too!

On this note, let me first brief you about your desired course so that you have an even better knowledge, isn't it?
20/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 221 4255: Thank you.That would be nice
20/01/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Electrical Engineering has very good career opportunities in professional career such as all power generation, transmission; distribution companies can offer them a very good remuneration as per their skills. Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
20/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 221 4255: Noted. This sounds like a programme well worth the while and the work
20/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
20/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Alright Lenon, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 221 4255: I can see myself perfectly being enabled to achieve my dreams by this program. In five years I can see myself having completed my studies and now working for a distribution company, hopefully one that's focusing on bringing electricity to the remote areas. I would be doing more of research on more cost effective and sustainable ways to bring power to everyone.
20/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: That is really great Lenon, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 221 4255: To be honest, I do believe that studying abroad would be better for my career goals as it would increase my chances of employment for bigger corporations such that I can have more influence on the field. I also don't believe that I would get the right amount of exposure to aid me with my practical skill problem here in Zimbabwe. Moreover, I think seeing how other countries are doing things would go a long way in making me more innovative, as innovation is one of the more important assets in Engineering
20/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: You see, Lenon, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
20/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 221 4255: I'm glad you see it that way too. We have seen some tough times for graduates of esteemed institutes here
20/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Yes please, I do understand.
20/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: However, I am glad that you are making efforts for a promising future too, Lenon.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
20/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 221 4255: Well... I do know a lot about the Indian education system, but I think what stands out is the setting that it is ini, India having one of the greater populations in terms of cultural diversity. Despite this diversity, English is still a primary language so I won't have to waste time on a language course like in some other countries. India also has an affordavle education system as I have learnt from my research. I also hope to become a part of its thriving global alumni network
20/01/24, 11:02 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Lenon!
20/01/24, 11:02 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

20/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, Mr John

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 221 4255: It is evident from the number of Indian-originated CEOs that India can open a gateway of opportunities as expected
20/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 399 7978: Ok , thank you.
20/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: So far I have discussed regarding Lenon's course and about India please!

If you happen to have any queries kindly feel free to share!
20/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
20/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 221 4255: I believe the average cost ranges from $2000 to $5000 in tuition for undergraduate courses, based on the quality and field of education
20/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
20/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 399 7978: I'm glad you are considering him.. I hope you will be able to help him in his endeavor.
20/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same!
20/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
20/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 221 4255: That is considerably lower and would go a long way in assisting my education financially
20/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
20/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
20/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 221 4255: I think the earn while you learn programme is a great idea
20/01/24, 11:28 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
20/01/24, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Lenon, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 221 4255: I definitely would agree that while tuition and institutional levies are lower, the cost of general tetiary education in Zimbabwe is much higher in total due to the expenses incurred from other basic necessities
20/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Lenon!

I believe now you are in an even better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Lenon?
20/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 221 4255: Yes. I can see that
20/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
20/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

20/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 221 4255: Noted. Are the EWYL programs mandatory?
20/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: It's a choice please.

The students who wish to learn skills as well as earn credits can participate!
20/01/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: You are alloted an EWYL mentor as well who guides you throughout your journey in India!
20/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 221 4255: Thank you for clarifying
20/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
20/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 221 4255: Ok. It sounds like a very lucrative initiative
20/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Lenon!
20/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 221 4255: Yes. I do appreciate it
20/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So Lenon, are you aware that the child of Deputy Head of your school is also a part of the Edoofa program?
20/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 221 4255: I was unaware
20/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Isn't it exciting to know the same now?
20/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 221 4255: It is. It brings about more interest
20/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
20/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 221 4255: I'm ready
20/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Lenon, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
20/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 221 4255: $1500-$2750
20/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Lenon, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Definitely... It's a lot of assistance
20/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Noted
20/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Yes
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

20/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

20/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Okay
20/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries, Lenon?
20/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 221 4255: So far, no. If I have any I will get back to you
20/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
20/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

22/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: How was your discussion with your parents, Lenon?

What all did you discuss?
22/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 221 4255: We discussed the cost of studying in India at great lengths. However, overally we are satisfied with the program

22/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
22/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 221 4255: Yes. Mrs Ruth's story is one that has provided great motivation
22/01/24, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words!
22/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
