11/09/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Mr Gibson, now as we proceed with our discussion,

I would firstly like to know you and Mrs Marble better as parents to Melissa.

Please go ahead and share about yourself including your profession and highest education qualification.
11/09/23, 11:11 am - +27 73 996 6033: I am a truck driver working  in Rsa .married to Marble  .Mellisa is our second born .first is Lincon doing medicine at University of Lusaka .
11/09/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Well received Mr Gibson, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself.

I believe Melissa is an U6 student at First class academy please?
11/09/23, 11:20 am - +27 73 996 6033: Yes  she promise to do well
11/09/23, 11:22 am - Harmehak: That's great!

Mr Gibson, I would proudly like to mention that we have students who would coming to India from First class academy this year as well as next year from Melissa's batch itself please.
11/09/23, 11:22 am - Harmehak: You must have read that Edoofa is associated with First Class academy in the shared description. <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 11:23 am - +27 73 996 6033: So does your sponsorship  covers all educational needs or only party
11/09/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Mr Gibson, actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
11/09/23, 11:33 am - +27 73 996 6033: Ok understood
11/09/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Could you please share more about Melissa please?

11/09/23, 11:39 am - +27 73 996 6033: She is a focused girl .serious on her studies . Very quite  and respectful . She likes reading  .
11/09/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: That's great,

11/09/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Mr Gibson, I can see in her student file, she is studying Mathematics, Computer science, Statistics and business studies at A level!

Could you please confirm the same?
11/09/23, 12:36 pm - +27 73 996 6033: Yes
11/09/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Gibson, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
11/09/23, 1:05 pm - +27 73 996 6033: Ok
11/09/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gibson, may I ask if you are aware of what exactly Melissa wishes to pursue for her higher education please?
11/09/23, 1:10 pm - +27 73 996 6033: IT
11/09/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

Mr Gibson, as per her subject combination and her desired interests, she is eligible to study,

 *Bachelor of science in computer science*

*Bachelor of computer application*

Hereby, I shall be briefing you about both, so that once Melissa is online she can finalise her course please.

15/09/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Mr Gibson.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 73 996 6033: Yes
15/09/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: That's great!
15/09/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 73 996 6033: Herbert.vcf (file attached)
15/09/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/09/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

15/09/23, 12:34 pm - +27 61 072 1944: Very fantastic, si what's the proper procedure do you consider, and qualifications fir students
15/09/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: So far I have discussed her course and about India with Mr Gibson!
15/09/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
15/09/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: However we always motivate students to aim for better as that provides great impact on their application.
15/09/23, 12:42 pm - +27 61 072 1944: Noted thanks
15/09/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/09/23, 12:51 pm - +27 61 072 1944: Quiet interesting
15/09/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, please!

Now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist both parents and Melissa. <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/09/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/09/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

@27739966033 @27610721944
15/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Sorry sir  I will be at school when the session is contacted
15/09/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I understand Melissa!

Are you available now to complete the session?
15/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Yes
15/09/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/09/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Following
15/09/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 019 2848: How are these scholarship credit awarded
15/09/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 019 2848: So does the Earn as you learn program give you adequate time to focus on your studies
15/09/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, you see you would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would plan your schedule accordingly so that you can work in your free time.
15/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Okay
15/09/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: The another great part about the Earn While You Learn Program is that you start from Zimbabwe itself, which helps you earn credits even before coming to India!

Isn't that great?
15/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Interesting!!

 so how are these programs conducted when you are still in Zimbabwe
15/09/23, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Online please!
15/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Okay
15/09/23, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Melissa, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Yes am ready
15/09/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Melissa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/09/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 019 2848: If the student will end up paying between $1500 and $2250
15/09/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/09/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/09/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 019 2848: The student will end up paying $1500  and $2250
15/09/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 019 2848: So if part of the enrollment is paid by the Edoofa program does that mean the $350   Is supposed to be paid by the student
15/09/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Melissa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/09/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, however only after you are accepted into the program and have received and acceptance letter.
15/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Okay
15/09/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/09/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 019 2848: That is true
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/09/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 019 2848: I understand
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/09/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/09/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 019 2848: I will surely do that
15/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Thank you
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 11 am CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
15/09/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
16/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 019 2848: How are you
16/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Sorry was at school
16/09/23, 5:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How was your session with Ms.Harmehak?

How are you doing today ?
20/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 019 2848: Good morning
20/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 019 2848: Sorry I will be at school
20/09/23, 10:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Kindly ask your parents to continue the session in your absence .
20/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 019 2848: How are you sir
21/09/23, 11:12 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
I am fine thank you 
How are you doing todayy?
21/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 019 2848: Am fine thank you
21/09/23, 12:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your parents manage to connect with Mrs.Ruth ?
21/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Yes sir
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to ask all your questions ?
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Yes sir
21/09/23, 3:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any questions for me ?
21/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Sir doe the Edoofa sponsor you until you are done with your education or it will only provide you with the earn as you learn
21/09/23, 4:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please reframe your question
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Oky
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Does the Program sponsor you until you are done with your education
21/09/23, 4:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Certainly, Edoofa is a scholarship program rather than a sponsorship. If you are inquiring whether the scholarship remains in effect throughout the duration of your course, then the answer is yes. If you are found eligible for the program, you will receive the scholarship to support your education throughout the entire course.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

19/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Melissa!

So are you excited to perform well in your interview and test too so that you can aim for a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 019 2848: yes i am
19/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
19/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
19/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 019 2848: Thank you
19/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
19/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 019 2848: I really appreciate
19/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you or your parents have any queries?
19/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 019 2848: As for me i dont have any queries
19/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
19/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gibson, as parents are you willing to support Melissa's higher education in India both mentally and financially?

If so, do acknowledge the same using a voice note please.
19/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 228 9172: Yes I will give full support
19/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Kindly acknowledge using a voice note.
19/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 228 9172: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate your acknowledgement!
19/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
19/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
19/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
19/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
19/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th January 2024 for $200 and the 26th or 27th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
19/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 77 228 9172: First one
