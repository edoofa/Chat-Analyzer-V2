18/01/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

However are you aware that both your interests are covered under one Degree itself?

That is *Bachelor of Commerce.*

Do you wish to know more?
18/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ohhh ok really,,,then I would like to know more for sure
18/01/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.

18/01/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians!
18/01/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ohhh ok ok l see that's nice ok I understand why India has been chosen by edoofa now
18/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok for now thank you
19/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 099 2422: Ok I am well today,,,we can continue with our discussion
19/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
19/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 099 2422: Ummm I don't think they are familiar of these coz that is why I was waiting for you to give me a brief as you said yesterday
19/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
19/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok ok I see now I understand
19/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok the cost is reasonable somehow right
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok I see I get it now thanks for the brief
19/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
19/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Patron, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
19/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok ok I guess this earn while you learn will definitely help too
19/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Thank you that's a nice thing to hear
19/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
19/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Patron, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
19/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes exactly what u are saying is actually happening here ohh and I think for sure the costs will.be reduced if I pursue Indian education
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

Are you now in an even better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Patron?
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes now it has become clearer to me how you are doing it
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 099 2422: But can l ask how I know that I'm eligible for this program
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

19/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Which program please?
19/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok ok good I will check  the links you gave me to learn more about the experience of AGR
19/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Accounting
19/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Or let me say bachelor of commerce
19/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: You are eligible as your results are already out, Patron!
19/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ohhh ok ok it sounds even more good now
19/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Thank you I'm happy to hear that
19/01/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Patron!
19/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Have you followed the discussion so far thoroughly?
19/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes I understand
19/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes I have tried my best
19/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok I am ready let's go
19/01/24, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: Patron, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/01/24, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ohhh ok ok so that's the cost of applying in most universities right,,,,so it is not refundable
19/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Around 1500 right
19/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes, This is the case for students who apply for international education by themselves without Edoofa.
19/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 8:22 pm - +263 78 099 2422: So I would like to pay 750 to be part of edoofa program but will this guarantee that I will definitely be included
19/01/24, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: The fee is $350.
19/01/24, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/01/24, 8:23 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ohh ok I see but after paying the 350 what's next
19/01/24, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: I will brief you. <This message was edited>
19/01/24, 8:23 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes of course I do
19/01/24, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 8:24 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes of course share it
19/01/24, 8:26 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok ok I understand that's reasonable then you have to help me the next step
19/01/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/01/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/01/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/01/24, 8:29 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Yes I have gone through it and I have seen the process so I hope step 1 is about to be finished
19/01/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/01/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/01/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
19/01/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 8:32 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok ok l see Ms
19/01/24, 8:33 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Thank for the information
19/01/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/01/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
19/01/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 8:34 pm - +263 78 099 2422: Ok thank you at least maybe I will understand better for sure
19/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
19/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “20-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
20/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
20/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 174 8415: Good day Ms Harmehak so far we have discussed with my brother I think you should proceed with his application now
20/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!

Haven't you discussed everything with your parents?
20/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 174 8415: We've discussed as a family together with our parents and they agreed
20/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So far, does anyone have any queries for me?
20/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 174 8415: So far we have no queries
20/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
20/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 174 8415: Thank you...have a blessed day...if you have anything else or any information yo might need just send us a message
20/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Sure Ms Moreblessing!

Meanwhile, Patron would be participating for the remaining discussion.

21/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 099 2422: I am waiting for her response

22/01/24, 8:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning,

22/01/24, 8:31 am - +263 78 099 2422: Ok thank you Ms Harmehak
22/01/24, 8:31 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
22/01/24, 8:31 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:32 am - +263 78 099 2422: Ohh ok let me find strong network somewhere so that I can download it
22/01/24, 8:33 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
22/01/24, 8:33 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Patron, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/01/24, 8:43 am - +263 78 099 2422: 1 Bachelor of commerce 

2 India

3  $8000

4  I don't know yet

22/01/24, 8:45 am - Harmehak: Can you elaborate answer 4 and 6, Patron?
22/01/24, 8:46 am - +263 78 099 2422: 4 $1200-$1800


6 7 days
22/01/24, 8:46 am - Harmehak: Correct!

So are your parents willing to support you for the same?
23/01/24, 9:24 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I was expecting to hear from you yesterday, 

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
23/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same are you aware of the following students?
