As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 71 304 5927: Good morning to you too and yes we shall proceed
18/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 71 304 5927: Can*
18/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
18/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 304 5927: A scholarship that carters for my school fees and living arrangements
18/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 304 5927: Noted so there I had described a sponsorship instead of a scholarship
18/01/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
18/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 304 5927: Wow that's a strong powerful reputation that you have
18/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 304 5927: Impressive
18/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
18/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
18/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 304 5927: That's exactly what it is
18/01/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Khahliso, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Inyathi high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

18/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 304 5927: My name is Khahliso L Makhurane I went to Inyathi High school. That's where I started my form one up to upper six I didn't transfer to any other high school. I was more of quiet student I knew people but I didn't play with everyone. I was an athlete short distance runner and I played soccer as well a little bit of basketball and a little bit of tennis and I also played chess. I like reading novels the bigger it's the better. Inyathi High school was a boarding school and the school fees was $250 and sometimes they would ask for a top up on the school fees. My main strength is that am a calm person I don't panic when I get into a problem and I always like seeing the good side each and every predicament I meet. I aspire to be a cyber security specialist and now am focused on getting my cyber security bachelors degree. My Father is a war veteran and his highest level of education is O level. My Mother is a Teacher and her highest level of education is a university degree. My oldest sister is currently working at MCAZ (Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe) and she's married same goes for my second sister she works at DELTA and she's an accountant.

18/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same itself?
18/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 71 304 5927: Yes I would

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

18/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Am more than impressed
18/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Khahliso 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yes I had, researched it beforehand and notified my parents about it
18/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
18/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Am surprised by how expensive the other countries are
18/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 71 304 5927: May please elaborate a bit on the EWYL Program my friend didn't tell me much about it
18/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Khahliso!
18/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I will discuss the same in detail with you!
18/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Khahliso, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
18/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 304 5927: This sounds really good and highly intriguing at the same time
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 304 5927: I really wish I was there to attend these webinars and I would really like to get some hands on experience first hand
18/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: You participate in this webinars online and you would start with your Earn While You Learn Program from Zimbabwe itself.
18/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 304 5927: There's an EWLY program at this side and here I thought it only starts at that side
18/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: As the program is done online itself you begin way before coming to India!
18/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Now am way more interested in reducing their monthly cost to zero if possible
18/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Thats the spirit, Khaliso!
18/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yes now I can clearly see it there are no other scholarship organizations like this one
18/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yes I am
18/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Khahliso, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 304 5927: $2100 around there
18/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Wow this is good news early bird catches the worm
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yes it's
18/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 304 5927: That's a good way to go about the economic instabilities at this side
18/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Am following
18/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Khahliso;
18/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Since my A level results are out will we have to move on to step or phase three
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yes I have
18/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Noted then how can we check if am eligible
18/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: In stage 2 you will participate in a test and an interview.
18/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Ok noted
18/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Ok am following
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

18/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, do request your parents to connect as well.
18/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Okay I will tell them to also contact Mrs. Ruth Magwaza so that they can also hear it all first hand and luckily my friend is an edoofian and is also my neighbor at this side
18/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful, Khahliso!
18/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yea it's right that's how I came to know about Edoofa in the first place
18/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: I believe you are referring to Hove?
18/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Yea although I didn't know her other name was Hove
18/01/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: I understand
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Ok so now are we done with stage one or is there still more of it left
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

18/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Thank you and same to you
18/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Thank you Khahliso
19/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 304 5927: Good morning
19/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 71 304 5927: I just wanted to know if the upcoming process will be done here on WhatsApp or through video conferencing
19/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Today's discussion will be in this group itself.
19/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 71 304 5927: Ok thanks
19/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Khahliso and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
19/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 304 5927: Yes we discussed everything luckily my parents don't have any questions at the moment
19/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 304 5927: Yes we may proceed
19/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I am glad you have such supportive parents!
19/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: So in that case, may I know if you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
19/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 304 5927: Yes they told me that they already started talking to Mrs.Ruth
19/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
19/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
19/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 304 5927: Everyone was hands on here and am impressed and more even more interested to join the edoofian community
19/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: I am glad!

I believe you are excited to join this year's event in Zimbabwe, Khahliso?
19/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 304 5927: Yes I am
19/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: That's great
19/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Okay so Khahliso, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

(First paragraph)
It is to a lesser extent that many Africans have poor diets because of the farms being stagnant and inefficient. A large population in the African continent highly rely on agriculture and farming as their source of food. Many people do not necessarily want to do farming it's due to the low employment rate that pushes people to do agriculture or small scale farming and also due to that it does not require any special qualifications. 

(Second paragraph)
It is to a lesser extent that many Africans have poor diets because of the farms being stagnant and inefficient. Political instability that is also a result of corruption is one of the major reasons behind why many Africans are unable to afford a healthy lifestyle. Corruption negatively affects the African continent through that the money that is supposed to be spent on developing the country ends up being spent on other irrelevant things.

(Third Paragraph)
It is to a lesser extent that many Africans have poor diets because of the farms being stagnant and inefficient. Many African countries are under heavy fire from the enemy that goes by the name inflation. The low economy that most African countries have allows inflation to ravage them without remorse. Due to this many Africans then go and do agriculture or small scale farming as their way of trying to combat inflation and attain a better form of lifestyle.

My name is Khahliso L Makhurane am a young man that's mainly goal oriented. I am slow to anger as I always presume there's always a safer way out of each and every situation. I don't like panicking as I know that it has its own detrimental effects I like to first calm down and then I continue with what I will be doing at the time. I like sports and my favorite sports are soccer, tennis, basketball and also being an athlete. My favorite board game is chess and I like to think that am a good chess player. When it comes to the music I listen to old school RnB and Gospel music. I do not like unnecessary attention on me and I like to read novels and self development books. My favorite novel franchise that I read is _Harry Potter_ and my favorite book on self development is currently _48 laws of power_ .

19/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 304 5927: Let me contact them to reach out to you right now
19/01/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
19/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Good afternoon am Khahliso's father
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Hello Mr Makhurane!

How are you doing today?
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 349 5164: I had already taken the liberty of going through the documents you had already sent and that's where we got the answers to the questions we where hoping to ask you
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 349 5164: I am good and you
19/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I understand please and I am glad you have thorough knowledge as we speak!
19/01/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any query for me?
19/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 349 5164: At this point in time may you just expagorate a bit on the young man's first year tuition fee in relation to his registration fee
19/01/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Are you referring to the Stage 6 please?
19/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Yes that's the one am talking about
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: You see for students while applying for international education they always have to pay a separate registration fee.

However for our Proud Edoofians, there is no separate registration fee.

The fee that is paid as registration fee will be deducted from Khahliso's first year tuition fee itself.
19/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 349 5164: That's good news to hear and I also wanted to know if you are going to be covering his transport costs to India and his living arrangements at that side
19/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: While the Food and Accommodation costs are included in the cost after the scholarship,

Let me provide you a better clarity regarding living arrangements.
19/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
19/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Those where the only queries that where currently present in my mind thank you
19/01/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 349 5164: So when can the young man start earning the scholarship credits
19/01/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: If all goes well before the end of this month he will join the Earn While You Learn Program!
19/01/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Mr Makhurane, are you aware that Khahliso's friend Hove is currently in India?
19/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Hopefully all will go accordingly
19/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

We do look forward to the same!
19/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Yes he told me about and then I talked to my neighbour about it as well
19/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Oh thats wonderful!

It must have encouraged you too, isn't it, Mr Makhurane?
19/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 349 5164: Yes it did thats why we are fully supporting the young man through the whole process
19/01/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
19/01/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th January 2024 for $200 and the 26th or 27th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
19/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 349 5164: The young man had already told us about this part and I would like to go for the first option
19/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 349 5164: And yes we are prepared for it
19/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you all had a thorough discussion already and you are dedicated for his studies.
