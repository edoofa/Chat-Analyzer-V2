23/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
23/01/24, 11:18 am - +27 66 438 4119: Yes I think I'm good
23/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: That's great!

How was your discussion with your parents?
23/01/24, 11:25 am - +27 66 438 4119: Well it's was great
23/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: I am glad,

What all did you discuss with them?
23/01/24, 11:29 am - +27 66 438 4119: We discussed about what will happen if I get the scholarship. Like how it would make everything better for me and that it would be a good thing being away for some time for me
23/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that you had a thorough discussion!

So far, do they or you have any queries for me?
23/01/24, 11:30 am - +27 66 438 4119: I think I'm good now I'm just a little nervous
23/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I can understand please!
23/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
23/01/24, 11:33 am - +27 66 438 4119: Yes. she helped a lot. She was very inspiring.
23/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
23/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
23/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 11:40 am - +27 66 438 4119: I've watched the video.
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: That's good,

How was your experience, Leeroy?
23/01/24, 11:43 am - +27 66 438 4119: It was inspiring and it gives me lots of hopes
23/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: So are you motivated to join this year's event in Zimbabwe, Leeroy?
23/01/24, 11:43 am - +27 66 438 4119: Yes that would be great
23/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I am glad!
23/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Leeroy, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/01/24, 11:51 am - +27 66 438 4119: 1. Bachelor of engineering in electrical engineering
2.in India
3.from $6000 to $9000
4. $2000 to $3000 less with The work while learn program
5. $350
6.in 7 days
7. Yes
23/01/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Very correct!

I am glad you thoroughly followed our entire discussion, Leeroy!

So given the finances, are your parents willing to support you with the same?
23/01/24, 11:53 am - +27 66 438 4119: Yes they are
23/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Could you please request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note?
23/01/24, 11:55 am - +27 66 438 4119: Oky
23/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Yes please
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - +27 71 069 5260: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and appreciate your acknowledgement, Mrs Amabel!
23/01/24, 12:05 pm - +27 71 069 5260: Thank you
23/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Amabel, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
23/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - +27 71 069 5260: Thank you
23/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
23/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same in a voice note.
23/01/24, 12:28 pm - +27 71 069 5260: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 30th or 31st January 2024 for $200 and the 27th or 28st of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 30th or 31st January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/01/24, 12:34 pm - +27 71 069 5260: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!

Now for the further stage, there would be an interactive with the Program Director with you and Leeroy!

While the video call for you would be of 5-10 minutes itself, Leeroy would have a technical round for him using voice notes.
23/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: You can respond to the same Leeroy.
23/01/24, 12:40 pm - +27 66 438 4119: Yes  ma'am
23/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Let me proceed with the same in that case.
23/01/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Amabel can join as soon as she is available.
23/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 66 438 4119: Oky
23/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
