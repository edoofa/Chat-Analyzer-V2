We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

Thank you
19/01/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 779696856: Yes sir
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 2:01 pm - +260 779696856: Yes sir
19/01/24, 2:01 pm - +260 779696856: I am
19/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so @260779696856, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 2:47 pm - +260 779696856: Yes sir I do
19/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now @260779696856 , I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

23/01/24, 3:04 pm - +260 779696856: After studying  cardiovascular  technology  for three years  , i see myself  after five years practicing  cardiovascular  technology  from the knowledge  and skills  I acquired  from the edoofa  program.  As a cardiovascular  technologist I would be fortunate  to work alongside  other cardiovascular  technologists and cardiac surgeons. 
    I see  myself though hands on clinical experience and exposure  to technology  and life services  through the program.i see myself gaining  deeper  understanding  of the cardiovascular  system  and the role I would play in diagnosing and treating  various  cardiac  conditions. 
       Looking  ahead in the five years after obtaining  the degree  in cardiovascular technology , I envision as a highly  skilled  and respected  cardiovascular technologist.  I see myself  going  for further  studies  to obtain  a masters in cardiovascular technology, to enhance my knowledge  concerning  the different aspects  of cardiovascular  technology,  which will help me to provide  accurate  and reliable  diagnostic to help with different  patients  that I would encounter. 
  I see myself  becoming knowledgeable  enough  to analyze  and interpret complex  cardiovascular  data ,which would enhance  the diagnostic  process.
23/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great @260779696856 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
