*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
11/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 283 9309: Thank Mr Gurvinder Singh for contacting us about the possibility of a scholarship for our son,
11/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Chiponda,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
11/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 283 9309: Thank you Mr Gurvinder !!
11/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Chiponda, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Jeston, is that correct?
11/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 283 9309: That's correct sir, Jeston is friend of my son
11/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Jeston, also do tell me whether you learnt about Jeston’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
11/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 77 283 9309: I heard that Edoofa Program assists those students who would have done exceptionally well in their Advanced Level Results like what Jeston did.
Jeston had the opportunity to study in India at subsidized tuition fees and benefited from the high technology of Indian education system unlike our situation in Zimbabwe
Also Jeston will be offered more opportunities to secure a job or further his studies 
Its quite an uplifting and life changing  journey

11/01/24, 9:40 pm - +263 77 283 9309: Noted, thank you !!
12/01/24, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 386 1078: We will be there!
I'm looking forward to an elegant event.
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 283 9309: You are welcome sir !!
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 283 9309: Thank you for the detailed explanation of the program
Now our wish is that you also consider Matipashe Prince in this program
We would be very excited to be on board !
12/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 283 9309: Exactly,  you are on point !!
12/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chiponda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Definitely !
12/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 283 9309: Oh yeah we are willing and able !!
12/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Now Matipashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

I will never disappoint.
13/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Matipashe, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry
13/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 386 1078: Okay , Noted.
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with any of the given courses?

15/01/24, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

15/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 386 1078: With the passion i have to make a difference in the medical sector by saving lives , venturing in Bachelor Of Science in Medical Lab Technology would give me a chance to come up and  invent cures and vaccines for diseases and other enigmatic conditions.
In 5 years time i would have started my own Medical Research centres focusing on testing samples eg athelets who are to participate in International Events and Finding solutions to troublesome conditions eg cancer.
Edoofa Program will help me  cut my finincial costs and it has already helped me  career-wise by providing information about the program i'm interested in. I would really appreciate that.
With the assistance from Edoofa i will be able to complete the program i'm interested till i have my own wings.
15/01/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Matipashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 386 1078: Yes Mr Gurvinder!!
15/01/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 386 1078: The chief reason why i want to study abroad is because of the modern technologies available there. India to be specific , is rated worldwide in the medical sector and it has standard universities which are recognized internationally. Learning in such an environment can help me reach my full potential and maximise the talents and passions i have for the field. I'm also interested in the Edoofa Program because of the Earn while you Learn Program' this will help me become more independent faster.
To sum up , these are my reasons for studying abroad.
15/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 386 1078: As an person who is very observant , i'm planning to note down the key aspects which can help our own country , which i would have learnt from the education system abroad. 
After gaining so much value and influence in my medical field , i can also impart the valuable information i would have learnt to the authorities responsible for our education system for example the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education.
15/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Matipashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 386 1078: I definitely agree Mr Gurvinder !!
15/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Yes , that's true.
15/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

15/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 386 1078: I'm really fascinated by this! 
This is impressive.
15/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now Matipashe, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 386 1078: After studying in India , Am i given a job opportunity there or i will have to find it elsewhere?
15/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Matipashe in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
15/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Okay that's benefincial.
I'm answered , thanks.
15/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Not really , You can inform us.
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Noted. 
I appreciate the Edoofa Program.
15/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Okay
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Matipashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Thank you , I have understood it.
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

15/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 386 1078: This is brilliant and helpful.
Yes , i think this will benefit me as well.
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Matipashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Okay , Noted.
15/01/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Exactly , I'm looking forward to this !
15/01/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Matipashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Yes that's accurate.
15/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i have.
15/01/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i am.
15/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Matipashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Between $1500 - $2250
15/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Matipashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Okay Noted.
15/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 386 1078: I'm on board
15/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Matipashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Noted.
15/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 386 1078: No i'm not.
15/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Matipashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
15/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 386 1078: Yes
15/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
15/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 386 1078: No
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 283 9309: Good morning Mr Gurvinder and Endoofa team

We have always given Matiapashe freedom to do a program of his choice, of course with some level of guidance from us as parents.

His dream program has been Medicine (Doctor) at the University of Zimbabwe.

But with  coming in of Endoofa in our picture, he had to make a very quick decision on which degree program to embark on hence the aspect of having to change the degree program mid way

We hope you will understand and bear with us as he is trying to choose a career for all his life 

Sorry for our indecision- like approach and any inconvenience this may course

But what we are very clear about for Matipashe and the whole family is that Endoofa is the best way forward for us 

Thank you !!
16/01/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I understand Mr Chiponda, It is not an issue unless and until I am not informed about the same, timely communication is well appreciated by me.

16/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 283 9309: You can give us more information sir

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

While the scars of the genocide still linger , Rwanda has engaged on a path of healing and transformation. Already , significant change in economic development , social relations and governance is being noticed. Approximately eight hundred thousand lives were lost including leaders , teachers and skilled proffesionals which had an impact on economic development.Due to the trauma , communities were torn apart , and trust among ethnic groups were severely wounded. During the genocide , infrastructure such as schools , hospitals , roads and houses were destroyed. The latter hindered the delivery of essential services. Despite the prior situation , Rwanda has been able to make remarkable progress to improve the economy in all sectors . Its progress after the genocide can be attributed to a combination of regional integration , strong leadership , strategic socio-economic development and international cooperation. Economically , Rwanda has experienced significant growth and develepment. The country has a vision aiming to strengthen key sectors such as tourism , services and agriculture , and improve infrastructure. As a result , it has become an attractive destination for foreign investment. Rwanda has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards , although challenges remain , mostly in rural areas. An acceptable level of stability and security has been reached , this has allowed its citizens to live in a safe environment. Efforts to promote unity and reconciliation have been undertaken at both the national and community levels. While challenges remain , progress has been made rebuilding trust. Socially , it has made efforts to empower women and promote gender equality. Women now hold significant roles in politics , business and civil society , which is very brilliant ! Additionally , efforts have been made to promote education and healthcare for all. The cost of living in Rwanda is relatively low compared to other African countries , and the local currency , the Rwandan franc is stable. In terms of health , Rwanda was one of the two countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that achieved all the health Millennium Development Goals (M.D.Gs) , although malaria , HIV and AIDS , and malnutrition are major health issues in Rwanda due to lack of doctors and nurses. Life expectancy at birth is 55,7 years and it is regarded as one of the safest countries to visit in Africa. Life for visitors and tourist is generally positive as Rwanda  is known for its safety and security. Overally , the country offers a unique reward experience for tourist , combining wildlife encounters , cultural experiences and the opportunity to witness the country's inspiring post-genocide transformation.

In conclusion , the genocide is denoted by resilience and impressive progress. Rwanda's transformation serves as an example of how a nation can rebuild and heal after a devastating tragedy.

*MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY*
Life is a journey filled with ups and downs , and each of us has a special story to tell. In this essay , highlighting the challenges i faced , the lessons i learned and the determination that propelled me forward.

I was born in Zimbabwe into a humble family , surrounded by love but limited resources. Education became my cornerstone of my hope and dreams. I recognized that knowledge had the power to transform lives and break the cycle of poverty. Despite finincial constraints , i pursued education with unwavering determination. I pursued my studies relentlessly , often sacrificing sleep and social activities. I encountered failures and setback that tested my resolve. Yet deep down i knew that success was not measured by the absence of obstacles but by the ability to rise above them. I seat for my O'level in 2021 an i passed with 6As and 4Bs. I slowly began to see the fruits of my labor as opportunities opened up. I then engaged into Advanved level 2022 aiming to study a medical program afterwards , and as usual , i was down to work. At school i was highly disciplined , i exhibited excellent time management skills and i effectively balanced my academic commitments with extracurricular activities like sports. My integrity and ethical conduct made me a role model among my own peers. Being a devoted Christian holding values in my right hand gained me respect within my surroundings. Due to the latter facts presented , i was selected the schools Headboy during my final year in highschool. Recently , the A'level results were released and i had distinctions(As) in all my subjects , Pure Mathematics , Biology and Chemisty. As for now i applied for the Edoofa Program Scholarship and i hope they are going to find me suitable and select me. I'm looking forward to a bright future and i will continue being a hardworker in all areas of my life. In my pursuit of success , i am humbled by the challenges i overcame and the growth i experienced. I hope that through sharing my inspirational journey , i can inspire other to embrace their own unique path.

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
