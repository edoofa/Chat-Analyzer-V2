I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Thrive*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>

11/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 039 0856: Hie
11/01/24, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Shalom. How are you?
11/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Am fine and you
11/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing rgeat please
11/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Thrive?*
11/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 039 0856: 1-It has always been my dream to study abroad especially in India because it gives the opportunity to pursue my passion as the scholarship encourages students to explore their interests
It also motivated me to apply for the scholarship program because it provides financial assistance to students who are interested in pursuing tetiary education
The edoofa scholarship program's goal to increase access to higher education motivated me especially for students from underrepresented groups
The sense of community and support that comes with being part of the scholarship program also motivated me to apply for the program
India is a diverse and culturally rich country and there is the experience of variety of cultures and traditions and this also motivated me to apply for the scholarship program




2-Thrive made the discussion easy to understand therefore l understood that the scholarship program provides assistance in financial situation for example the fee hikes of universities in Zimbabwe has made some students to delay pursuing their dreams by looking for money to go to university unlike the scholarship program in India that gives an opportunity to study and pursue thier dreams
I also understood that there is room for opportunities of being employed after graduating in India
Thrive also made it clear that studying in India is affordable
The earn while you learn is helpful by giving the students a chance to even support the family during the course 
Studying in India makes students to receive a world class education at a fraction of the cost of studying in other countries
11/01/24, 4:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
17/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

17/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.
*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

Reducing corruption in my country and getting back to the real traces of law will be my motto.If l get a chance to be part of the edoofa family ,l will help other students that are unable to pursue their tertiary education due to the same or worse situation like mine.I  would also spread how good the edoofa scholarship program is as l have been doing this past time.Being in the edoofa family makes me to help other students to know what they really want to do in their future so as to achieve their goals.When l become successful in life ,l will get the opportunity to supply gadgets in less privileged schools in my country like donating laptops, tablets etc so that everyone gets an opportunity to access the internet since during this era internet is the Mastermind .

22/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
22/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 039 0856: Am okay
22/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: That is really great @263780390856 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Yes am ready to take some extra hard time to succeed
22/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Okay it has always been my dream to study abroad experiencing many things and by the way due to fee hikes in my country we are unable to make it to tertiary education , electricity problems
22/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Basically, my country is backward when it comes to it's development. It's still a developing country. Firstly l want to start with creating a community that rises against early child marriages. Our culture is however backward for some religions still believe in these child marriages and are marrying girls off at a young age. Another thing is teaching children about law. As a lawyer l know l will be an inspiration to most so l will use what l learnt to help uprise the future leaders of my country
22/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community @263780390856 , but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 039 0856: I agree
22/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Yes it is
22/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

23/01/24, 8:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 78 039 0856: Same
23/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 039 0856: How are you
23/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 039 0856: Good morning
23/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 039 0856: No we are not aware but as l once heard that it's affordable
23/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 78 039 0856: So how l do l get a 100 %fully funded schoolarship
23/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Please that will depend on the counselling session, the scholarship test, and the interview.
23/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 039 0856: Ohh okay l get it
23/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Yes please
23/01/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: @263780390856, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/01/24, 10:01 pm - +263 78 039 0856: I understand
23/01/24, 10:47 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
23/01/24, 10:49 pm - +263 78 039 0856: Okay noted
