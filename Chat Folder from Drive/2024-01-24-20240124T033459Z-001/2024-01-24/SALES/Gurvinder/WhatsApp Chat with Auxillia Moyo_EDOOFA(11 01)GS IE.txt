15/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Auxillia, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

22/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 78 007 6871: Yes
22/01/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

22/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
22/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 007 6871: Yes I am confident in achieving it

22/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 007 6871: I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with a passion for electrical engineering. I have big ambitions for my future, and I hope to start my own company in the field. My company will focus on both creating new technologies and providing services to other companies. I believe that this approach will allow me to make a significant impact in the field and achieve my goals. With hard work and dedication.
Edoofa's program can enable me to achieve my dreams by providing financial support, which can allow me to focus on my studies and research without worrying about money. It can also provide access to resources and networks that can help me grow and develop as a professional. it can also gives me a sense of validation and accomplishment, which can motivate me to continue working hard and pursuing my goals.
22/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Auxillia I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.
