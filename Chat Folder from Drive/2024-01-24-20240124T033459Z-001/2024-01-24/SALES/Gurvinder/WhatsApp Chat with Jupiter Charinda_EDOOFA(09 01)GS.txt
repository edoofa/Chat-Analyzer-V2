09/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Afternoon sir. Sir please can I know the qualifications which are required for one to have scholarship?.
10/01/24, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Good afternoon everyone. 
  I hope now you are fine Sir Gurvinder.
10/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Trish, also do tell me whether you learnt about Trish’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
10/01/24, 4:40 pm - +263 77 282 8719: I learnt that Edoofa Program is one of the the programs that also helps students in Zimbabwe to continue with their education in university. Again it is based in India only. I wasn't told about Trish's journey and experience with the Edoofa Program.
10/01/24, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/01/24, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Since l come from a less previledge family my mother is mainly the one who is advising me to apply for the scholarship because my parents have divorced...
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you for shedding more light about this program to me.
10/01/24, 9:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
10/01/24, 9:53 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you.
God bless you too
11/01/24, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

11/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Jupiter, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you sir so, l should give you my parent's phone number?.

13/01/24, 8:33 am - +263 77 282 8719: Good morning everyone!
13/01/24, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
13/01/24, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you for the advice. Yes sir lm confident about achieving it so l will work hard in order to score higher points.
13/01/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
13/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 282 8719: Yes sir you can.
13/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law.

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

13/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you sir. Sir, u mean while lm still studying Bachelor of Arts,l will be also doing some practical learning like doing some attachment or it will only be a theory learning only?
13/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Please, it would be a mixture of both.
13/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 282 8719: Oky thank you sir now I understand. Thank you sir
13/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you.
I wish that after 5 years of the completion of this course, l will be one of the best lawyers mainly in my country.Again l will not have any record of a losing case since the program will improve my skills at work. Moreover l will be able to assist my family with financial assistance hence l must be a hard working student in order to achieve all my dreams. If I get into Edoofa's Program,it will definitely help me to achieve my dreams because my family members alone cannot send me to university to study law so if I get into Edoofa Program it will be my first achievement because going to university is one of my dreams.In addition, l understand that during my learning l will be doing both practical and academical learning due to that l will be able to achieve my dream of being one of the best lawyer.
To conclude l say Edoofa's program will be the best in helping me to achieve my dreams. Thank you.
13/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Jupiter I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 282 8719: Morning  everyone.
15/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 665 0025: Good morning how are you doing today
15/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
15/01/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 282 8719: The mainly reason why l want to study abroad is that, while studying abroad there are many opportunities of being employed or to start the career with a big rank and same time since it is my wish to attend a university so me having scholarship abroad is another reason l would go abroad for my studies.
15/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Actually I will have many programs which will help me  with financial assistance inorder to help the less privileged in my country mainly on education and some of the basic needs. Again l will cater to some scholarships which will be based here in Zimbabwe. And l will also help parents to realize the rights of children mainly focus on education. Also search for assistance for different types of organization which will help me to improve assess of internet mainly in rural areas.
Thank you.
15/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Jupiter, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes I agree with you sir.
15/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes l would like to know why.
15/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

15/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you.
Now l understand why lndia is known for higher education destination and it also inspires me to do hard working
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: So now Jupiter, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 282 8719: As for now you have lightened everything for me. I only want to know how many points are required for one to get the scholarship.
15/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this, but scholarship will also be decided upon the test and the interview.
15/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you sir for the answer.
15/01/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Not yet ahead
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you for the information sir.
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes sir you can.
15/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Jupiter, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Thank you sir. l understand  the concept EWYL.
15/01/24, 9:44 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
16/01/24, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 282 8719: Morning everyone.
16/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 77 282 8719: Oky sir
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

16/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes this will definitely benefit me a lot because I will be learning more skills with the EWYL.
16/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Jupiter, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Oky l understand that sir thank you once again
16/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yeah know l understand, and this is the type of education l was looking for.
16/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Jupiter, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes are the ones who will be supporting me
16/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Are we not supporting you by reducing the cost to $2000-3000, and then we give you a chance to reduce it more by the EWYL program, so for the rest, will not your parents support you?
16/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 282 8719: They will support me.
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Oky sir. Let me add them
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - ~ ::@k added +263 77 464 4598
16/01/24, 7:46 pm - +263 77 464 4598: I thank you all the Admins for creating this group.lam Mr Josiah Charinda the father of Jupiter Charinda Who resides at Chimanimani, Manicaland province.
16/01/24, 10:54 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
17/01/24, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 282 8719: Good morning everyone.
17/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Yes lam ready sir.
17/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Iam very very appreciating your hand to my son.Surely your fee assistance is great.l thank you so much.
17/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Charinda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Ok sir l understand you very well.After he made an application is it means to say you will be considering him to be university student
17/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Charinda, can you please answer in figures, I am trying to explain something to you here.
17/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Ok go ahead
17/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: So if applying to one university costs around $350-450, what will it cost for 5 Universities?
17/01/24, 9:09 pm - +263 77 282 8719: It will be $ 1500
17/01/24, 9:30 pm - +263 77 464 4598: When do you expect to get this money
17/01/24, 9:33 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Where are you coming from.When did these scholarship commence
17/01/24, 9:35 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Is this a reality or fake
17/01/24, 9:48 pm - +263 77 464 4598: Is not easy to reap what you did not sow
17/01/24, 9:54 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
18/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

18/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 282 8719: Good morning
18/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mr Charinda, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes sir
18/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/01/24, 11:14 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Sorry we have network issues today.
18/01/24, 11:14 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Yes it is.

*“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
19/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 282 8719: Oky sir
19/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Jupiter basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/01/24, 9:23 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
20/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 282 8719: Morning sir. Due to heavy rain in my country there is no electricity and network. Im sorry because I may not attend some of my session due to that.

23/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Jupiter, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 10:17 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
