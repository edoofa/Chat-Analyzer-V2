10/01/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 10:54 am - +260 95 5345199: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a unique program that aims at giving opportunities to students in Africa and sub Asian countries, on meritorious grounds. The uniqueness is in having an opportunity for students in higher education with earning opportunities .
10/01/24, 10:56 am - +260 95 5345199: Kindly bear with me in responding late as we are having challenges with internet service. its flactuating.
10/01/24, 11:05 am - +260 763861372: Good morning sir
10/01/24, 11:09 am - +260 763861372: According to my understanding and information given to me from peers, it's a scholarship program based in India that helps give students an opportunity to acquire a higher level of education (University) with financial aid.
10/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 11:39 am - +260 763861372: Yes I am
10/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Berachah, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 11:56 am - +260 763861372: Yes I do.
10/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now Berachah, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

11/01/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: @260763861372 So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Software Engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
11/01/24, 10:28 am - +260 763861685: For my senior and junior year in high school, Food and Nutrition was one of the elective subjects I took and from there is where I got my interest from.Due to the increasing interest, in my junior year, I got a certificate under TEVETA, which is a world class technical education vocational and enterprenuership training system contributing to economic development in Zambia. 
In senior year (2023), I participated in the HEAZ competition. A program that allows pupils to demonstrate their different skills in the field of food and nutrition. I participated in a quiz and scooped second position. 
And finally in 2023, I was awarded best performance in Food and Nutrition.
With all these achievements, I'd like to do something in the health sector to help improve people's diets/eating habits and look for better alternatives.
11/01/24, 10:47 am - +260 763861372: My reason for wanting to study software engineering is because of the activities I partook in high school and also because of my vast knowledge and interest in computers. In my last year, I participated in two activities that got me interested in my choice of study.
The first one is Junior Engineers, Technicians and Scientist (JETS) competition where I scooped third position in a quiz. The second one is a social coding program (SHERO) which is a non profit making company that is looking to empower youths by giving them digital skills that they can leverage for new skills.
When the social coding program was introduced, we were tasked with activities like making websites, we built Lego based robots, learnt to code, and did many different things. All in all I scored first position.
In a nut shell, because of the experience I gained from both activities, I gained a lot of interest and skills in IT and I'd like to put them (skills) to good use.

B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

11/01/24, 4:08 pm - +260 763861372: It makes it a good foundation for achievement  and seems like something you would want to be a part of
11/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 763861372: From this vast exposure of information in this interview,  kindly consider us for this opportunity to skill, re-skill and up-skill through Edoofa Scholarship.
11/01/24, 9:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

12/01/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 9:09 am - +260 763861372: Good morning sir, let's get started
12/01/24, 9:09 am - +260 763861685: Good morning to you too sir.
12/01/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: So now you both, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
12/01/24, 9:44 am - +260 763861372: Not quite yet, as for now, all is understood.
12/01/24, 9:46 am - +260 763861685: All is understood thank you
12/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
12/01/24, 9:49 am - +260 763861372: No, but please do enlighten us
12/01/24, 9:49 am - +260 763861685: No we are not quite certain on that.
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 10:49 am - +260 763861372: They are quite expensive, but I would like to appreciate the earn while you learn program, such a great strategy.
12/01/24, 10:49 am - +260 763861685: They are quite expensive and I think the earn while you learn program is very helpful.
12/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
12/01/24, 11:41 am - +260 763861372: Yes please, elaborate
12/01/24, 11:41 am - +260 763861685: Yes please.
12/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/01/24, 11:46 am - +260 763861685: This is a very good program that I would love to be part of.
12/01/24, 11:47 am - +260 763861372: As said before, the EWYL program is an excellent strategy and like something you would like to be a part of
12/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

12/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
12/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 763861372: My take on the content provided to us is that this EWYL program isn't good just for helping with earning scholarship credit, but also helps one gain and harness skills that will certainly be of use in future in relation to getting jobs. So yes, I do think this will benefit me.
12/01/24, 12:01 pm - +260 763861685: Much certain it can. It is very beneficial in that it provides one with a picture of life after they graduate and also opens up various opportunities due to the vast amount of skills learned and developed by an individual.
12/01/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 12:10 pm - +260 763861685: As stated earlier, the EWYL program is very helpful to all individuals that are part of it and I would like to experience and be part of it as well.
12/01/24, 12:11 pm - +260 763861372: I'm glad to know that there's no limit as to how one can earn scholarship credit. And, I'd like to make known that I do indeed think the program is a pleasant aid .
12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/01/24, 12:28 pm - +260 763861372: Absolutely! To know you can do something worth praise and making others proud is something I would like to do. And knowing that through hard work and dedication you can do a lot more than you know is worth it. I'd like to also like to commend Edoofa for being exceptionally different.
12/01/24, 12:28 pm - +260 763861685: It is definitely something I have been looking for regarding international education. It is amazing how just by one's consistency, you are able to earn enough credits and still benefit by gaining and developing skills and most especially, immerge financially independent.
12/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Berachah and Bernice, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
12/01/24, 12:56 pm - +260 763861372: Yes where possible, they will
12/01/24, 12:57 pm - +260 763861685: Yes, where possible, they will support
12/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
12/01/24, 12:59 pm - +260 763861685: Yes we have
12/01/24, 12:59 pm - +260 763861372: Yes, I have quite a few times. But not really in depth
12/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 1:00 pm - +260 763861685: Yes I am
12/01/24, 1:00 pm - +260 763861372: Go ahead
12/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: Berachah and Bernice as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - +260 763861685: Around, t
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 763861685: Sorry that was a mistake
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 763861372: Well, it's an expensive undertaking as seen. However,  we would not commit ourselves to apply to more than one university. The more reason  we seek help from Edoofa.
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please answer in figures.
12/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 763861372: Probably around $1,500-$2,250
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Berachah and Bernice, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 763861372: That's a really good privilege offering students good opportunities through affordability.
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 763861685: Wow, that is a good strategy and makes it even more affordable for students
12/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 1:29 pm - +260 763861685: It certainly is.
12/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/01/24, 1:36 pm - +260 763861372: It sure is convenient and gives a good advantage to students. The phases of enrollment are well understood and I'm willing to get to know more
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 763861685: This is a very convenient series of phases one may take when applying. And I understand more and willing to know more.
12/01/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
12/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 763861685: Certainly not.
12/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 763861372: No, please enlighten me
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Berachah and Bernice, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
12/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 1:46 pm - +260 763861372: Yes I have, go on
12/01/24, 1:46 pm - +260 763861685: Yes, very clearly.
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
12/01/24, 1:49 pm - +260 763861372: So, you get to pick a University of your choice?
12/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: You can choose from any University that sends you an acceptance letter.
12/01/24, 1:51 pm - +260 763861372: Alright thank you sir
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.

Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.
