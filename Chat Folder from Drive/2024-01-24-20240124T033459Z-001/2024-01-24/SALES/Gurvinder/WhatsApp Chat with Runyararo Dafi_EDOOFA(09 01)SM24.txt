*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Munyaradzi?*
09/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 717 1803: 1)  I got to know about Edoofa through one of my Teachers.  The teacher understands my situation, my financial situation and my capabilities at school.  So he urged me to apply and be an Edoofian.   I want to be an Engineer (Aeronautical or Mechanical) and wish to reach the best in that field.  From the Testimonies I was listening to by the Edoofians already in the system I believe Edoofa can also help me to achieve my dreams by giving me the chance to enrol in some of the best universities.
2) My basic understanding is that Edoofa can help you to achieve your life dreams.  If you have passion and drive to work hard, with Edoofa the sky is the limit.
09/01/24, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
09/01/24, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
09/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 717 1803: Yes we can begin.
09/01/24, 11:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/01/24, 11:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
09/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 717 1803: Thank you very much for the detailed information about Edoofa.  I really look forward to be part of the 5000 scholarship seats.
09/01/24, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/01/24, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I am very happy to note that we have Edoofians from my province, Manicaland.  St David's Bonda, Hartzell High School, Nyazura High, Chibuwe High Andrew my school St Faiths High are amongst the best in the province in terms of performance.  Such schools are Christian schools that have discipline that fosters good results.   That makes me confident that I can be part of Edoofa.
09/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 717 1803: , Chibuwe High *and* my school . . .  (correction)
09/01/24, 12:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Dafi
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
09/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 717 1803: As parents we are excited to have our son linked with Edoofa and pray that he will succeed in getting the scholarship.  I am his father with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Studies.  I used to manage well established companies, but unfortunately our economy took a downturn that led to the closure of many companies.  During our time at University the thrust was on strategic management and companies that needed muanagers of that calibre were many.  Now, with the Land reform process the economic structure changed.  Commercial farms that were the backbone of the agricultural sector were disabled.  Commercial Farmers left and the farms were subdivided into smaller portions and distributed to the locals.  This had an adverse effect on the industry performance.  The economy became informal.  I lost my job and got into the informally sector, in my case farming projects such as piggery, poultry etc.  I had hoped that we could access bank loans but this did not work out. The banking sector is struggling; we are a major risk to them.  Yes we are trudging in but unfortunately will not be able to make our son realise his dreams.  And this is where our joy came when we got to know about Edoofa.  We are confident of our son's performance; but we are handicapped financially.  My wife is a tailor but again this will not enable us to take our son to University.  What really motivates me to support our son to study abroad is the quality, focus and exposure that comes with studying abroad.  The world is now a global village and interaction at that level is extremely good for our son.  He will also increase his chances of employment outside Zimbabwe and ultimately help his family back home and his country as well.
09/01/24, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr and Mrs Dafi*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Runyararo*, right?
09/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Surely, you have summarised it.  Thank you very much.
09/01/24, 1:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Runyararo*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A-level/Grade-12?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
09/01/24, 4:37 pm - +263 77 717 1803: My name is Runyararo Dafi, aged 18 years.  I am the first born in a family of five (4 boys and 1 girl).  One of my brothers is waiting for his O Level results.  My twin brothers are in Grade 7, and my sister, Grade 2.  We have a plot where my parents do farming projects; my mother is a tailor.  My father has a Business Studies degree and my mother has an O Level certificate.  I did my O Level and A Level at St Faiths High school, Rusape, Manicaland.  I was a day scholar.

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
11/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning, surely we can start.
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
11/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 717 1803: Honestly, so far our expectations are being gradually addressed through the information that you our Counsellor is providing, the meetings/addresses/conferences that are being shown.  We are happy and determined to be part of Edoofa.  Maybe one concern here as Zimbabwe; our A Level results should come or be released end of this month, January.  Is this process going to be on until then for students like Runyararo who want to pursue degree programs that we think require a Level results or how do you handle that?  Or maybe the 1st Intake or batch of students is well after the end of January?
11/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 717 1803: And also great experiences through the Edoofians' Testimonials are giving us invaluable information.  We really enjoyed Valerie Rukobo's Rising To The Top - An Edoofian Journey of Accomplishment".
11/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 717 1803: Valerie's testimonial took us from the start of the Edoofian Journey, the internship options and how they help the student's financial plan to contribute towards Fees and pursue further studies - the benefits of the Earn While You Learn program; moving from "No Sponsor to Self Sponsorship".  Really great to hear.   She really acknowledges the role of the counsellors and the Edoofa team when you are far from home!
11/01/24, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Gladd to hear that Mr Dafi
11/01/24, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
11/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Runyararo is on his way from where he was sent by his mother.  Real apologies for the slight delay.  (Runyararo's Father)
11/01/24, 1:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
11/01/24, 8:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:21 am - +263 77 717 1803: We realise the importance of this session.  We did not want to rash Runyararo on his response.  By 10.00am you would have received his response and we can continue.
12/01/24, 7:12 am - +263 77 717 1803: Saint Faith's high is the school that I studied at previously.  It is located about 10km from Rusape town in the Manicaland province.  Saint Faith's developed to become one of the best schools in the country, a powerhouse of academic excellence.  Students from all walks of life appreciated the education system because of its uniqueness and desire to succeed.  Saint Faith's is a school that is not only recognised for its academic performance but also a school gifted with a great sporting culture and vibrant ethnic values (Ubuntu).  Saint Faith's helped me to become what I am today.  Even when I was a day scholar, I was exposed to great opportunities.  I became a talented volleyball player and became a member of the school team.  We managed to participate in the Zimbabwe NASH (National Association of School Heads) competition.  Moreover I even developed academically with the resources they provided.  My technical skills improved greatly.  I was an outstanding student in Technical Graphics at O Level.  I was also the best student in Mathematics in Form 2 in all the Anglican schools in the district.  I also became a strong  Christian believer , a problem solver, practical and acquired skills to adapt to situations in society.  I had activities that I participated in for my holistic growth.  Being a member of the volleyball team and participating in national sports events I developed to be cooperative and influential in teamwork.  I was also a nominee for the Mathematics Olympiad and represented my school, Saint Faith's.  We performed but unfortunately we only qualified for Round 2.  We were unable to participate in the last round.  One thing that I loved about Mathematics Olympiad is that during the process, I believe, I developed intellectually throughout understanding mathematical concepts.  I also improved my problem solving skills.
12/01/24, 10:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

12/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Very informative.  Really helps to build focus and confidence in Runyararo.  Thank you.
12/01/24, 2:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's amazing, can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
12/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Runyararo is working on it now; but will send it through by 10am tomorrow.  We really want him to concentrate on it and it might be late by the time he finishes.  Thank you for your guidance.
12/01/24, 2:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please, In the meantime shall we proceed ahead?
12/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Yes we can proceed.
12/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 717 1803: We are confident.  As indicated in earlier messages Runyararo sat for 5 A Level subjects:. Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Technical Graphics and Additional Maths.  We should make it!
12/01/24, 3:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
12/01/24, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
13/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning

13/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 717 1803: When I complete my Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering, I want to be deployed in India's best aerospace institutions or similar.  India is a growing hub for the aerospace industry.  This course, as it provides a concrete foundation, I see myself as a specialised engineer in the aviation industry.  I believe my passion  also lies in the design, testing, and maintenance of aircrafts.  My course will equip me with the skills to provide consultancy to world class companies such as Boeing, Airbus or similar.  As indicated in your brief about the course, the course gives candidates the freedom to become a pilot or an opportunity today roam in space - I see myself as part of these prestigious opportunities.  And critically I want to be part of the change in the aerospace world that seems to make the world a better place to live.
13/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 717 1803: We really are anxious to know why you have anchored on India.  But our interaction with you so far and our increased desire to understand India better as far as Higher Education is concerned we realise that your thrust on affordable, accessible higher education that leads to employment dovetails well with India as a country that is known for its affordable higher education.  India has earned a reputation for delivering high quality education at a fraction of the cost compared to many Western countries.  This affordability factor is particularly appealing to Africans students facing financial constraints.  Edoofa is passionate about affordable higher education and India provides the conducive environment for that.  Edoofa has gone a step further by introducing programs such EWYL to make higher education even more affordable.  According to QS Higher Education System Strength Ranking 2016, India is 25th among top 50 higher education providers.  Also, Edoofa, being naturals in India, they are able to understand and navigate the environment and identify or create conducive environments that best suit students from diverse backgrounds.
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

13/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 717 1803: From the great experiences shared by proud Edoofians in their testimonials to the enriching stories in the Education brochure; the Edoofa program has proven to be the true key to unleash great potential in a student.  Surely Edoofa will be the perfect scholarship to pursue and to achieve my dreams without failure.

During high school still learning at St Faiths, students would perform outstandingly but many of them found it very challenging to pursue higher education in their fields of interest.  Most of our African universities seem not to provide programs that cater for the exceptional students.  So sometimes students would be forced to change from pursuing a passionate course.  Thanks to Edoofa, getting into your scholarship will enable me to pursue my desired course.

Pursuing programs like Aerospace Engineering are expensive and challenging.  Universities that offer this course are limited and expensive.  I am thrilled that I got to know about Edoofa.  I am hoping that I will be offered the scholarship, study and perform to the satisfaction of my sponsors, Edoofa, and to the joy of my family.

Through learning at top Indian Universities Ibwillbget the opportunity to meet students from diverse cultural backgrounds and great lecturers.  I will be exposed to modern technology in aviation.

I also look forward to the Earn While You Learn program.  This in my view is one the best programs for us disadvantaged students, financially; for we can be part of it and raise money to self sponsor and also support my school going brothers and sister back home.  I will also be able to assist my parents with their projects.
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Very informative. Thank you.
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Very informative.  Thank you.
13/01/24, 1:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
13/01/24, 1:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
13/01/24, 1:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

13/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Noted.  Good Weekend.
15/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 717 1803: Our country is different from other countries in terms of education standards, both infrastructure and quality of the system.  Many countries abroad have moved on to understand the power of knowledge and have developed robust educational systems with world class institutions and cutting edge modern technologies, passionately. Therefore, if I am to study in such institutions I will have a better understanding of the theory and practice of my intended course, Aerospace Engineering.  Some of our Zimbabwean educational qualifications are not recognised internationally.  Our institutions are not resources well enough to produce an international student.  This can be a problem later after graduating.  Most job opportunities require internationally recognised qualifications.  Studying abroad will help me to acquire internationally recognised qualifications and increase my chances of getting employment all over the world.  I have always dreamt of one day working beyond a my continent and rubbing shoulders with international professionals in my field of study.  Studying abroad will enable me to have a better understanding of the different cultures and languages.  This interaction will develop me as a person and as a professional.  Studying abroad will also enable me to have a smooth career path that will guarantee me of a good salary.  The jobs can be complex but rewarding.  This will give me an opportunity to help my family back home; my siblings for a better education and family income generating projects.
15/01/24, 9:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

15/01/24, 10:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: *“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.”*
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
15/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Is this message for us?  (Mr Dafi for Runyararo Dafi)
15/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Today we sent through the responses on this at 09.51.  At 09.53 you sent us a message on whether we should start.  At 09.55 we acknowledged that yes we could start.  And that was the last time we got a message from you until 16.22.  We were waiting for some communication from you.  We are really disturbed.
16/01/24, 9:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 717 1803: We are well; had really got worried with yesterday's message.  Yes, we can start.
16/01/24, 9:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
16/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 717 1803: None at the moment.
16/01/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
16/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 717 1803: We have picked that some Universities charge USD$3000 Tuition per Semester excluding Accommodation, Flight, Visa.  We are not sure whether this is the average for those offering Aeronautical Engineering.  We pray that we get an Edoofa seat so that through the scholarship and  EWYL program we are able to manage the cost.
16/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal added Gurvinder
16/01/24, 4:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Day,

16/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Noted.

Have a Good Day!
16/01/24, 4:57 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Thank you very much.  We will be ready for our session at 10 am CAT tomorrow.
17/01/24, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 8:42 am - +263 77 717 1803: We are present and ready for our session.
17/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
17/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 717 1803: We have picked that some Universities charge USD$3000 Tuition per Semester excluding Accommodation, Flight, Visa.  We are not sure whether this is the average for those offering Aeronautical Engineering.  We pray that we get an Edoofa seat so that through the scholarship and  EWYL program we are able to manage the cost.
17/01/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 717 1803: Thank you for the update on higher education cost.
17/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 717 1803: If it is an Annual Fee, surely we can work hard to cover it and also through the EWYL program that Edoofa offers we should manage.
17/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 717 1803: And also since the Annual Cost includes balance Tuition, Food and Living expenses, we should manage.
17/01/24, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
17/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Yes, you may.  Apologies for the late response.  We had challenges with our phone.
17/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: @263777171803 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 717 1803: We are really grateful for the information on EWYL program.  It's really a program that makes us appreciate the assistance that we get from Edoofa.  We also want to contribute towards our higher education cost - there is no better way, in our view.
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

17/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
17/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 717 1803: The EWYL program enables me to interact with the industry.  That exposure prepares me for my entrance into the industry.  I will have a soft landing as it were.  It allows me to understand the current situation and how I can apply myself so as to contribute positively.  It is really important.  I will not be taken to the deep end when I join my specific industry.   The exposure through the interaction with industry practitioners benefits me by way of relating theory to industry realities, working with those already practising and sharing their experiences and learning from them.
17/01/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Runyararo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I have understood your explanation.  It still remains my greatest concern that I must work towards my higher education cost.  The more credits I get the better, as long as it does not affect my studies.
17/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Surely it is - Self sponsorship for my studies is the ultimate aim.   I am grateful and motivated by the testimonies and certificates.  I look forward to the Edoofa experience.
17/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Runyararo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
17/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Very true; but the reality is that higher education is beyond the reach of many of our parents.  The students' Loans and Grants that the government used to provide are no longer available.  I am looking forward to higher education assistance by way of a scholarship and similar EWYL programs.  The contribution from my parents will be very minimal.
17/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
17/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
17/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I have.  Apparently I am the first born.  We are working together.  In fact I wanted Aeronautical Engineering, Edoofa recommended Aerospace Engineering.  My parents have also encouraged me to take Edoofa's advice.
17/01/24, 10:11 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 6:21 am - +263 77 717 1803: We look forward to our session at 10am today and everyday until we satisfy your expectations and Edoofa's.
18/01/24, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
18/01/24, 9:01 am - +263 77 717 1803: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder Singh.  We can start.
18/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Yes, I am ready
18/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: @263777171803 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I will end up spending $1500 - $2500.
18/01/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263777171803 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I have noted the Program Fee - $350.
18/01/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Surely it becomes a one stop shop.  We are excited that Edoofa makes higher education in India, home away from home; we have  someone making our preparations real and what it will be if we get a scholarship seat.  We have a shoulder to lean on as we try to understand a new environment and also when we try to settle.
18/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: @263777171803 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Noted.
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 717 1803: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Just a reminder/update.  I have already completed my A Level and find  attached are my A Level results.
18/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
18/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
18/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I copied the steps in the cycle.  The step 4 that I copied says "On clearing the interview, a student receives The Letter of Acceptance".  I am familiar of the cycle because it is in the information Edoofa sends but I really look forward to the details.
18/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263777171803 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
18/01/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Its very clear now.  Thank you.
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
18/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I just need some clarification on the $350; and the Registration Fee  What is the difference?
18/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Please the enrollment fee is $350, the registration fees is a part of the first year fee and nothing else.
18/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Noted with thanks.
18/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
18/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/01/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Runyararo’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
23/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Like we indicated Mr Singh, Runyararo is our 1st born child and he performed very well.  We are grateful for that.  We cannot fail to walk with him on this Edoofa journey.

23/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *29th or 30th of January 2024* for $200 and the *29th or 30th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *29th or 30th of January 2024*
Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 717 1803: We will go for Option 2.  We will manage.  How do we make the payment?
