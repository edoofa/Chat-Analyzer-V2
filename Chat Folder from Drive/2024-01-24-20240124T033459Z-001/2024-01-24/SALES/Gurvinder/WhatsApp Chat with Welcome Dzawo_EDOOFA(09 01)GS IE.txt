11/01/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: Please I appreciate your research, and I would like to tell you that Bsc Data Science is counted under an Engineering course, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
11/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 660 7006: This means no exceptions made
11/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.

Apparently I need guidance from you on how I can get a program that has a high chance of successfull career
11/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the course I offered you before is a highly pursued course that gives opportunities to get jobs even before you complete your degree here in India.
11/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand that the regulations for the program I wish I would do are beyond your control sadly for me but I’m really desperate for that program out of passion.

15/01/24, 8:38 am - +263 78 660 7006: I talked to my parents and they told me to do a further research on my program and the eligibility in Universities in India before I make a decision, I looked for these programs and I saw that for eligibility of the B.Sc (Honors with research) Computerscience(Data Science) requires Mathematics and related subjects whereas B.Tech Computerscience and Engineering (Data Science) requires Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry for eligibility
15/01/24, 8:58 am - Gurvinder: Well, I can offer you a BSc in Computer Science, but specialization in Data science is something that if offered after the first year of the course by the University itself, and not by us, are you fine with that?
15/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 660 7006: Is it guaranteed?
15/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 660 7006: Or it’s by chance?
15/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Please, nothing is on the chance, the requirements will be set by the University itself and will be informed to you in the first year.
15/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 660 7006: What should i do to earn that? <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: As I told you before those will be simple enough requirements set by the University itself.
15/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 660 7006: I understand, we can proceed
15/01/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/01/24, 9:51 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

18/01/24, 11:43 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

23/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Hello, How are you? 
I hope you are doing well.
I had to take some time to myself to make a deep research on the career path I would want to pursue. I came to a realization that Data Science is a vast field with a lot of attributes to it besides some universities and colleges offering it as a Undergraduate degree whereas it is a department with its core fundementals and related skills to be a specialist in the field. My research tells me I need a strong foundation in Statistics and then along the journey you major into some related courses or programs that improve your career profile. I’m kindly requesting to get assistance into acquiring the best place for a degree in Statistics so that I further my career and ambitions from that baseline going forward. I hope to be working with you in future career advancement studies as I proceed to the masters and more qualifications. I hope you will respond soon.

My apologies for the hold and delay in making a solid decision. I’m very sorry for the confusion, I showed and I promise to work with you guys properly until the last process of this application.
23/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Good afternoon Welcome.
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Good afternoon
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 660 7006: How are you
23/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Welcome, I appreciate your sincere research about your future, but how could I move ahead with your application when you failed to comply with both of the metrics of the counselling session?
23/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I understand there is no other way and there’s no way to my knowledge that I can make up for this. I couldn’t proceed with my application with you because I had no much research in my studies and what I wanted to pursue, no career guidance and people to assist me from my side so I had to withdraw my application and try to find out all the information I could get to have a solid background for my career path. I am sorry for not communicating and not participating as noted in the terms of this program. I hope we could continue on a fresh page and hope for you to understand that this time around I don’t have a double minded decision. 

If there’s is now way we can continue with the application, it will be a great disadvantage for me and a lesson as well.
 Hope we could start on a fresh page and proceed, pardon my manners.
23/01/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: I understand, I will give you another chance at this counselling session.
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 660 7006: Thank you very much
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 660 7006: When do we start?
23/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: I will contact you tomorrow at 10 AM CAT.
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 660 7006: I will be there.
23/01/24, 10:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
