17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Thank you
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes please,  I am looking forward to the opportunity to be independent , further my studies for higher education and indeed I feel it reduces the burden on my parents
17/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Thando, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I believe and have faith in myself and my parents ,that I do have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarships
17/01/24, 10:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

23/01/24, 9:02 am - +263 77 107 2314: Good morning, Sir
23/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why were you inactive yesterday?
23/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 107 2314: Yesterday I was collecting the results at school, alot of students were present and the process ended up taking the entire day for every student to be cleared
23/01/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Please, you could have conveyed to me that you will not be active due to these reasons yesterday?
23/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 107 2314: I apologize sir, it will not happen again ,
23/01/24, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you take chemistry if you wanted to do Mining engineering?
23/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 107 2314: Upon investigation we were told that Mining Engineering required mostly Pure Mathematics and Physics so i used T G instead of Chemistry as a back up that if I didn't perform well in Physics for Mining Engineering I would consider Architectural engineering or Civil Engineering
23/01/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Thando, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 107 2314: Sir, does this mean that I do not have required criteria to study in India
23/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can go ahead with Computer Engineering and Electrical engineering, and also any commercial course since you had maths.
23/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yess I would be interested in Electrical Engineering
23/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 107 2314: I understand
23/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes I am confident in achieving it
23/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Yes I would love that
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

23/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Well what I have understood is that  the course offers a wide variety of options for me as an individual to explore a lot of opportunities in the field and most it offers me a  chance to tap into my creative side as a problem solver to the highest degree, 5 years after completion I see my self work hard to be best in my field , learning a lot , gaining experience to pursue much more intricate sectors in the field. My dream was to become a engineer and mining was the course I saw fit in the engineering sector but I can see that It offers plenty of interesting sectors and that has me curious of how high I can aim as an engineer .My aim is to advance as high as possible in my field so that I can inspire my fellow countrymen that it is possible to achieve your dreams and I plan to also have an impact in my country, raise awareness to young students to take their education seriously.Last but not least I would be able to retire my parents and make them proud for all their hardwork , I can change my family's lives.

23/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 107 2314: Studying abroad has always been a dream of mine, as I admired it and now I have the opportunity to do it.
I feel offers me opportunities to gain work overseas and I would love that
