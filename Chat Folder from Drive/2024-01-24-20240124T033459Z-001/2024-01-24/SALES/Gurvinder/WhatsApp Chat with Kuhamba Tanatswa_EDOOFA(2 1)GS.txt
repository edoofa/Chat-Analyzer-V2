*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 9:32 am - +27 78 814 2121: Morning
03/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Mafunga, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
03/01/24, 10:20 am - +27 78 814 2121: Yes correct
03/01/24, 10:52 am - +27 78 814 2121: Helo
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
03/01/24, 1:59 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Myself I dont have much info if you can right light to me what you offer for my daughter and what are the requirements
03/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Well nothing much, he just sent me a fo online saying it's for a schoolarship form and l saw it as an opportunity and went for it
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Yes because l feel like my parents won't be able to sustain me for my tertiary education but lm someone who is ambitious that's why l went for it
03/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tanatswa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I guess l have
03/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I wasn't available for the counseling session because l did not have data but because l now have it , l will be available
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tanatswa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

03/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 895 7163: There will be a financial strain, my mom cannot support the four of us at once and as you know teritiary fees are very high
03/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: So before knowing about Edoofa, what were your plans financially to pursue higher education?
03/01/24, 3:58 pm - +27 78 814 2121: I am following up as a parent
03/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 8:19 am - +27 78 814 2121: Noted good morning
08/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Mr Mafunga, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  


1. Bachelor in Pharmacy

2. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Technology in Biotechnology Engineering
08/01/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: And if you want Tanatswa to pursue Engineering, I can offer her those courses as well.
08/01/24, 8:51 am - +27 78 814 2121: All is well
08/01/24, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: May I know, which course you want to go ahead with?
08/01/24, 11:41 am - +27 78 814 2121: Bachelor of Science in Medical laboratory technology would do for her
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Tanatswa achieving it.
08/01/24, 11:53 am - +27 78 814 2121: She can achieve that with no doubts
08/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: So Shall I brief you about the course?
08/01/24, 11:55 am - +27 78 814 2121: Yes
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: *Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: *Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
08/01/24, 12:00 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Understood sounds good for her
08/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: As a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Tanatswa, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is she willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way in order to transform her career?
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Will encourage her at length and I do not doubt her capabilities
08/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that she us willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want her to study abroad and not in your country?
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - +27 78 814 2121: In my country they  are under resourced and the facilities es are limited and tuitions are very high.
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for her to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to make her study abroad, but can you share how studying abroad can help her to contribute her learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Surely that will be a great strand considering the shortage of critical skills that will a mile stone and the development of under developed countries there by bringing something that is scarce and improve the health care. In africa we have high shortage of special skills in the health sector.
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mr Mafunga, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Yes I do agree, but they are always pace setter and experience will tell and the needs of the country by that time
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 78 814 2121: That true and India has most of the best doctors operating in African countries. Their experts are transforming African countries.
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

08/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mr Mafunga, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Is the scholarship 100% sponsored
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - +27 78 814 2121: What else is expected from parents in support of the child  and any other expenses is involved.
08/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - +27 78 814 2121: By almeans will try yo meant the requirements. It's only that I and my child we are in different locations
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your situation Mr Mafunga, and I am here to guide you for a better education for your child.

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
09/01/24, 10:16 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Noted
10/01/24, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 9:04 am - +27 78 814 2121: Sure I am ready
10/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/01/24, 10:21 am - +27 78 814 2121: I do understand
10/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
10/01/24, 10:42 am - +27 78 814 2121: Yes please
10/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Mr Mafunga, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/01/24, 11:36 am - +27 78 814 2121: That would be great
10/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
10/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
10/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

10/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
10/01/24, 12:01 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Yes this will be of much benefit considering tatyou will get experience and learning at the same time and exposed to the industry gaining knowledge and being marketable.
10/01/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mr Mafunga, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/01/24, 12:16 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Accordingly surely that would be of great advantage and the Student will try to balance to work hard to balance fees and will not afford to fail as this will take her somewhere else. 

Also the calculations are clearer on how that will be balanced towards the fees <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

10/01/24, 12:36 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Surely this is evident of how other scholars work hard to era and learn. I saw the names are from my native and most are from my country of which there is nothing that can hidder my child to work and learn like other children.
10/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
10/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Sure we're ready
10/01/24, 12:52 pm - +27 78 814 2121: um ready
10/01/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mafunga as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 71 895 7163: A minimum of $3000
10/01/24, 1:02 pm - +27 78 814 2121: $1500 - $2250
10/01/24, 1:03 pm - +27 78 814 2121: for only 5 applications
10/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mr Mafunga, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 1:11 pm - +27 78 814 2121: What is the deadline for this? In December 2024, my daughter will complete her A-levels, after which she will enrol in the first semester of 2025. A reasonable amount could be 350. so the 350 is able to be allocated for the 2025 school year?
10/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: I will explain just now, first, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/01/24, 1:31 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Then is the admission will cover for the multiple application then they are high chances for admissions that wil be super great then.
10/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
10/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mafunga basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/01/24, 2:00 pm - +27 78 814 2121: When will be the enrolment for thee academic year 2025 commencing
10/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Also the admission fee is it due now
10/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it has started.
10/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
10/01/24, 3:48 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Explain the cycle please <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Mafunga, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
10/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
10/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
10/01/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
10/01/24, 4:40 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Yes I am there sorry got caught up on something I am back
10/01/24, 4:41 pm - +27 78 814 2121: I am in light of the program
10/01/24, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
10/01/24, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/01/24, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
10/01/24, 4:44 pm - +27 78 814 2121: How will I be assisted with the budget
10/01/24, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please our Financial Planning Team will contact you for that.
10/01/24, 4:52 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Cool
10/01/24, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/01/24, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/01/24, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Tanatswa* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
12/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Tanatswa’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
12/01/24, 1:35 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Noted with thanx will try as much as I can
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *18th or 19th of January 2024* for $200 and the *18th or 19th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *18th or 19th of January 2024*
Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

13/01/24, 7:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 9:27 am - +27 78 814 2121: Actually present  for the conversation
13/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate the situation?
13/01/24, 10:04 am - +27 78 814 2121: I have got another child the elder sister for stephy she enrolled this January at the University in Zambia and had no funding or schoolarship had to pay for the fee first semester from my own savings.

 As for Stephy I thaught I will have the whole year saving for say  upto August 2024 for her 2025 academic year enrollment.

 I have got twins again doing grade 2 and the other one doing grade 8.
 I pay fee on a monthly bases for them 

  I am trying for all my kids to have proper education. My only concern now is for them all to have affordable education and to be self sustained.

 My situation becomes very tricky especially  when everything is coming at the same time. I just believe God to provide and will be very greatful if the schoolarship fully fund for the education of my children. 

I am that hard working someone and a hand can help at the sametime with the EWYP will as well take me to another level. 

All my children are super intelligent and I know they will never disappoint me at any given time.
13/01/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Mafunga @27788142121 as you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they might be willing to consider your situation and provide, you with a part fee payment plan of $100. Which will have to be completed within the next 7 days to secure your child's seat. You can then pay 2nd $100 to complete the enrollment formalities by the 28th Of January, so that you can arrange that $100. 

That's the maximum I can do for you after looking at your situation right, I hope this will be helpful?
13/01/24, 12:18 pm - +27 78 814 2121: So what is the dealine for the $100 to secure my child seat. <This message was edited>

20/01/24, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: I hope you all must have gone through the Letter of Acceptance properly, so as of now would you like to ask anything from the same please?
20/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 895 7163: Can you please elaborate more on the program you gave me
20/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 71 895 7163: I thought medicine and pharmacy lasts for at least six years
20/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 71 895 7163: But it looks like this one is for being a lab technician but l want to be a doctor
20/01/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Do you recall out discussions during the counselling session @263718957163?
20/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 895 7163: Yes
20/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 895 7163: I was going through them
20/01/24, 11:49 am - +27 78 814 2121: Is it possible to have that what she want as the next choice
20/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: @27788142121 If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.

Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
20/01/24, 1:31 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Stephen at A leve is studying Pure Mathematics, Biology and chemistry
20/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: @27788142121 if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/01/24, 1:42 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Ok let's then consider BSc Medical Laboratory.
20/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I am doing Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics
20/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Aren't the subjects which are needed for one to study medicine
20/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: To study medicine, Biology is the most important subject Tanatswa, without Biology how would one study medicine please?
20/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I thought it's the same as it is done here in Zimbabwe
20/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Okay then lm opting for engineering now
20/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Can you elaborate @263718957163, since this is the first time you are referring to getting your course changed, so may I know what exactly is going on please?
20/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 71 895 7163: It's okay, lm going for cardiology

23/01/24, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Tanatswa, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: But I can still offer you Bachelor in Pharmacy which is a healthcare course, offers a white-collar job, Students who are willing to work around medicines and have a good attitude towards the pharma industry can opt for this course.
