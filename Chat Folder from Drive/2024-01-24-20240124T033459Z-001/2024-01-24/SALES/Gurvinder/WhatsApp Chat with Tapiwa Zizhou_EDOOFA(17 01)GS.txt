17/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Tapiwa!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
17/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Tapiwa Zizhou_EDOOFA(18/01)GS" to "Tapiwa Zizhou_EDOOFA(17/01)GS"
17/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Of course
17/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tapiwa,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
17/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Have been waiting for your response Mr Gurvinder. Looking forward to be talking to you. Thank you very much.
17/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tapiwa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Charlene, is that correct?
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes
17/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Charlene, also do tell me whether you learnt about Charlene’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Sorry for the late replies i am having network problems. Thank very for the question. So from what i heard, Edoofa  is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*, which believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. The  scholarship programmes are  based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to college, training and making them job ready. These were the experiences that i heard from Charlene.
17/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 6:35 pm - +263 71 353 9111: That's very true. That has been an opportunity that even my parents would want. Because even  while I was doing my Advanced Level, there were actually struggling with paying for my school fees. So of course this would even lessen financial burden to them.
17/01/24, 10:06 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

18/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 353 9111: Good Morning.
18/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Tapiwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 353 9111: Yes
18/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tapiwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

19/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 71 353 9111: It has always been my passion to study in medical sciences ever since I was a child. Due to the poor medical facilities and lack of doctors in my country, many people are dying every year because of that.

22/01/24, 9:01 am - +263 71 353 9111: Okay
22/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 71 353 9111: Advanced Level

22/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you take Biology, if you wanted to do Medicine?
22/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 71 353 9111: I wanted to but when I started my A level there wasn't a biology teacher by then so I then turned to physics. I had also been advised that even with physics I could do medicine.
22/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Tapiwa, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  


1. Bachelor in Pharmacy

2. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Technology in Biotechnology Engineering
22/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 353 9111: Okay I understand, I didn't know, so if may ask is it now possible if i could change in my application from medical sciences to engineering then.
22/01/24, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is possible, may I know, which field of engineering are you interested in?
22/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 353 9111: Software Engineering.
22/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:


*B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering*
22/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Exactly that is what I was really would like to do.
22/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
22/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes, I am very confident in it.
22/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
22/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes of course.

22/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
22/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes i have understood.
22/01/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 353 9111: So after five years, l will see my self having a high paying salary job. With this course I will also have multiple job opportunities like being doing Design Engineering, Computer Consultant and Solution Developer amongst others.

22/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Tapiwa I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes  of course, I am more than ready.
22/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 353 9111: I believe studying abroad will make me experience new cultures from other countries, a way to also improve my language skills but above all, to get a better education than in my country.
22/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Okay so I will try to create a better learning environment where there will availability of learning resources like computers. Secondly I would improve the teacher quality and also encourage student empowerments.
22/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tapiwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 353 9111: I agree.
22/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Exactly that is what i was wondering about.
22/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

23/01/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Good Morning
23/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why are you so late for the session?
23/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 353 9111: I really apologize for that, we had a power cut yesterday, my phone ran out of battery so I wasn't able to recharge it
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I understand, so are you available for the session now?
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes
23/01/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 353 9111: No, not at all.
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Okay, I see. So with this *Earn While You Learn Program*, how are the students employed?
23/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Tapiwa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Okay, I see.
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

23/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/01/24, 10:21 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.
