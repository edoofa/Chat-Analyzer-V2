*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 803 8040: A good morning Mr. Gurvinder. Yes you have contacted the right persons. We are Trishon's parents and be free to ask any questions or to shade more light on the scholarship.
23/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Kaombe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 803 8040: Thank you. Noted
23/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Kaombe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Eleanor, is that correct?
23/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 803 8040: Very correct Mr. Gurvinder. I need to understand better.
23/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Eleanor, also do tell me whether you learnt about Eleanor’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 803 8040: We haven't learnt anything yet. We are new to the program. We would want to learn more.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes sir
23/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 537 8218: we would also want to know programs offered by the scholarship for a student who have been doing sciences with a combination of MATHS PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
23/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please let us be patient, as this is a counselling session, you will be guided for everything.
23/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 537 8218: okay noted
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr and Mrs Kaombe, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes we do
23/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Dokora, I would like to know Trishon better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?

  8.   May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?



Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>

Us parrents will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad

Trishon do have siblings which are still in high school

The father of Trishon have a degree in Bachelor Of environment conservation and ecology

23/01/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, in which level are the siblings in?
23/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 537 8218: she is doing her form 4 ordinary level education this year
23/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so do you think she would also like to be part of this program?
23/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 537 8218: yes l think
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 537 8218: Madam Kajau.vcf (file attached)
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 537 8218: the above contact is for the school deputy headmaster of the school
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during Trshon's introduction you mentioned he would like to study Phamarcy, could you please share what motivates him behind this field of study?
23/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 537 8218: Trishon had a passion in pharmacy because he would want to open his phamarcy shops as they are few in our country, especially in our town . There is only one pharmacy shop in our town which can cannot provide for the whole town ,l therefore need to curb this problem.

The other motive is that Pharmacists  on our local hospital are being offered better job opportunities by other big hospitals so they are always vacancies on these small scale hospitals or even bigger ones because of few pharmacists in the country. 
l therefore need this opportunity to study pharmacy because it offers greater employment opportunities too besides being a pharmacy entrepreneur
23/01/24, 10:30 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
