12/01/24, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
12/01/24, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
12/01/24, 4:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

21/01/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Hello Benson, we could not have a proper conversation regarding your Application with Edoofa for the Edoofa scholarship Program as you mostly respond after my working hours which is between *7:30 AM and 4:30 PM CAT*. In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*. In the meantime, I would like you to go through the video link of our student beneficiaries in India.

22/01/24, 7:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/01/24, 8:01 am - +260 769578830: Good morning
22/01/24, 8:01 am - +260 769578830: Am ready
22/01/24, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Benson let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

22/01/24, 12:17 pm - +260 769578830: Is it true that student provide money for their own transport to India
22/01/24, 12:27 pm - +260 769578830: I read the edoofa FAQ document about payments that is the reason I asks about payments I was scared that disadvantaged children can't afford e.g providing there own transport to India and pay registration fee
22/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, but our VISA experts will be their to guide you through the whole process.
22/01/24, 1:35 pm - +260 769578830: Is it not too expensive as in going to India
22/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please that is a one time cost, but in return you are getting a superior education which will give you job opportunities and a respect in your native country.
22/01/24, 2:04 pm - +260 769578830: Sir so there is no one who can help me with that money because at now I can't manage
