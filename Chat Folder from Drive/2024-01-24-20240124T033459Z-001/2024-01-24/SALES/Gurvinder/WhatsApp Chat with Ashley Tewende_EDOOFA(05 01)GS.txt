We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
05/01/24, 8:23 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Hey am now online

08/01/24, 8:22 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 286 3286: What will we have the session
08/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Ashley,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*.
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 286 3286: Ok Mr Gurnvider
08/01/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Ashley, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, is that correct?
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah it's correct
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 286 3286: No l didn't learn about Munashe's journey
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah that what am looking for
08/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ashley, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l can be a able to meet the first one but as for the parents am not sure
08/01/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Noted, may I know, why is that the case?
08/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 286 3286: They rarely spend their time on their fones
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Now Ashley, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

*“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
09/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 286 3286: Owky Mr Gurnvider

God Bless You!
09/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Okay have a great day also
10/01/24, 8:40 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 286 3286: It's ok sir
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Ashley, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
10/01/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
10/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 286 3286: I didn't know and l have never thought of any program to do except for medicine and pharmacy
10/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Considering your interest in pharmacy, exploring a Bachelor's in Biochemistry could offer you a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles governing drugs and their interactions within the human body. While pharmacy focuses on drug dispensing and its application, a degree in Biochemistry delves deeper into the scientific aspects of drugs, exploring their composition, mechanisms of action, and biochemical reactions within biological systems.

Biochemistry as a field not only covers the study of pharmaceuticals but also provides insights into the fundamental molecular processes of life. It equips you with a profound understanding of how biological molecules function, offering a solid foundation in research and development within the pharmaceutical industry. This knowledge is invaluable as it allows you to comprehend drug design, development, and testing processes more thoroughly.

Moreover, a BSc in Biochemistry opens doors to a diverse range of career paths, including pharmaceutical research, biotechnology, healthcare, forensic science, and academia. It provides a versatile skill set applicable across various industries, paving the way for a dynamic and fulfilling career trajectory.
10/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 286 3286: Okay
10/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: So do you think you want go ahead with this course?
10/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah I will go ahead with it
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l will achieve that
10/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
10/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry or B.Sc. Biochemistry (B.Sc. Biochem)* is an undergraduate course in chemical and physio-chemical processes. The course duration is for three years.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. Biochem* is a course through which students can find ample job opportunities in the Medical industry, research labs, agriculture, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions etc. Within these sectors, professionals can find job profiles like that of a Clinical Researcher, Research Scientist, Lecturer, Professor Etc.
 Biochemistry is the study of using Chemical processes and principles in studying biological process and living matter.  It is a branch of science which deals with chemistry which is applied to the study of living organisms and the atoms and molecules which comprise living organisms.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. Biochemistry* studies the structure and function of biochemical molecules. The knowledge acquired and skills learned can be applied to varied fields. Some of the sectors which offer employment to B.Sc. Biochemistry graduates are:

*Medical Industry*
*Agriculture*
*Research Labs*
*Pharmaceutical Companies*
*Academic and educational institutions*
*Biotechnologist.*
*Research Scientist.*
*Clinical Scientist.*
*Research Associates.*
*Chemist.*
*Microbiologist.*
*Biomedical Scientist.*
*Pharmacologist.*
10/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Okay
10/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
10/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l understand it but isn't it to weak because all you need is just two A level passes
10/01/24, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please we have reduced the criteria to two passes for every course after COVID.
10/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Eyy as for me l need a powerful program something that requires 10 points or better and am willing to work to have those points not a program that only needs two A level passes but it's ok
10/01/24, 9:14 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley, Biochemistry is one of the most complex and highly pursued courses, the eligibility criteria was set by us lower than normal as students who have a poor background couldn't cope up with the studies after covid, which made it difficult for us to provide students with equal opportunities so that is why we reduced the eligibility criteria.
10/01/24, 9:17 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok l understand
11/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

11/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l understand
11/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/01/24, 8:23 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 286 3286: We will help others to know they is better education out there and helping other kids to achieve their dreams
15/01/24, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ashley, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l agree
15/01/24, 9:14 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
15/01/24, 9:15 pm - +263 78 286 3286: You too take care <This message was edited>

17/01/24, 9:49 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
22/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 78 286 3286: Ok sir

22/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
22/01/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ashley, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 286 3286: No l don't have anything
22/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 286 3286: No
22/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *B.Sc. Biochemistry* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
22/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
22/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
22/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
22/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
22/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

22/01/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
22/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
22/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ashley, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
22/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l can see
22/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ashley, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
22/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah there are the ones
23/01/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
23/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yes l did
23/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
23/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 286 3286: 1500 -2250
23/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Ashley, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 286 3286: Ok
23/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 286 3286: I think so
23/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 286 3286: What if l fail to reach the expected points of the program when l have already paid my fee

23/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Early enrollment for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early enrollment for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
23/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 286 3286: U said it's a scholarship why paying all these funds
23/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Ashley let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
