12/01/24, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 219 3831: Morning
12/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 219 3831: Indeed
12/01/24, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Marc, also do tell me whether you learnt about Marc’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 219 3831: He didn't tell
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 219 3831: Okay
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 219 3831: That's true
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 219 3831: Interesting
12/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tadisa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 219 3831: I do
12/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tadisa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

17/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 352 0434: Thank you
17/01/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

22/01/24, 11:40 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
23/01/24, 7:12 am - +263 78 219 3831: Morning
23/01/24, 8:06 am - +263 78 219 3831: Viruses may seem scary but studying them is actually beneficial.lf the scholarship is a success l would hope to be leading
expert in the field of virology by the next five years.  I would be working on cutting-edge research to develop new treatments and vaccines for viral diseases.  I would be collaborating with other scientists from around the world to share ideas and advance our understanding of viruses.  I would also be educating the public about the importance of viruses and the role they play in our lives.  And finally, I would be working to promote biosecurity and biosafety measures to protect the public from the potential risks of viruses. I also hope to see a paradigm shift in the way we study and understand viruses.  Instead of focusing solely on disease, I would like to see a greater emphasis on the potential benefits of viruses.  For example, some viruses can be used to treat cancer, and others can be harnessed to produce biofuels and other renewable resources.  I would also like to see more collaboration between different scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and computer science, to better understand the complex nature of viruses.  This could lead to exciting new discoveries . Not forgetting to support my family financially and take over the responsibility of my sister's education ....
