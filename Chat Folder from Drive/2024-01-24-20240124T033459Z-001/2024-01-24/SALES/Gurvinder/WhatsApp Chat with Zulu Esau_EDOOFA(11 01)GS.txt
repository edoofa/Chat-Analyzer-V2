You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
11/01/24, 1:21 pm - +260 96 8635206: Alright Mr Gurvinder and it's a pleasure to me too
11/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Chiwatah, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Mphatso, is that correct?
11/01/24, 1:56 pm - +260 96 8635206: Yes i did
11/01/24, 1:56 pm - +260 96 8635206: And i quickly gained interest

11/01/24, 10:09 pm - +260 96 8635206: Alright Mr Gurvinder
12/01/24, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 10:02 am - +260 96 8635206: Good morning and we are delighted to participate
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 96 8635206: Yes very much
12/01/24, 11:28 am - +260 96 8635206: Wow this really sounds great! so due to the stiff competition what are the requirements
12/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chiwatah, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 12:11 pm - +260 96 8635206: Most definitely Mr Gurvinder
12/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chiwatah, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 96 8635206: Okay so my name is Chiwatah Esau Ackson Zulu but on my School ID I only use the name Esau Ackson Zulu, im Zambian I did my primary education at Nileleni pre and primary school(a school located in kasama, Northern Province ) then I did my secondary education which is my highest level of education from St Francis Secondary School which is located in Northern Province in the outskirts of a district called Kasama inclusive of additional mathematics and pure sciences and on the fees we used to pay two thousand and five hundred kwache per term. I aspire to study medicine with the vision of becoming a surgical Doctor.

12/01/24, 11:05 pm - +260 96 8635206: God bless you too Sir
13/01/24, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 10:14 am - +260 97 7635206: Good morning thanks
13/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Well Chiwatah as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
13/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*3. Bachelors in Optometry*
*4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
13/01/24, 11:25 am - +260 96 8635206: Well it's really unfortunate so do you offer Engineering then?
13/01/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Yes, we do, may I know, in which field of engineering are you interested in?
13/01/24, 12:19 pm - +260 96 8635206: Civil Engineering?
13/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

15/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
15/01/24, 11:07 am - +260 96 8635206: Surething Sir
15/01/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
15/01/24, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
15/01/24, 11:19 am - +260 96 8635206: So sir are these engineering companies also in connection with your program
15/01/24, 11:19 am - +260 96 8635206: And mind running me through electrical engineering too?
15/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Please there are the areas where Civil Engineers are needed, not companies.
15/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate your question.
15/01/24, 11:24 am - +260 96 8635206: Oh alright
15/01/24, 11:25 am - +260 96 8635206: I was asking if you may kindly talk about Electrical engineering too.. If you don't mind
15/01/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Noted we offer *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*.
15/01/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Electrical Engineering has very good career opportunities in professional career such as all power generation, transmission; distribution companies can offer them a very good remuneration as per their skills. Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
15/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 96 8635206: Interesting
15/01/24, 11:28 am - +260 96 8635206: Okay Sir I'm strongly going for this
15/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: So you want to go ahead with *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*?
15/01/24, 11:53 am - +260 96 8635206: Yes sir
15/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
15/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
15/01/24, 2:41 pm - +260 96 8635206: Quite well actually
15/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 3:01 pm - +260 96 8635206: We'll to begin with Sir, once I manage to get into the course and complete. I see myself to have high knowledge about the course and with this I will willingly perfect my skills of the course as a way of helping the state in the development of its electrical and technological sector. Secondly me getting into this Program may most definitely enable me to achieve not only my dreams but my parents' too, in a sense where I might see myself reciprocating the hardwork they ventured into me attaining my education by making them proud. And it could also make me achieve my longtime dream of entangling my studies in a more diverse country such as India.
15/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chiwatah I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 3:05 pm - +260 96 8635206: Most definitely Sir
15/01/24, 9:51 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

16/01/24, 12:09 pm - +260 96 8635206: Sir maybe you've got it wrong I've been very active since the beginning. You might as well look at yesterdays conversation
16/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
16/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 12:48 pm - +260 96 8635206: To begin with Sir, Studying in my Country isn't all that good normally the major difficulty many face is the lack of well recognised Universities as normally there is biasness in the selection of students
Secondly, As you may know Zambia is a small landlocked country therefore our tools of knowledge and resources are normally captivated in a sense where many fail to exploit their fields of career thus giving me a chance to study Abroad will give me a more diverse atmosphere to exploit resources ventured in my field and gain more experience Sir.
16/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 1:09 pm - +260 96 8635206: Well Sir, indeed I am aiming for maximum exposure in my life and if I do proceed abroad I may contribute to the education system in my country by efficient implementation of the skills and knowledge I have gained from my experience abroad to students who too may have a foresighted vision and henceforth giving them a wider source of information.
16/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chiwatah, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 1:52 pm - +260 96 8635206: Indeed I do agree but again a conducive environment can be based on ones mentality and mindset.
Don't you think Sir?
16/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 2:10 pm - +260 96 8635206: Very true.... Edoofa is only in recommendation with India is that so or there are more but India is top tier
16/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
16/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

16/01/24, 2:22 pm - +260 96 8635206: Wow your program really indulges on the best Mr Gurvinder. And from this information India really is the best target.
"You build for India you build for the world indeed"
16/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now Chiwatah, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/01/24, 2:27 pm - +260 96 8635206: Hmmm well Mr Gurvinder you're quite a good explainer and I've gotten to understand much so fortunately Its all clear and no query Sir.
16/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 2:29 pm - +260 96 8635206: Not quite Sir, mind shading more light on this.
16/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/01/24, 2:33 pm - +260 96 8635206: Wow I'm really loving the sound of your program Sir and the Transport fee sir?
16/01/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Please the accomodations are generally inside the campus, so there is no need for transport fee.
16/01/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/01/24, 2:46 pm - +260 96 8635206: Most definitely sir
16/01/24, 2:47 pm - +260 97 7635206: Very impressive indeed
16/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Chiwatah, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/01/24, 2:59 pm - +260 96 8635206: Amazing so the tasks are given after a specific time range for instance after certain weeks or months?
16/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that depends on task to task.
16/01/24, 3:01 pm - +260 96 8635206: Interesting
16/01/24, 3:03 pm - +260 96 8635206: I actually follow your Edoofa Instagram account and I've seen your program has brought alot of smiles to many Africans which is really dazzling.
16/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great.
16/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
16/01/24, 3:06 pm - +260 96 8635206: Indeed it is Sir

16/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 96 8635206: With a wide range of activities and motivational words from the webinars, I'm positive  it will.
16/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Chiwatah, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_ <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 3:16 pm - +260 96 8635206: Loud and clear sir
16/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 96 8635206: You are really different and unique and this is something I would eagerly look for regarding my international education
16/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 96 8635206: Wonderful
16/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chiwatah, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/01/24, 3:23 pm - +260 96 8635206: Most definitely Sir.
16/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
16/01/24, 3:26 pm - +260 96 8635206: Actually I have and as they too are in this group they have understood most of the information you've been highlighting
16/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 96 8635206: Yes Sir!.
16/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Chiwataha as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 3:36 pm - +260 96 8635206: It would be  estimated in the range $1,500 to $2250
Isn't it sir
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 7635206: Am following too
16/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Chiwatah, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 3:56 pm - +260 96 8635206: Wonderful
16/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/01/24, 3:58 pm - +260 96 8635206: I definitely do Sir
16/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 96 8635206: Wow I love your programs flexibility
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
16/01/24, 4:05 pm - +260 96 8635206: Uhmm no sir
16/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chiwatah, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
16/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/01/24, 4:10 pm - +260 96 8635206: Yes yes

17/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Hello @260977635206 @260968635206 .

17/01/24, 10:30 am - +260 97 7635206: Good morning thanks. We had time together to go through the  FAQ and we have an insight about the program
17/01/24, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
17/01/24, 10:40 am - +260 97 7635206: I think everything was explained
17/01/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
17/01/24, 10:46 am - +260 97 7635206: When is the enrolment fee due
17/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Please, that will be 7 days after the candidate has been found eligible for the program.
17/01/24, 10:53 am - +260 97 7635206: Noted Sir.
17/01/24, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: So @260977635206, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @260968635206 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

3. Ranging between $6000 to $8000
4.$2000 to $3000
5.$350 within 7 days if found eligible 
6. So Sir from what ive understood is that the Earn while you learn programs allows candidates to earn credits through assignments and tasks.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *23rd or 24th of January 2024* for $200 and the *23rd or 24th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *23rd or 24th of January 2024*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

LIFE IN RWANDA 16 YEARS AFTER THE GENOCIDE 

To begin with, The Republic of Rwanda is a peaceful landlocked country situated in Africa. It is mostly known for its incredible breathtaking scenary. It is oftenly refered to as the land of a thousand hills or as they call it in French "le pays des mille collines."

Now Sixteen years after genocide, Rwanda has emerged as a nation focused on healing, reconstruction, and sustainable development. The scars of the 1994 genocide are not forgotten, but the resilience of the Rwandan people has paved the way for a renewed sense of national identity and progress.

Reconciliation has been a cornerstone of Rwanda's journey. The government's commitment to justice through the Gacaca courts has played a vital role in addressing the atrocities of the past while fostering community healing. The emphasis on unity and rebuilding social bonds has created a more cohesive society, even as survivors and perpetrators coexist in shared communities. This commitment to reconciliation has been crucial in shaping the social fabric of contemporary Rwanda.

Economically, Rwanda has experienced a significant transformation. The government's strategic vision has focused on diversifying the economy and investing in key sectors. The capital city, Kigali, now stands as a testament to this economic shift, with modern infrastructure, thriving businesses, and a burgeoning tech scene. Agricultural reforms have also contributed to economic growth, ensuring sustainable practices and increased productivity.

Education has been a priority for Rwanda's leadership, recognizing it as a catalyst for societal change. Efforts to improve access to education and enhance the quality of learning have resulted in a more educated and informed populace. The focus on education extends beyond academics, promoting values of unity, tolerance, and critical thinking, laying the foundation for a brighter future.

Environmental sustainability has become a central concern for Rwanda. The country has actively engaged in initiatives to preserve its rich biodiversity and combat environmental degradation. Tree planting campaigns and conservation efforts showcase a commitment to responsible stewardship of the natural resources that are crucial for the nation's long-term well-being.

Socially, Rwanda has made strides in gender equality and inclusivity. Women's participation in various sectors, including politics and business, has increased, contributing to a more balanced and equitable society. Initiatives to support survivors of the genocide and address mental health challenges have been instrumental in the healing process, though the psychological scars of such a traumatic past remain a poignant aspect of daily life for many.

Challenges persist, reminding Rwanda that the journey to lasting recovery is ongoing. Economic disparities, the need for continued reconciliation, and the importance of addressing mental health issues underscore the complexities of the post-genocide landscape. However, the nation's progress is undeniable, and the world looks to Rwanda as a beacon of hope and resilience.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, is marked by a commitment to various aspects such as reconciliation, economic growth, educational advancement, environmental sustainability, and social inclusivity. While challenges persist, the nation's transformative journey stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people and their collective determination to build a more prosperous and harmonious future.

23/01/24, 10:37 am - +260 97 7635206: Just for clarity sake. Is the course fee and registration fee same
23/01/24, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Please, the registration fee is a part of the University tuition fees and is not an extra cost, the registration fee depends on the University itself.
23/01/24, 11:34 am - +260 97 7635206: Noted thanks
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions you want to ask?
23/01/24, 12:21 pm - +260 97 7635206: For now no more questions Sir
23/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, when is the first deadline?
23/01/24, 1:22 pm - +260 97 7635206: 29th January
23/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, so can you give me a tentative date for when are you going to fulfil the enrollment formalities so that I can inform the Admissions team beforehand so that they can start your admissions process in 24-48 hours after the completion of enrollment formalities?
23/01/24, 1:47 pm - +260 97 7635206: 26th January
23/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so are you clear about the payment methods?
23/01/24, 1:48 pm - +260 97 7635206: Yes Sir
23/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @260977635206 , since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zambia

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 97 7635206: Brief me on Direct Bank Transfer
23/01/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge. 

The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been im
23/01/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-
