I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 460 6508: Morning  sir ,this Edoofa schoolarship Program but I perceive this as a once in a lifetime apportunity that is being presented to not only me but to various  students around the world to be able to study I'm India not only that but also channels students forwards a worthy course n career .it offers schoolarships ranging from 50- 100% of tuition fees.The schoolarship is reliable and the proof is in those l have seen being upheld by this schoolarship from my former school.Edoofa schoolarship program  also encourages  focusing on building relevant skills which helps the students to thrive and survive in the future.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 460 6508: Alright
23/01/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 77 460 6508: Yes , no doubt sir
23/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Sinclaire, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 460 6508: Yes sir
23/01/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Now Sinclaire, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

23/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Well sir , my choice is being propelled by the desire to  make a difference which is not indirect  but rather a direct one , what difference  could  be more direct than helping  to save people's lives, alleviating their pain and suffering . There is no doubt there will be more of it , we have seen how diseases and malfunctions are increasing  by day  ,we have seen pandemics like Covid -19 .....there is no guarantee  that there won't be any such tragic events ...so l hv took it upon myself to be part of the "rescue team"

2023(form 6)
23/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Sinclaire, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry
23/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I see , does this mean l have to choose only from the above sir?
23/01/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Alright , no problem
23/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I seek permission to research a little on the given options ..10-15 minutes...may l?
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, you can.
23/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 460 6508: I have decided on 

4.Bachelor of science in Cardiovascular technology
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Fortunately l was able to attain all As in my final Advanced level examinations
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, so shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Sure

23/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Following
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
23/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Yes, l did
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Sure ...
23/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Bsc cardiovascular Technology , being a prestigious and opportunity-rich course ,l see myself in the midst of of reaching deeper depths in the post-course programs .l intend to do this while working  and l assume it may be difficult but l know  l have what it takes as l am a very hardworking somebody .l also recognise the high amount of income that comes with this carrer path and l visualise myself in a position to cater to my aging parents as well as financially  assisting  mu siblings  in their pursuit of careers of their own .Upon completion of higher courses ,l look forward to  developing of an institution which specialises in this cardiovascular technology sector because my mission  is to be more than just a cardiovascular technologist but l aim to sparehead an institution which would have a great impact whether in India or any other place I may reside.Lastly l believe all these ambitions would be made easier if l am part of the Edoofa's program.This is because l will be granted the opportunity to acquire knowledge in the best way l have ever known, "hands on knowledge "..and would be able to earn while l learn which would help me in being more independent  and simply the opportunity to experience the various cultures of students around the world included in the program. So it is by no doubt , get into the Edoofa's program would be a pivotal part in awakening my dreams .
23/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Sinclaire I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 460 6508: 250% sir , working hard is the only way l have known to live
23/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 460 6508: The issue is on my age , as I am growing  l seek not only tertiary education  l also seek exposure and more importantly  independence  .This has been difficult  as this independence comes with economic stability,  economic stability which comes from working  , well atleast  for a student part time working  and sadly  such opportunities  are scarce here in my country and l figured studying abroad would not only provided me with knowledge  but also a less' slim opportunity to earn  and this was the case even before I got a chance to know about  your program which is amazing because  it clearly  states "earn while you learn " which was something l was anticipating to work on it alone rather than a wonderful platform offering opportunities.
23/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Another issue involves  less seats offered per year
23/01/24, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 460 6508: Good question sir , lucky it is something  that l as a young person have thought of and came to a conclusion that later on when I am most likely to take up a tutor or teaching  role and not only that but to also try and source donations - equipment  mainly which is short in our country  and the institution  I mentioned earlier would be the main source  of these funds
