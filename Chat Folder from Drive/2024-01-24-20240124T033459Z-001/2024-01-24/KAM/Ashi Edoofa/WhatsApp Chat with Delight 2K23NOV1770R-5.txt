19/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 78 092 6942: I have not received any mail from the University yet.
19/12/23, 6:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, From our records the university must have mailed you the offer letter, could you please check your inbox?

19/12/23, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I'll ask them to share your offer letter on the above email address.
19/12/23, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 78 537 8639: Evening  we are   good
19/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 78 537 8639: We are just  waiting  to here more  is there  is a room for selection .
19/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 78 537 8639: Selection  of universities  you recommend
19/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
19/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
19/12/23, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/12/23, 7:06 PM - +263 78 092 6942: Noted
19/12/23, 7:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/12/23, 7:08 PM - +263 78 092 6942: Yes I am aware of it
19/12/23, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
19/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 78 092 6942: Yes I have researched a little about the University
19/12/23, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
19/12/23, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
19/12/23, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India.

If you are planning to make the payment through Mr. Rajan in that case the transfer charges rate are 7 %. For better understanding, If you are making a deposit of $450 in that case you need to add $32 for the international transfer charges.

19/12/23, 9:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, If you are comfortable in making the payment through Mr. Charles then the transfer charges rate are 12.5%. If you are planning to make a transfer of $450 in that case you need to add $57 for the international transfer charges.
