20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you for being with us through out most of the admission process Mr. Shivjeet. Wishing you all the best
26/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dalitso ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Good afternoon. I am available and ready to proceed with today's session
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265999965101. Before we start our session for today, we kindly request you to share the following documents for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:53 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: As for the O-level results, I never wrote JCE as it was temporarily suspended by the government during my time
26/12/23, 2:58 PM - +265 888 89 92 09: The highest Malawi Government examination at Secondary (High) School is Malawi School Certificate Examination (MSCE).  This is equivalent to O- level.
26/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above documents with me.
26/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the JCE Results, if you did not appear for your exams due to their cancellation, you will need to obtain a letter from your school. This letter should confirm that the JCE exams were not held, but you successfully completed your JCE, listing the subjects you studied in school. May I know if you have such a letter with you or if you will have to secure it from the school?
26/12/23, 3:18 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: We will have to secure it from the school
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265999965101, Kindly contact them for the document please.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 3:35 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much for this opportunity
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: May I ask when am I scheduled to start the EWYL program?
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, I will be assisting you regarding the EWYL journey soon.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 4:25 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I have gone through the benefits and we may proceed
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 4:45 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: This is really a huge benefit.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:53 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: It is very clear and pleasing to know this ahead of time
26/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
26/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 5:01 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes it is clear as well
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 5:08 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand the instructions and I'm sure my parents are clear on the same as well.
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:10 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I do not have any queried so for. We may proceed
26/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 5:17 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am excited and ready to complete the next steps
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
26/12/23, 5:28 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much and we shall be patiently waiting for the updates.
26/12/23, 5:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265999965101,. On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
26/12/23, 5:41 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Wishing you a blessed week as well.

I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you have the remaining part of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee which is due by 14th December 2023.

As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
13/1/24, 9:33 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: It is truly amazing
13/1/24, 9:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

13/1/24, 9:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 9:39 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes it is clear
13/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up.

13/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 9:45 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I have understood the breakdown.
13/1/24, 9:46 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am also glad to begin the orientation on how to utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program. We may proceed
13/1/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
13/1/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
13/1/24, 9:49 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes it is clear
13/1/24, 9:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
13/1/24, 11:05 AM - +265 888 89 92 09: Yes, it does help demonstrate how the EWYL can be advantageous and minimize the financial strain
13/1/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
13/1/24, 11:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
13/1/24, 11:19 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Does that mean we are only required to pay $500 for the first year?
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265888899209 Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 26th, 2024*.
13/1/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
13/1/24, 11:28 AM - +265 888 89 92 09: Please explain how this works
13/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 26th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 26th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
13/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 26th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
13/1/24, 11:33 AM - +265 888 89 92 09: Yes, it is clear.  We  will pay in two installments
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
13/1/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
13/1/24, 11:39 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: We reside in Lilongwe, Malawi
13/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash
13/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
13/1/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
13/1/24, 11:59 AM - +265 888 89 92 09: We will make the payment through bank transfer from Lilongwe, Malawi direct to the account indicated  on the offer letter
13/1/24, 12:00 PM - +265 888 89 92 09: This is how we did it with the previous payment
14/1/24, 2:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dalitso, Wishing you a good day!
14/1/24, 2:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you at the earliest, as I have been occupied by an urgent meeting. I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session on Monday at 12:00 Pm. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
14/1/24, 7:05 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?

👆
I don't understand this, you are saying Dalitso's annual cost is $1500 and you are taking out the $1000 registration fee leaving a balance of $500 as what he needs to pay. At the same time you are saying he needs to pay $900 as registration fee which has a deadline of 26 January 2024. Could you please clarify?
14/1/24, 8:12 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Should we expect offer letters from other Universities to enable Dalitso make a choice?
15/1/24, 8:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dalitso, Wishing you a good day!
15/1/24, 8:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with us, In regards to the same I would like to know if you are available now for the discussion, I am looking forward to assist your doubts. May I know if you are available?
15/1/24, 8:51 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am available
15/1/24, 8:56 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Good morning
Yes, we can discuss
15/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you are available for the discussion. Let me address your first query about the registration fees, According to the offer letter shared by the MVN University the annual fees for the first year is $1500. Additionally, there is a registration fees which will be needed in order to secure your scholarship seat however as you are an edoofian you have an advantage as for you this registration fees is not an additional cost for you. The registration fees will be adjusted in your admission fees which means when you will pay $1000 for the registration fees you will have a balance of $500 for your tuition fees which will be paid before your arrival. 

Coming back to the registration fees, let me also share that you have a $100 grant for the fees which means you will be needed to pay $900 for the registration fees. In order to make sure that you can complete the registration process smoothly and plan your finances. We have shared the payment plan with you. If you have any doubt regarding the fees, please do let me know.
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Thank you for elaborating. I have understood
15/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome, Now coming back to the payment methods. I would like to know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan contact detail ?
15/1/24, 9:28 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: There is one query remaining to be responded to, that of offer letters from other Universities
15/1/24, 9:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/1/24, 9:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/1/24, 10:18 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Yes, I am clear. I was asking because in the beginning we were told that a student can receive multiple offer letters from different Universities thereby giving an opportunity for a student to choose. However, the point I was driving at is that MVN University has given a timeframe within which registration fee must be paid in order to secure the scholarship. Now what happens if one receives more attractive offers than MVN after registration fee has been paid to MVN University?
15/1/24, 10:19 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Not that we have a particular University in mind
15/1/24, 10:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for making me understand about your point clearly, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN , you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/1/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999953721 Are we still connected ?
15/1/24, 12:08 PM - +265 999 95 37 21: Yes, I am still connected. Sorry I had to attend to a visitor.

Not that we want to lose the MVN University opportunity but I was just trying to get information to be well informed.

No, I am not aware of the transfer option. Is this transfer between Universities or between courses within the same University?
15/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/1/24, 12:23 PM - +265 999 95 37 21: Yes, I am clear
15/1/24, 12:23 PM - +265 999 95 37 21: Thank you for your explanation
15/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265999953721, Shall we continue with the payment modes ?
15/1/24, 1:17 PM - +265 999 95 37 21: As for the payment modes, we already indicated that we will do an electronic bank transfer into the indicated account and that we will do it in two instalments
15/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I have no queries
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: May you please share the university insights
