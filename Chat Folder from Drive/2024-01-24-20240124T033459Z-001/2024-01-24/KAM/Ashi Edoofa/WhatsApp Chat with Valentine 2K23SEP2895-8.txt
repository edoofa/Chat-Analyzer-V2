6/1/24, 7:06 AM - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 9:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 10:08 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Good morning 
Thank you so much for the wonderful good news
6/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:10 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes please
6/1/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:20 AM - +27 71 622 8502: 1. $350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$250
5.$1000
6/1/24, 10:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 10:23 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes it is
6/1/24, 10:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 10:31 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes this does , thank you
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you for the information
6/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 83 499 2115: It is highly appreciated
6/1/24, 10:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27834992115, Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 10:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes it is very clear , thank you so much
6/1/24, 10:49 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 10:52 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes and it is amazing how the EWYL program will assist.
6/1/24, 10:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 10:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - +27 71 622 8502: You are very clear , thank you for wonderful information
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, dear. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850 . Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 71 622 8502: May I please know the consequences with failure to pay the remainder within 3 days
6/1/24, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Let me share that there's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you for the information Officer. We may proceed
6/1/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @27716228502. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 19th, 2024*.
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 11:16 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes please
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th 2024, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - +27 71 622 8502: Everything is clear Officer , thank you so much for such information
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that dear. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - +27 83 499 2115: We are currently residing in South Africa
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 11:39 AM - +27 83 499 2115: I understand thank you for the information
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please do let me know which method is convenient for you.
6/1/24, 11:47 AM - +27 71 622 8502: I think we will use our previous method to deposit through Mama Money but if there is any change I will let you know.
6/1/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27716228502. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - +27 71 622 8502: There are no queries for now , although, I will go through our conversation again and make sure I am not missing out anything. According to more discussions ,I will see if there will be any queries.
6/1/24, 11:54 AM - +27 71 622 8502: We may proceed
6/1/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
9/1/24, 4:23 PM - +27 83 499 2115: Good afternoon, yes we are still going through the offer letter. We are very excited with the opportunity

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
9/1/24, 7:39 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Ms Ashi. The offer letter brought happiness to my family as this is a great opportunity no African child would like to miss. My parents were very happy with this achievement to this point. 

Although I'm sad to say that during our conversations , the worries which upsets almost everyone lied on finances. No parent would like to see their children missing this opportunity ,but they did everything in their reach to think of how to get the registration fee. The results were all negative.
9/1/24, 7:39 PM - +27 71 622 8502: We reached out for Edoofa because we did not have anything, but as we all know that education is the key to change my family's condition of which I'm sure you can also agree with me, we did not lose hope. My performance in school are excellent but money is the problem , I fear that we will not be able to meet the deadlines so that we can reserve our position at MVN university which is sad
9/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Although, as your mentioned that you have financial concern at the moment,  I appreciate that you have shared this with full honesty. 

Being your admission officer, I want to share that you have always shown your dedication for this journey. Considering the challenge you have mentioned, I would like to understand what are your plans to overcome them, Could you please let me know ?
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I had also looked out for jobs since the last day of our exams.Incase  if I would need to take a loan , I was going to do it with confidence that I would be able to pay it back ,however, it is unfortunate that here in Africa getting a job fresh from highschool is almost impossible since more experienced people are unemployed.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - +27 71 622 8502: In order to reserve my position at  MVN university I am requesting for assistance.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I apologize for my very late reply due to instability of network at my side today.

23/1/24, 11:13 AM - +27 71 622 8502: 1. Due to the issue of permits in SA my parents are not working. There were not able to save some money for my registration. And to be honest , they barely get an income to support me and my siblings. There were no issues regarding the opportunity but money is not there, we tried calling out to relatives but the replies were negative. We were busy with sponsors but I am sure you can agree with that it is a long process to gain trust from the sponsor. 

2. I think our best idea was , as a family,  we continue doing some piece work around town , I myself , will be continuing with the EWYL program and also I have found some people who need assistance in their school work , I can assist them for a bit of income. However I am afraid to not being able to guarantee the amount at a specific time but I am sure that with hard work we might afford my flight as this is my responsibility too. 

3. With my challenges , I request assistance in securing this opportunity. In this way , you would have lessen my burden so that I can focus and work towards my flight. And I would also love to hear from your suggestions on how you might help the best. 
Please admission Officer!
