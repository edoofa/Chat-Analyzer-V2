27/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Question 3

Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) is a set of principles and guidelines that ensure the quality, reliability, and integrity of non-clinical laboratory studies. GLP provides a standardized framework for conducting and reporting laboratory studies, particularly those related to the safety assessment of chemicals, drugs, medical devices, and other products.

GLP is followed in the laboratory for several reasons:

1. Quality Assurance: GLP ensures that laboratory studies are conducted in a consistent and reliable manner, with adequate controls and standardized procedures. It emphasizes the importance of well-documented protocols, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and quality control measures to minimize errors and maintain data integrity.

2. Data Integrity and Traceability: GLP requires proper documentation of all laboratory activities, including study protocols, raw data, observations, calculations, and test results. This documentation ensures the traceability and reproducibility of the study, allowing for verification and audit of the results. It helps to prevent data manipulation or falsification and promotes transparency and accountability.

3. Credibility and Acceptance of Results: GLP-compliant studies are recognized and accepted by regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Following GLP guidelines enhances the credibility and reliability of the study data, increasing the chances of regulatory approval for new products or substances.

4.Risk Assessment and Safety Evaluation: GLP supports the accurate assessment of the safety and potential risks associated with chemicals, drugs, or other substances. By adhering to GLP standards, laboratories can generate data that accurately reflects the effects of a substance and its potential hazards, helping regulatory agencies and decision-makers to make informed judgments about the safety
27/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Question 4
In laboratory settings, sterilization methods are crucial for maintaining aseptic conditions and preventing the growth and spread of microorganisms. These methods are employed to eliminate or kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other potential contaminants. Here are some commonly used sterilization methods in labs:

1. Autoclaving: Autoclaving is a widely used sterilization method that utilizes high-pressure steam to kill microorganisms. The typical conditions for autoclaving involve subjecting the material to temperatures of around 121 degrees Celsius (250 degrees Fahrenheit) at high pressure for a specific duration. This process effectively destroys bacteria, spores, and other pathogens. Autoclaving is commonly used for sterilizing laboratory glassware, media, surgical instruments, and heat-resistant materials.

2. Dry Heat Sterilization: Dry heat sterilization involves exposing materials to high temperatures without the presence of moisture. This method is suitable for items that can withstand elevated temperatures, such as glassware, metal instruments, and certain powders. The process typically requires temperatures ranging from 160 to 190 degrees Celsius (320 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit) for a prolonged period, typically 1 to 2 hours, to achieve effective sterilization.

3. Filtration: Filtration is a sterilization method used for heat-sensitive liquids or gases. It involves passing the substance through a filter with tiny pores that can trap and remove microorganisms while allowing the sterile liquid or gas to pass through. This method is commonly employed for sterilizing culture media, enzymes, vaccines, and other heat-sensitive solutions.

4. Chemical Sterilization: Chemical sterilization involves the use of specific chemicals or gases to destroy or inactivate microorganisms
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Question 5

When it comes to placing unique samples under a microscope, there are several good techniques you can employ to ensure proper positioning and observation. Here are a few commonly used techniques:

1. Microscope Slides: Microscope slides are thin, flat glass plates on which samples are placed for observation. To position a unique sample, you can apply a small amount of adhesive or mounting medium to the slide and carefully place the sample on it. The sample can then be covered with a cover slip to protect it and provide a flat surface for observation.

2. Wet Mount Technique: This technique is suitable for observing samples in a liquid medium, such as living organisms or suspended particles. A drop of the liquid containing the sample is placed on a microscope slide, and a cover slip is gently lowered onto the drop, avoiding the formation of air bubbles. The liquid helps keep the sample hydrated and allows for observation of dynamic processes.

3. Staining: Staining is a technique used to enhance the visibility of certain structures within a sample. It involves applying specific dyes or stains to the sample, which selectively bind to different components, making them more visible under the microscope. Staining techniques can be used for various samples, including cells, tissues, and microorganisms.

4. Microtome Sectioning: For larger samples or solid materials, microtome sectioning is employed. A microtome is a device that allows for the cutting of thin and precise sections of the sample. The sample is embedded in a supporting material, such as paraffin wax or resin, which provides stability and facilitates cutting. The microtome slices the sample into thin sections, which are then mounted on microscope slides for observation.
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have finished
27/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
27/12/23, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to know if you are connected with your EWYL mentor, Could you please let me know?
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have no mentor

28/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Afternoon ma'am!
We are all well and fit
28/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263778723523, May I know if you have completed the EWYL form?
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes let me send
28/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 872 3523: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the form with us, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma in Medical Lab. Technology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes the information is correct
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Alright
28/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I understand
28/12/23, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 9:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I was looking forward for your response, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 9:52 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Same to you
28/12/23, 9:53 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Thank you for the great information.I have understand the procedure
29/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawananyasha, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Afternoon ma'am

We are ready for the session
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes I'm following
29/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
29/12/23, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I understand

Ohhh that is why you said I ranges from 2000 to 3000 dollars
29/12/23, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Noted
29/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have understand
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Noted with thanks
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Is there limitations of people on the EWYL
29/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Oohh okay
29/12/23, 2:48 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have no queries
29/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, There is no limitation
29/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:50 PM - +263 77 872 3523: We are all glad
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Lovely Edoofians
29/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I'm following

29/12/23, 5:37 PM - +263 77 269 3957: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 5:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above documents with us, Kindly share your A level and O level document as well.
29/12/23, 5:47 PM - +263 77 269 3957: She is yet to receive her O level final results within the next one and half months or so, that's why we have attached the latest school report.
29/12/23, 5:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Well Understood @263772693957, I am sure you must have the statement of entry for O level right?
29/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 77 269 3957: Yes, let me check with @263778723523
29/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I will check later I'm not at home
29/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to share your response with us.
29/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Alright ma'am
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/12/23, 7:07 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have reviewed them
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 872 3523: So this means the seat will be secured after letter offer from Universities
29/12/23, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263778723523
29/12/23, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 7:28 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes it has resonated
29/12/23, 7:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/12/23, 7:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 7:39 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have understand the benefit
29/12/23, 7:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 77 872 3523: I have understood as far we are
29/12/23, 7:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes I am so glad that I can't wait to receive the offer letter from Universities which grants me the way forward of securing my sit
29/12/23, 7:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
29/12/23, 7:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
29/12/23, 7:54 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Alright thank you for you support
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Please make sure to share your O level document as it's needed in order to proceed with your application.
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Alright ma'am 

I will share them as soon as I reach home
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU University admission formalities.
18/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 269 3957: Well noted. Thank you
18/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawananyasha,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 269 3957: Greetings, We are so excited as a family.
18/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Alright ma'am
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
18/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 872 3523: 1.75USD
2.3 years
3.200USD
4.700USD
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
18/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes it's clear ma'am
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
18/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Off-Campus is awesome
18/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes it's clear
18/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 31st, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
18/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 872 3523: So far so good
18/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 269 3957: Yes, you may go ahead and explain it.
18/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 31st, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 31st, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Ooh I have recalled now
18/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes we on the same ground
18/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 269 3957: We are in Norton, that is, just 40km from the capital of Harare.
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Well noted
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 872 3523: Yes ma'am you can share
18/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 269 3957: Any referees of Students whom he has assisted in this.
18/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772693957 A lot of our students make their payment through Mr. Rajan, please don't worry
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 269 3957: That's fine
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 269 3957: Very clear
18/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 77 269 3957: I think some of the questions I had have been answered during the discussion. Thus, if I think of any other question, I will let you know.
18/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 77 269 3957: So far so goods
18/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
18/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
