8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes they are clear
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I am following
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Very clear thank you
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes i believe we may
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

8/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 77 341 0203: In my understanding of the first video we are introduced to the Edoofa Co-Founders and the video generally focuses on the most important aspects and qualities required from Edoofians ,these being an open minded individual and be very teachable.The other major point is having Decipline especially with following the Edoofa instructions as this will make the process very quick and as enjoyable as possible.

The Co-Founders also showcase the Edoofa Scholarship wall of Fame 
And confirm that all the students/Edoofians involved are very happy,smiling and leading their dream lives.

The second video defines in detail the traits that distinguishes the successful students from the rest of the Crowd.The importance of making employable and relyable students and how Edoofa  contributes to this.The SEELS program is also mentioned and explained.

The third video mainly focuses on the Educational Institutions involved/working with Edoofa,about 250 schools if i am not mistaken.It also highlights how trustworthy and quick Edoofa is as compared to other Programs,which also take long.A short story about a student who wished to travel to China and payed a different agency an excessive amount of money   and was dissapointed.

The forth and final Video focuses preparing to interact in sessions with Schools.The video touches on the Statement of Purpose (SOP).It explains why the SOP is very important and that it is the most important step to secure a good scholarship.
8/1/24, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, I am highly impressed with your insights. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
8/1/24, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
8/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much for the additional insight on the videos.
I definitely agree with all these further explanations of the videos and I was able to understand most of the information from viewing the videos
8/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
8/1/24, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes we are 
We may safely proceed
8/1/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
8/1/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
8/1/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
8/1/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

8/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 77 341 0203: I am confident I will be able to complete these tasks in the next  two hours <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
8/1/24, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
8/1/24, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
8/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 77 341 0203: The current 12:30pm to 08:30pm time frame is manageable and works fine for me thank you
8/1/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much,I look forward to our next session
8/1/24, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear!
8/1/24, 7:14 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Thank you for a wonderful session
8/1/24, 7:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome @263773634425
9/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Good Morning
9/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 341 0203: 2.Rights and duties are integral components of social contracts that govern individual and societal behavior. Rights refer to entitlements and freedoms individuals possess, safeguarded by laws and societal norms. These can include fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and expression, or specific civil rights granted by a governing body, like the right to vote or a fair trial.

Duties, on the other hand, represent obligations individuals have towards society. They involve responsibilities to uphold laws, contribute to the common good, and respect the rights of others. While rights empower individuals, duties ensure a balance in societal interactions, fostering harmony and order.

In the context of Human Rights and Civil Rights, the distinction lies in their scope. Human Rights are universal entitlements inherent to all individuals by virtue of their humanity. These encompass broad principles like dignity and equality. On the contrary, Civil Rights are specific legal protections granted by a particular governing entity within its jurisdiction. They often address issues of citizenship, participation in governance, and protection against discrimination.

In summary, while rights grant freedoms, duties prescribe responsibilities, and within the realm of rights, the distinction between Human and Civil Rights lies in their universal versus jurisdiction-specific nature.

3.The terms "prosecutor" and "attorney" are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct roles within the legal system. A prosecutor is a government attorney responsible for presenting the case against an accused party in a criminal trial. They work on behalf of the government, aiming to prove the defendant's guilt and secure a conviction. Prosecutors represent the state or federal government and operate within the criminal justice system.

On the other hand, an attorney, or lawyer, is a broad term encompassing various legal professionals who provide legal advice and representation. Attorneys can specialize in different areas of law, including criminal defense, civil litigation, family law, and more. Defense attorneys, for instance, represent individuals accused of crimes and work to ensure their legal rights are protected.

In essence, all prosecutors are attorneys, but not all attorneys are prosecutors. Attorneys have diverse roles, representing clients in various legal matters, while prosecutors specifically focus on criminal cases on behalf of the government.

4.I am deeply drawn to the realm of Civil Law due to its profound impact on individuals' lives and the broader community. Civil Law provides a framework for resolving disputes, upholding rights, and ensuring justice in diverse areas such as contracts, property, and personal injury. My interest stems from the dynamic nature of civil cases, where the application of legal principles directly influences the lives of individuals.

In the Civil Law domain, I am captivated by the opportunity to navigate intricate legal nuances, negotiate settlements, and advocate for clients seeking resolution. The prospect of contributing to the fair dispensation of justice, particularly in matters involving individuals' rights and responsibilities, fuels my passion for this branch of law.

Moreover, the preventive aspect of Civil Law, focusing on contractual agreements and property rights, aligns with my inclination towards proactive legal practices. I am eager to engage in a field where legal expertise plays a pivotal role in averting disputes and safeguarding the interests of individuals and entities.

In essence, my profound interest in Civil Law arises from its ability to address real-world challenges, promote fairness, and offer a platform for constructive legal engagement in the pursuit of justice and resolution.

5.My proficiency in legal research is a cornerstone of my potential success as a lawyer. Through meticulous investigation and analysis, I have adeptly navigated complex legal issues. For instance, my ability to uncover relevant statutes and precedents significantly could contribute to building a compelling legal argument.

Another critical skill is my capacity for persuasive legal writing and oral advocacy. In a school project competition, I crafted a persuasive brief and effectively presented legal arguments before a couple of my school teachers. This experience not only honed my written and oral communication skills but also showcased my ability to construct a compelling narrative to support legal positions.

These skills, complemented by a keen understanding of ethical considerations and a dedication to the pursuit of justice, position me to excel as a lawyer. I am confident that my research acumen, coupled with persuasive advocacy skills, will enable me to navigate the complexities of legal practice successfully.

9/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Good afternoon
9/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fumani, Wishing you a good day!
9/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
9/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much
9/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Apologies I may be able to send the letter of recommendation tomorrow 

The school notified that it has power problems and they may be resolved by the end of the day
9/1/24, 12:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Alright dear you can share the letter if recommendation with us tomorrow
9/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you will definitely do
9/1/24, 12:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
9/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes that is accurate
9/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
9/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
9/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
9/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
9/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Definitely not possible
9/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
9/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Good day everyone.
9/1/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263773634425, How are you doing today ?
9/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 363 4425: I know of the $350 enrollment fee which we paid soon after receiving the Edoofa scholarship acceptance letter.
9/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263773634425, I am sure you must be aware of Registration fees as well
9/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Sorry when should the money be paid.
9/1/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry about the registration fee. Let me provide some clarity on this matter.

You don't have to worry about paying the registration fee right now. Let me help you in understanding the process -  you'll receive multiple offers from different universities. Once you've made your final decision on which university to pursue your Higher Education, that's when we will proceed with your admission application, at that time you need to complete the registration payment.
9/1/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please rest assured that we are here to support you every step of the way, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free admission journey. If you have any more questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Your academic success is our top priority.
9/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much for the clarification on the matter.
9/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Noted
9/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
9/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I am following, thank you.
9/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes, am following
9/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
9/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
9/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Noted
9/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
9/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
9/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 363 4425: I am following
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted and following
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 77 363 4425: I understand
9/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted thank you
9/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 363 4425: I don't have questions on that
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

9/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Very Interesting
9/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Great news, thank you
9/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Truly
Thank you
9/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Well understood and thank you
9/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes understood thank you
9/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes, it does.
This is impressive
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes
Very interesting
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Following and it's clear
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Have been attentive and Following.
9/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 341 0203: I have none thank you
9/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 363 4425: I am following, no questions at the moment.
9/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes very excited

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

13/1/24, 8:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
13/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 77 363 4425: 1) The per annum tuition fee is $350

2) Accommodation fee is $0


3) Annual fee at MVN university after scholarship is $1600

4) Sports and Music fee is $125 ( payable once)

5) $575
13/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details, Let me correct you here that the Admission and Processing Fee is $1000. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
13/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Very much ,thank you
13/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes it is. This is wonderful news
13/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome ! As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
13/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600 .

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600 . I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
13/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes, this is clear
13/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted,thank you
13/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
13/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
13/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Have gone throught the above message,Thank you
13/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 77 363 4425: I have gone through the message and noted.
13/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600 , let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
13/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
13/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes ,very clear thank you
13/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes it is
13/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600 . As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600 , which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
13/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes ,understood thank you
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 363 4425: I do understand, thank you
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
13/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
13/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Clear thank you
13/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes you are
13/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 26th, 2024*.
13/1/24, 9:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
13/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 363 4425: Yes, please do
13/1/24, 9:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 26th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 26th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
13/1/24, 9:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 26th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
13/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes,noted thank you
13/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 363 4425: It's clear and we are in agreement
13/1/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
13/1/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
13/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 77 363 4425: No,in Bulawayo
13/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
13/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.

13/1/24, 9:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
13/1/24, 9:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
13/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 363 4425: No , l think we would use  Mr Rajan
