For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i am done
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i am
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: I understand
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Am i going to pay this registration fee while in Zimbabwe or when i am in India?
18/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 You will be paying the registration fees when you are Zimbabwe as the university will be reserving your seat for scholarship although this will be needed when you will receive your offer letter
18/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand that the registration fees will be needed at the time of your registration at the university. However, for Edoofian students, this will not be an additional cost, as the registration fees will be adjusted in your tuition fees upon your arrival in India. I hope this clarifies your doubt ?
18/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am now i get it
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry ma'am i am lost a bit like the registration will be covered by the scholarship and then when i arrive i should cover it ,is that so
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, The scholarship covers your total cost of education which also includes your Registration fees, although you know the student who have applied for the admission at the university with Edoofa Scholarship they have to pay the registration fees and the complete tuition fees which means for them the registration fees is an additional cost. Please don't worry as we will have a detailed discussion about the same in our upcoming session
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am so we can proceed
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
19/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok.Students must be open minded and teachable which means they should follow all the instructions from Edoofa.Edoofa forcused on increasing students capacity for success, however  it is making quality education affordable.In choice of universities as Edoofa took more than a decade of years to identify good schools so Students must follow instructions to be qualified for prestigious institutions.
19/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 697 8729: As for the last one i did not understand
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes now i get it but can i know how this SOP works
19/1/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries please, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes please
19/1/24, 11:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/1/24, 10:22 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 5:19 AM - +263 78 697 8729: 2.Rights are those privileges and benefits a person enjoys as a citizen of a state while Duties are the responsibilities which citizens are expected to carry .To add on with an example of right to education where as it is a duty to educate 

Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being legal member of a certain political state .Civil rights are granted by the government while human rights are rights that are derived from natural law.In human rights we have the right to food while in civil rights we have to vote.

However ,Both human rihghts and civil rigths protect us against discrimination   ,injustice and inequality.They are  close linked for instance if you denied a fair trial by independent counsil some Human right you are also denied your right in many countries.

3.An Attorney is a lawyer who stand on behalf of others in legal matters especially those who are accused whereas a prosecutor is a lawyer who tries to prove in court that the person is guilty.

4.Criminal Lawyer ,because i want to advocate on behalf of those accused of criminal activity and ensures that their liberties and basic rights are fairly upheld with the justice system.To add on,  i like criminal law because i want to be in court mostly and my save my family in legal matters.

I think i am through
20/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Liberty, Wishing you a good day!

Thank you for sharing your response with us regarding the SOP form and academic questions. I have taken a note of them and will update them in our data. In order to move ahead with your journey, May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion ahead ?
20/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am we can proceed
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am i think by the end of this month i am going to complete
20/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
20/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 697 8729: You are welcome and thank you as well
20/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes you are right
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Whait if they find me ineligible for the course i applied for
20/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Please don't worry as you have been this course because you are eligible for the same.
20/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/1/24, 10:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 10:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok noted
20/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am
20/1/24, 10:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i am following ma'am
20/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
20/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry as the registration fee need to be paid within two weeks ,as an Edoofian i am suppose to pay it when?
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 The deadline date for the registration fees will be shared with you when you will receive your offer letter from the university officials. I hope you understand ?
20/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i understand
20/1/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok sorry Ms Ashi i think i am lost somewhere
20/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Please go ahead if you have any doubt
20/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 697 8729: The example you gave me is it after the scholarship?
20/1/24, 11:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, The tuition fees range shared with you which is $1200 to $1800 per year from $6000 to $8000 per year. The reduce in the amount is after scholarship, I am sure your counselor must have explained this as well, right ?
20/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes she explained but i want to know is that the registration fee is not going to be covered by Edoofa?
20/1/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 The registration fees are paid by the students only as the university will reserve your scholarship seat. However, For the edoofians, this registration fee is zero as once they paid the registration fees, the amount will be adjusted in their tuition fees. 

For a better understanding, If the registration fee is $1000 and the cost of education is $1650. Ideally, The student has to pay the amount of $2650. However, as you can edoofian you have an advantage here. I hope that's clear now.
20/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok so which means as Edoofians we are not going to pay the registration until we arrive on India?
20/1/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you here that the registration fees will be paid while you are in your country as you need to reserve your seat for the scholarship. Once you will complete the registration procedure, the amount you have paid will be shifted to your first year tuition fees.
20/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am i get i better so when do the offer letters will be out ,like the estimate dates
20/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 I will address this question with you soon at the end of our discussion. For now, can we continue with our discussion?
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am yes we can
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok noted please
20/1/24, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No we can proceed
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

20/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

20/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am this is the most exciting part we i would like to hear
20/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Liberty. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 697 8729: We are together
20/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
20/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No ma'am i want to know it
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am but i know it is going to be hard for my family as they earn money in early April but we are going try to complete it
20/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are putting your 100% efforts here for your education. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No i get it clear
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
