16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Comfort,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level / 12th grade  results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level / 12th grade results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $150 for your university registration fee is due by 30th of January, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $150 by now?
22/1/24, 7:55 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Evening Ashi, thank you for the inquiry. As indicated before, bank documents will be submitted by 29th since salaries will be credited by Friday. So don't worry. 

However I am still waiting for the invoice of $150, which you promised to send. 

Good night
