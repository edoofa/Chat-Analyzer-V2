20/12/23, 1:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet

27/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:35 PM - +260 779684925: Well understood
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 2:55 PM - +260 779684925: Clear we may proceed
27/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
27/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
27/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +260 779684925: A question
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +260 779684925: This process takes place after results are released right
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +260 779684925: Apart from that flyes we are following
27/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that you will receive the offer letter before the results are out dear
27/12/23, 3:04 PM - +260 779684925: Ohh okay we can proceed
27/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
27/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
27/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 3:11 PM - +260 779684925: Wow very interesting
27/12/23, 3:11 PM - +260 779684925: Well understood
27/12/23, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - +260 779684925: Yes please go ahead
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

27/12/23, 3:22 PM - +260 779684925: You may proceed

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
27/12/23, 3:59 PM - +260 779684925: I'm following
27/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know by when you will be able to go through the videos?
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 779684925: I just finished with them
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 4:17 PM - +260 779684925: Successful edoofians actually earn scholarship, Edoofa collects results sends them to universities and secures you a seat after payments are and also assist in the visa process.Edoofa EWYL program has helped many students by reducing on expenses
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 4:34 PM - +260 779684925: I agree
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - +260 779684925: Very much on the same page
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

This produces a higher dynamic pressure which will be of damaged to the pipelines due to its frequency.

28/12/23, 5:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 5:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 5:44 PM - +260 96 4841330: Very true
28/12/23, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 5:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - +260 96 7889730: Prefect that’s a long awaited session
28/12/23, 6:08 PM - +260 779684925: Yes he did
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 6:14 PM - +260 779684925: Very much on the same page
28/12/23, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 6:16 PM - +260 779684925: Yes I have
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 6:22 PM - +260 779684925: Okay this is interesting
28/12/23, 6:23 PM - +260 779684925: From here we may proceed from here
28/12/23, 6:25 PM - +260 96 7889730: Noted
28/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 6:29 PM - +260 96 7889730: You demand payment before acceptance into university and before results are out
28/12/23, 6:30 PM - +260 779684925: This is interesting
28/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260967889730, You will be required to pay the registration fees once you receive your offer letter please.
28/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 6:30 PM - +260 96 7889730: Thank you
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - +260 779684925: Payment are made after receiving an offer from the university right?
28/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @260779684925
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - +260 779684925: Okay then we can proceed
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - +260 779684925: This is very inspiring I look forward to becoming a proud Edoofian
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
28/12/23, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

29/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)

29/12/23, 3:35 PM - +260 96 4841330: Thank you so much
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - +260 779684925: We may proceed
29/12/23, 3:48 PM - +260 779684925: Hello administration officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL mentor. The name of the mentor is Ms.saloni and she has scheduled my session for the 5th January 2024
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - +260 779684925: Wow this is interesting very much encouraging
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:02 PM - +260 96 4841330: Okey meaning once the O-levels results are released,our responses to academic interview questions and statement of purpose will be the main keys for applying for a scholarship?
29/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260964841330
29/12/23, 4:04 PM - +260 779684925: Yes Ma'am
29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 779684925: Yes it does
29/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 4841330: Thank u
29/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 4:14 PM - +260 779684925: No questions ❓
29/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/12/23, 4:16 PM - +260 779684925: Please goahead in providing more information
29/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - +260 779684925: Yes clear
29/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
29/12/23, 4:21 PM - +260 779684925: Yes, right
29/12/23, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +260 779684925: Ohh okay
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - +260 96 4841330: This sounds good
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
29/12/23, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/12/23, 4:33 PM - +260 96 4841330: Understood thanks
29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
29/12/23, 4:55 PM - +260 96 4841330: Following
29/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +260 96 4841330: In this case what will happen to students without A-levels but have done well at Grade 12?are they going to be qualified to a 50/ scholarship?
29/12/23, 5:00 PM - +260 96 4841330: And what do you mean by E grades?
29/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the A level means grade 12 please, all the benefits are for 12th grade students please
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - +260 96 4841330: This sounds good
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - +260 96 4841330: Okey thanks for the clarification

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

15/1/24, 8:30 PM - +260 96 4841330: Thanks
16/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zhylani,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/1/24, 1:15 PM - +260 96 7889730: Thank you so very much
16/1/24, 1:15 PM - +260 96 7889730: I have concerns about the fees what’s is total cost of the program with scholarship
16/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:16 PM - +260 779684925: Very much looking forward to it
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - +260 779684925: 1)$1225
2)$1200
2)$750
16/1/24, 1:22 PM - +260 779684925: Is that so
16/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
16/1/24, 1:25 PM - +260 779684925: That's interesting
16/1/24, 1:25 PM - +260 779684925: So are the meals included in the hostel fee
16/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, The food cost is included in this fees. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
16/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
16/1/24, 1:28 PM - +260 779684925: Yessir
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
16/1/24, 1:39 PM - +260 779684925: Yes we are
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +260 779684925: Yes it is
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of Zhylani's annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how Zhylani can effectively make the education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - +260 779684925: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
16/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after Zhylani arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $838 and $837, with a six-month gap between them.
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +260 779684925: Ohh wow
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
16/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 779684925: Yes we have
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +260 779684925: Yes we are
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +260 779684925: Payment will surely be mad
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/1/24, 2:24 PM - +260 779684925: Yes please
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 29th, 2024.* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +260 779684925: Yes we are
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/1/24, 2:31 PM - +260 779684925: We live in Zambia, Northwestern province
16/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 2:37 PM - +260 96 4841330: Oh thanks to you Ash our admission officer God bless you
16/1/24, 2:37 PM - +260 96 4841330: Thank you so much we are ready to hear more
16/1/24, 2:38 PM - +260 96 4841330: Well noted thanks
16/1/24, 2:39 PM - +260 779684925: We sure will connect to him
16/1/24, 2:43 PM - +260 96 4841330: Interesting
16/1/24, 2:50 PM - +260 96 4841330: Amazing meaning four people can share one room
16/1/24, 2:50 PM - +260 96 4841330: Sure everything is clear
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - +260 96 4841330: Yes we are clear and health facilities are they also included in the university fee
16/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
16/1/24, 3:00 PM - +260 96 4841330: Is the 800 - 1200 guaranteed at the end of the year as the students EWYL ,we want to make plans as we prepare so that we do not find ourselves in unplanned situations

16/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have been observing that you have been sharing your response for my earlier messages. I would like to suggest that you can go through the above messages first and once you are done you can let me know so that we are on the same page, I hope that's alright ?

16/1/24, 3:20 PM - +260 96 4841330: Or does it mean when the child earns a $1000 towards the university fee the remaining tuition fee will also be share by both the parent and the university since she’s under their scholarship??

19/1/24, 10:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Zhylani !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Gulzar Group of Institutes. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutesas a collective?
19/1/24, 10:18 AM - +260 96 4841330: Goodmorning thanks mr Ashi
19/1/24, 10:19 AM - +260 96 7889730: Good morning to you
19/1/24, 10:21 AM - +260 96 4841330: Yes we did
19/1/24, 10:25 AM - +260 96 4841330: Is it possible that she can be offered another offer letter from another university/college? Or we just start preparing for Gulzar? I have asked this because In our previous discussions you talked about a situation where a student is accepted by two universities/college  which gives a student an opportunity to choose where she wants go
19/1/24, 10:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
19/1/24, 10:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
19/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/1/24, 10:53 AM - +260 96 4841330: Very very clear thanks
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - +260 779684925: Yes we are
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - +260 779684925: No I just found out
19/1/24, 11:04 AM - +260 96 7889730: We value the acceptance given and the question raised was merely a concern and not refusal
19/1/24, 11:08 AM - +260 779684925: We will settle with the current university,To avoid missing opportunitys
19/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please.  Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/1/24, 11:20 AM - +260 96 4841330: Very clear
19/1/24, 11:21 AM - +260 96 7889730: Very eloquent and content clearly
19/1/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear. I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/1/24, 11:34 AM - +260 779684925: I  am positive about going to Gulzar group of institutes and are settled with the opportunity
19/1/24, 11:36 AM - +260 96 7889730: We are following up the conversation with easy
19/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/1/24, 11:39 AM - +260 96 7889730: No further concerns you can proceed
19/1/24, 11:40 AM - +260 779684925: No queries we may proceed
19/1/24, 11:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
19/1/24, 11:44 AM - +260 779684925: Yes I did though not full information I'm sure you may add up as well
19/1/24, 11:45 AM - +260 96 4841330: Yes we did
19/1/24, 11:48 AM - +260 96 4841330: And before we proceed one more question please🙏
19/1/24, 11:52 AM - +260 96 4841330: Among  the universities you sent the applications to was National Institute of Technology Rourkela there? If it was not it’s fine since we have even settled for Gulzar
19/1/24, 11:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let me share that the National Institute of Technology Rourkela is the government college and in order to get the admission here the student needs to give the entrance exam hence we have not submitted the application at the same college please.
19/1/24, 11:56 AM - +260 96 7889730: How do you rate National institute of Technology Rourkela amongst other universities in India
19/1/24, 11:57 AM - +260 96 7889730: Thank you for the information
