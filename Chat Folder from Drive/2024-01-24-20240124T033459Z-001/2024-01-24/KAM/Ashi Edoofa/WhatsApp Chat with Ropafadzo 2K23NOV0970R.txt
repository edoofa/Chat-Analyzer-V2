It's nice that we received this offer letter from you, thank you very much the admission team. 
Ropafadzo highlighted to me that she still has some concerns on the program!
22/1/24, 10:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27745133207, May I know what Ropafadzo has highlighted to you ?
22/1/24, 10:25 AM - +27 74 513 3207: She told me that she said it before that the program offered (BA in Geography) is not the program that she applied for. She said she applied for Mining Engineering.
22/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Hello everyone,
22/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 71 287 7089: The program BA in geography I am not really interested in it and I am not sure about what is it all about.
22/1/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your thoughts here, However I believe we already had a discussion about the same right ?
22/1/24, 10:53 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Yes I think so
22/1/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, I remember that you were comfortable with BA in Geography that time, right ?
22/1/24, 10:59 AM - +27 74 513 3207: No
22/1/24, 11:02 AM - +27 74 513 3207: Ropafadzo highlighted about this long before and there is no clear answer up to now
22/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 74 513 3207: If I remember very well it was said that when searching for universities, that's when this issue was supposed to be rectified
22/1/24, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please go through this message
22/1/24, 11:35 AM - +27 74 513 3207: I think we have got a challenge here. On this message you clearly highlighted that you don't have Mining Engineering program available. The problem now is Ropafadzo is insisting that she needs Mining Engineering and not BA in Geography. So I don't know now how this can be resolved.

Me as a parent I can not force her into something that she is not comfortable with.
22/1/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate that you have shared this with us, I understand and respect Ropafadzo interest. Let me share that the course we have offered for her is based on her interest and career goals. I would like to connect with her to understand her point of view. May I know if she is available ?
22/1/24, 11:47 AM - +27 74 513 3207: At the moment she is not available. Let me check on her and will let you know.
22/1/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27745133207
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Hello ,good morning officers.!
23/1/24, 11:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Ropafadzo, How are you doing today ?
23/1/24, 11:09 AM - +263 71 287 7089: I am doing good thank you
23/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that dear, In regards to our last conversation I believe there was some confusion regarding your course right ?
23/1/24, 11:16 AM - +263 71 287 7089: Yes
23/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Would you help me understand what is the confusion here ?
23/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 71 287 7089: The program (BA in geography) am not really interested in it and I don't know about it very well.
According to my searches it is an old program and I don't think would suite my career desire.
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 287 7089: This issue was discussed before and it was said it's possible to change it but here ,the admission team said it can't be changed so am confused .
So if the program I want is not readily available I think we can find some solution otherwise.
23/1/24, 11:38 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, May I kindly know which course you want to pursue at the moment considering that Mining Engineering is not available ?
23/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 71 287 7089: I wanted mining engineering abroad so if it's not available I prefer studying other courses here in Zimbabwe.
