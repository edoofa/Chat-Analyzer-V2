I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:36 PM - +260 97 6560282: Good Afternoon...... So the A_level results have not yet been released, we are still waiting for them to come.... I am sure by month end they will be out and we will share them with you.
16/1/24, 2:41 PM - +260 97 6560282: Oh sorry for that... Let me clarify with you that what we are expecting are O_levels results and not A_levels
16/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 97 6560282: I sat for O_levels Examinations
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - +260 97 7715885: If l can jump in, yes Lushomo just finished Secondary school, Grade 12. So the examination she sat for is called Grade 12 Secondary School Ordinary Level and not A Level. So she is waiting for her Results that should come out within the next obevto three months time.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries please, You can skip the above messages. As you mentioned that you will receive the O level at the end of month. Kindly make sure to share the results with us once you have received them
16/1/24, 3:16 PM - +260 97 6560282: Noted
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - Look Good and Feel Good: If I can also ask, am concerned.  You didn't confirm receipt of the balance I sent for Lushomo's registration. Please kindly confirm and acknowledge if all is well, thank you.
16/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260977117478 Please don't worry as it had been duly noted with us
22/1/24, 6:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Lushomo ,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $9 for your university registration fee is due. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $9 by now?
22/1/24, 10:25 PM - Look Good and Feel Good: Greeting, last time I was told that the balance for registration was USD33 and I sent that in December. I am not sure where that USD 9 is coming from.
23/1/24, 7:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lushomo, I hope you are doing well.
23/1/24, 7:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your query here let me help you understand when you make the payment in Zambia there are transfer charges which are also included. Yesterday when I was checking your application dear, I found that you have a pending $9 for your registration.
23/1/24, 7:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I shared the above message with you.
23/1/24, 8:55 AM - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay thanks, I'll deposit it tomorrow.
23/1/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @260977117478, I will be looking forward to the receipt
