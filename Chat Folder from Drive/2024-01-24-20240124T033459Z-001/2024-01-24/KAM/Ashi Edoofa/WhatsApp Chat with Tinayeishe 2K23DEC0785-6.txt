Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

6/1/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 10:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 10:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 790 1774: 1.$350
2.$0.00
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
6/1/24, 10:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes it is affordable
6/1/24, 10:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 10:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am so this time i should pay $1850
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263787901774, If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Are there any other costs besides ticket fee and visa fee
6/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am understood
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, These are the only cost which will be needed.
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Clear
6/1/24, 11:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am understood but I have a question
6/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please go ahead dear
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 790 1774: My mother had from her relatives that they their friends n relatives had a problem with Edoofa on the issue of EWYL. They said that they were not given the credits but only certificates and were forced to pay the whole amount without using their scholarship credits otherwise they will not go school? So l wanted to know on which circumstances will this happen?
6/1/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with us, I will be more than happy to assit you. However, we will assist this query at the end of our session so that we can first complete the letter discussion properly, I hope that's fine ?
6/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850 . Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes clear ma'am
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 19th, 2024*.
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th 2024, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Understood
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 790 1774: No in Nyanga or
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's Eco Cash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
6/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Understood
6/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay understood but you haven't answered my first question
6/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Let me assist your query regarding the EWYL, Could you please let me understand what is your query please ?
6/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay My mother had from her relatives that they their friends n relatives had a problem with Edoofa on the issue of EWYL. They said that they were not given the credits but only certificates and were forced to pay the whole amount without using their scholarship credits otherwise they will not go school?

6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263787901774, In order to verify this concern could you please share the name of the students who have shared this concern with you ?
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 790 1774: I don't know the names

6/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am

9/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Hello ma'am how are you doing today
9/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Good afternoon ma'am
9/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am doing well dear, thank you. May I know if you have discuss the offer letter as a family ?
9/1/24, 6:27 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes we discussed the letter ma'am
9/1/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
9/1/24, 7:53 PM - +263 78 790 1774: They're very happy and delighted
9/1/24, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
9/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay they said that are there any offer letters because you once told us that us you may choose on variety universities
9/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 78 790 1774: And also they wanted to know the cut off points for this program
9/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
9/1/24, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
9/1/24, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
9/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am thank you
9/1/24, 9:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN , you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN  and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 78 790 1774: No ma'am
9/1/24, 9:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN  by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
9/1/24, 9:39 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Understood
9/1/24, 9:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000 .

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
9/1/24, 9:45 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Clear ma'am
9/1/24, 9:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
9/1/24, 9:49 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes l did
9/1/24, 9:50 PM - +263 78 790 1774: So wanted to ask if people at MVN university are vegetarians?
9/1/24, 9:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Let me share that the people are at MVN University are both Vegetarian and Non- Vegetarian <This message was edited>

As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

19/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am afraid to share that the information you have received is not accurate dear. The student who have enrolled themselves in the Law for their Education with the Edoofa Scholarship Program are doing well in their career currently. Hence, In order me to help you here, I wan to understand what information you have received from the Council of law and law society in Harare, Zimbabwe
19/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 790 1774: They said the type of Law you gave me is not recognized in Zimbabwe and l cannot work here in Zimbawe l will have to go to university after my studies here in Zimb again for abt 3-4 yrs of which it is a lot

This is what they said….they said with the law i will have to do more years in Zimbabwe if l want to practice my Law in Zimbabwe
19/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Is this the only Law you offer in India ?
19/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for well elaborate message dear, I have understood your query. I understand your interest in the field of law, and I would like to provide you with some insights that will help you gain a better understanding of the legal system. 

It's important to note that the legal system varies from one country to another. Many individuals from Zimbabwe have pursued a law degree and established successful careers in the field.

The law program you are enrolled in covers general subjects under law, not specific to Indian laws. To practice law in any country, including India and Zimbabwe, one must pass the BAR exam. Were you aware of the same?
19/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Not ma’am
19/1/24, 9:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear. Let me share some insights with you here. The BAR exam is a rigorous and comprehensive assessment that individuals must pass in order to become licensed to practice law in a specific jurisdiction. It is a crucial step for anyone aspiring to pursue a career as a lawyer.

19/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 790 1774: We were at our village and we failed to meet the dates because we also wanted to clarify some queries at our offices of Law in Zimbabwe….So we had to wait after the funeral and go to Harare whichi is quite a long distance so we couldn’t meet the date .Sorry for that
19/1/24, 10:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, As I can understand that you want to share your queries at your office in Zimbabwe which is truly fine and appreciated. However, I am a bit afraid as you will lose this crucial opportunity provided by the MVN University. Considering that you are looking for another university, I want to mention that we have already submitted your application to another university, and we are waiting for their response.

Although, Considering the amount of scholarship offered by the MVN University, I would like to emphasize that this amount of scholarship is not likely to be matched by other universities. Being your admission officer, I don't want you to loose on this scholarship offer, especially since you have already cleared the eligible passes required for Law at MVN University.
19/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Im sorry sir please just help me find another one and im sure l won’t miss the dates
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that in order to do Law there are multiple eligible passes required. For example - If a student want to do Law in Zimbabwe , the student need to requires a score of 15 points in A level, which is a challenging task. Therefore, I suggest you to consider the benefits of staying at MVN University and taking advantage of the scholarship offer.

While I understand that you are not in your area due to which you will not be able to complete the registration process. I am here to help you in the same matter. But you need to first share your thoughts with us, right ?
19/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yea l know and in Zimbabwe they are also giving Law to those with 14 or 13 but on other universities which is not UZ
19/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 790 1774: But l want to fulfill my dream to study abroad that is why im looking for the best
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, I can truly see the passion in your commitment which is why I don't want you to loose this opportunity. If you need any help I am here for you.
19/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Thank you ma’am

19/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Can you please help me find another university which is best
19/1/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Before I answer that query I want to understand why you don't want to continue with MVN University dear. Could you please let me know ?
19/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Ma’am can you please share the ranking of universities in India
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787901774 I would love to share the ranking of the university. However, My above questions is not answered yet
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 78 790 1774: When l searched it l discovered that it is not ranked as the best because it is not even in the top 400 of universities according to google
19/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am afraid that this is not correct. You know when we do some research on the internet there is a high probability that you are not receiving the right information which is why we recommend our student to do their research on the trusted website. 

Moreover, MVN University is the good university, It is recognized as one of the leading university in India and from past few years, It has consistently stood out among rest of the university. 

The university does not only focuses on the affordability and insures that the student are able to get the higher quantum of scholarship but it also has certain facilities that ensures that the student to faculty ratio is the lowest and the personalized attention are given to the students and it is one of the university that focuses on the holistic development. However it seems like you are concerned about that the same university  if it is the right fit for you. On this note, May I know what exactly is the concern you have so that I can assist you in the better way?
