I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

17/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 23. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program.

17/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you tried to access the form with stable internet connection? If yes, may I suggest that you try to access the form through a different device?
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 442 9614: I have just discovered that the internet connection is not good today.
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you let me know by when you will be able to submit the form?
20/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 269 7128: By Monday.
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I will look forward to getting an update on the same from you on Monday. In the meanwhile, before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how you and your family are doing today?
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 627 4716: We are doing well? How are you
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am doing well myself, thank you for asking. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 442 9614: We are ready.
20/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 442 9614: Clear.
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
20/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 442 9614: Yes.
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Clear.Thanks.
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Yes
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 627 4716: The documents above are Manyonganise Komborero's 2023 ZIMSEC ZGCE Advanced Level Examinations statement of entry, 2023 ZIMSEC ZGCE Advanced Level Examinations results and School Authorities' Letter of recommendation.
20/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Yes.
20/1/24, 3:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your message, dear. However, I am assuming due to some network issues, I have not yet received the documents in the chat. Could you be kind enough to resend the same?
