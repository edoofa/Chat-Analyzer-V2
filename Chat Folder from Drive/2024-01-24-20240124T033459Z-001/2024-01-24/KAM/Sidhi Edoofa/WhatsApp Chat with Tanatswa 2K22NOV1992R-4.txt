This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

6/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Thank you so much Mr Shivjeet for your services.It has been really great working with you.

I wish you the best on your new journey.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Hello Ms Siddhi Singh.l am happy to be on this journey with .

We started 2024 on a good note
8/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Tanatswa.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I have decided to claim 2024 as my year making progress in life bringing the most out of me in this new year l will only be chasing my dreams and of course learning new skills
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear. With learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Sorry ma'am if l may ask what formalities
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's alright, Tanatswa. Let me help you recall.

The last time we were in contact, we successfully completed some aspects of your admission process, including initial formalities such as the Feedback Form, Student Application Form, and preparation of your Statement of Purpose (SOP). However, to progress further in the process and assist you in securing a scholarship seat with the best university for your education, we were supposed to help you obtain your scholarship offer letter to complete university registration formalities. Unfortunately, this was left incomplete, possibly due to your preoccupation with exams. Do you recall the procedures we underwent during that time?
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes l remember l did send my statement of purpose and l was told to wait for 3 to 4 days l am not sure and l will receive an e-mail from the college
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 328 7663: If l still remember well that was 2022 when l sent it and  when l inquired about not receiving any e-mail from the college they said we will continue with the college admission process next year meaning 2023.
So since then l have been waiting.
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. That was the last stage that was covered. However, after consulting with Mr. Shivjeet he brought to my attention that you had certain concerns with going forward with your application, and that is the reason why you were unable to proceed to the next stage. May I know more about it? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also Tanatswa, I would like to ask you to help me understand with your 2nd message better? Which college did you email?
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I wanted to change my program
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I did not e-mail any college rather l was told that a college wilk e-mail me after l sent my SOP I'm sure that is also when l sent a task l was given they were few questions l was supposed to answer
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. I would like to discuss the same in a detailed conversation tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow?
8/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes Ms Siddhi
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright Tanatswa. I will connect with you tomorrow. Till then, take care and have a good night!
8/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Same with you ma'am
9/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa. How are you today?
9/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Good morning Ms Siddhi how are you doing
9/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking, dear. With respect to our previous conversation, you had raised a concern regarding changing your program. May I know what is your concern exactly?
9/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 77 328 7663: I was saying l wanted to change the program computer science to BBA IT but we resolved the issue with Mr Shivjeet
9/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. I am glad to hear that it was resolved. May I know what was the conclusion of that discussion? Because as per my records, the conversation was incomplete, due to which we were unable to proceed with your university application process.
9/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 328 7663: We just concluded that l will continue with computer science
9/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Nothing else was said
9/1/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Okay. May I know if your final decision is to continue with Computer Science?
9/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes its computer science
9/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright then, Tanatswa. Do you wish to move ahead with your application process now? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes you can highlight on the costs
9/1/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
9/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok ok yes so l get to choose any university of my choice
9/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. We will be sending out your application to 5 different universities, and based on their evaluation, in case you receive offer letters from more than one university, you will have the option to select the university of your choice.
9/1/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If this answers your query, do you wish to move forward with the application process?
9/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 328 7663: This is truly awesome l wish this team the best
9/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, dear. They are truly a talented and intellectual group of students. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
9/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 328 7663: And l appreciate your work <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, dear! With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
9/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I'm done
9/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 328 7663: You said the university will mention my schoolarship percentage is it fixed before seeing my results
9/1/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The scholarship percentage depends on various factors such as your SOP, your application, and your previous results. The scholarship is granted on the basis of these factors. In the event that your results are better than expected, the university might reevaluate your scholarship percentage, and if they deem it fitting, they will make changes to your scholarship program. Does that clarify your doubt?
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes thank you for the clarification
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome.
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes ma'am
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 328 7663: No
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok
9/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 328 7663: That's true
9/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
9/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
9/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok l understand
9/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 328 7663: No
9/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 4:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one

9/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing it with me, Tanatswa.
9/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter.

12/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 77 328 7663: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, parents and Tanatswa. How are you doing today?
16/1/24, 8:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with me. I would like to congratulate you on your performance, Tanatswa.
16/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 328 7663: Greetings Mr Siddhi.We are doing fine
Thank you so much .Sorry is it possible to change my program now if its possible l would like to change to Acturial Science.
17/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Tanatswa. I hope you are doing well today. May I know what has caused you to change your course to Acturial Science? I am only asking this to get a better understanding of your situation so I can provide assistance to the best of my ability.
17/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Before choosing computer science l wanted actuarial science and my chancellor said we do not offer that program so l decided to change to computer science so now that the results are out l asked one of the former student of my school if India does not offer actuarial science and she said they offer the program
That is why l want acturial science now
17/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Plus considering my results also
22/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa. I hope you all are doing well. I regret not being able to connect with you earlier. However, I am glad that we can reconnect now.
22/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Greetings
22/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a confusion Tanatswa. Allow me to help you understand it better. Actuarial science is not offered as a degree or program. To become an actuary in India, aspiring candidates typically start with a strong background in mathematics or statistics after completing their 10+2 education. They register with recognized actuarial organizations like the Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) or the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA). Choosing a specific track, candidates prepare for and appear in a series of rigorous actuarial exams. Alongside exam success, gaining practical work experience is often required. Completion of exams, professionalism courses, and fulfillment of work-based skills may lead to attaining Fellowship status, signifying full qualification as an actuary.
22/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Actuarial science is typically not offered as a standalone undergraduate degree at many universities. However, students interested in pursuing a career as an actuary can opt for related programs such as mathematics, statistics, finance, or economics. These programs provide a strong foundation in the quantitative and analytical skills essential for actuarial work. While studying these related subjects, students can concurrently prepare for actuarial exams offered by professional organizations, gaining the necessary knowledge to succeed in the field. Choosing a complementary program allows flexibility for students to build expertise in areas like risk management, financial modeling, and statistical analysis, preparing them comprehensively for a successful actuarial career.
22/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 328 7663: If its not a degree then its fine
22/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes Tanatswa. You have understood it correctly. May I know if this was helpful? If you have any more queries, kindly let me know so I can assist you with it. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tanatswa. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you and your family doing today?
23/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Greetings Ms Siddhi
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages and if that helped you with your query?
23/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes but l want acturial science if India can not offer me that then its ok l will apply here in Zimbabwe
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your interest in pursuing actuarial science. However, it's essential to note that even in Zimbabwe, the degrees offered are not strictly core actuarial science. Some universities do provide actuarial science as a degree, but they focus on subjects relevant to clearing actuary examinations rather than specialization. May I know who was your source that informed you about actuarial science being offered as a degree here in India?
23/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I asked a friend who is already in india
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Thank you for letting me know. If I may ask, what is their name and what are they pursuing here in India? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I'm sorry But l can not disclose her information
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you do not wish to disclose her information and I respect it. However, I want to highlight a concern of mine that you might be making a decision on the basis of misinformation. At Edoofa, we bring over 15 years of experience, collaborating with numerous students from Africa. Our extensive network includes partnerships with ministries, industries, and employers. The courses and universities we offer are carefully selected, ensuring you have the best options for your higher education. Enrolling in the Edoofa scholarship program reflects your commitment to making informed decisions, and we are here to provide guidance for a successful journey through your admission and university experience.
23/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, if you choose to make a rushed decision, you might lose out on a great opportunity of the educational and job opportunities that India has to offer in the field of actuarial sciences. 
India provides extensive opportunities in actuarial science, with a rising demand for skilled professionals across sectors like insurance and finance. Actuaries in India play vital roles in risk assessment, financial modeling, and strategic decision-making. Renowned insurance companies, financial institutions, and consulting firms actively seek qualified actuaries, making India an emerging hub for actuarial careers. Pursuing actuarial science in India provides a gateway to a dynamic and evolving field with diverse opportunities for professional growth and impact.
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with that, I would also like to share an example of the opportunities that are provided to you here at Edoofa. With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but during this event, we were fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who presented and shared their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they were there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students presented directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

23/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok l have heard what you said and I'm not making any decisions in rush l applied to a few best universities here in my country that offer actuarial science and l will have to decide after their response .
I am also concerned with the universities that you offer l am afraid l might get admitted to a school that is at the outskirts of the country and that won't be really good 
Also about computer science l have researched about requirements and it requires for one to have a pass in Physics and l dont know anything about physics
23/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263773287663, with all due respect, I understand what you are sharing, and I think there is some misunderstanding over here. No one has denied you from pursuing your interest of being an Actuary, rather as your admission officer I am trying my level best to ensure that as per your career aspiration you should have the best of the possibilities in life. 

You can pursue your certification of Actuarial Sciences along with any of the Bachelor degree. Correct me if I am wrong, it seems to me like you have some doubts about the legitimacy of the universities and courses offered by Edoofa. As your admission officer, I am personally available to help you with any doubts or queries that you have regarding your educational journey. Understanding you better will help me provide an appropriate solution for you, and unless we have open and transparent conversations, it cannot be achieved. I hope we are together in this?
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
23/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you agree Tanatswa. In that case, could you kindly help me understand what it is that is bothering you exactly?

Alternatively, I can also arrange for a call with the Program Director at Edoofa, and you may directly share your concerns with him so that he can address it and help you get a better understanding of the program and the universities we are associated with. Would you prefer that?
23/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 328 7663: No that's fine
23/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Do not arrange any call
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Tanatswa. May I know the reason because of which you do not wish to connect with the Program Director?
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 328 7663: You have explained everything to me
23/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. However, it seems to me that you still have certain doubts and queries regarding the courses and universities that we offer to the students. That is the reason why I asked you if you wish to schedule a call with the Program Director. However, you say that you do not wish a call to be arranged. I am a bit confused regarding the same. Could you kindly come forward and help me gain a better understanding of your perspective?
23/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes l am having a doubt in everything I'm  not even sure if l should continue with the program
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand your position Tanatswa. If I was in your position, I would also have doubts. My only intention is to help you out in gaining a better understanding of what Edoofa has to offer. If pursuing your higher education in Zimbabwe is the best option for you, I completely agree that you should go ahead with it. Kindly do not misunderstand the agenda of the call with the Program Director. This call is important so that you are able to clarify your doubts regarding Edoofa. Please understand that since you are a part of the Edoofa family, we are trying to provide you with information and guidance so that you are able to make the best decision for yourself. Be rest assured that no one is going to pressurize you into making a decision and that we are always going to be here whenever you need guidance, assistance and support. I hope you understand what I am trying to say?
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I understand you
23/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right @263773287663  , in that case, if we are of the same age, I would like to understand your thoughts in a better way. The reason you enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program was to help yourself get access to better opportunities in India, and since the past two years, this is the moment you and your family were waiting for. They were waiting for you to get your A Level results so that you can chart the way forward for your dreams of education abroad, and now that we have reached that stage, it seems as if you yourself have given up on everything we have worked for so far. Maybe that is the reason I am not able to understand you well, and I'm not sure what it is that you want us to do to help you with the way forward. Can you help me here?
23/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I already got my A level results and I'm sure l sent you the results
23/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I want acturial science thats why and here in my country it is offered as a degree on best institutions
23/1/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes Tanatswa, you did send your A-Level results. I understand that you wish to become an actuary scientist someday, and that is exactly what I am trying to help you with. This is the reason why I suggested you to have a call with our Program Director, because on a call you will be able to explain your concerns clearly and also be able to understand the solution that we are trying to provide you. Without having an open mind about our conversation, we will not be able to reach a desirable solution. I'm unsure about what you need us to do to assist you in moving forward. Can you help me understand the same?
23/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ms Siddhi l will get back to you after a discussion with.my family
23/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, @263773287663 . Discussing such matters with your family is very important, as this decision will be career defining. Making an informed decision is very crucial, and we are ready to offer all the guidance that you require for the same. I hope you have a fruitful conversation with your family Tanatswa. I wish you a blessed night and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
23/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok ma'am thank you so much for your time
23/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Tanatswa.
