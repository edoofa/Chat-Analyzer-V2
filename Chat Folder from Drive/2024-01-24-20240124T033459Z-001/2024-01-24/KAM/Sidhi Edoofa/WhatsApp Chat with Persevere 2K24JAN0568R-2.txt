I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 838 1040: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 838 1040: <Media omitted>

17/1/24, 10:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents, dear.
17/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
17/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I have gone it ,you can explain in detail
17/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I am clear with the two steps
17/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes i am following
17/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/1/24, 11:24 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Is the registration fee paid immediately or there is a duration date
17/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand your concern. As we move forward, I will provide you with more details in our future sessions which will help you understand the whole registration process better. In that case, shall we proceed with our session?
17/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we may proceed with our session
17/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/1/24, 11:47 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we may start with the first step of admission journey which is the Message from the founder's office
17/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted

19/1/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Persevere. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 366 7335: Good morning,  Ms.  Siddhi.We are fine todey.
19/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you all are doing fine, dear. Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. I have taken a note of it.
19/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to complete the 2nd task?
19/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 838 1040: 2) What are some causes of gas pipeline vibration 20 Carbon steel lines.
Answer:
When a gas gets to critical flow,sonic booms (producing vibration) is expected.Infact ,one of the main means by which the additional pressure in the pipe is lost.External factors such as wind can cause gas pipeline vibration by vortex shedding from the pipe surface which is a function of wind velocity and wind diameter.If problem exist ,the stiffness and the natural frequency of the piping should be increased by adding bracing ,consistent with still meeting piping  flexibility and associated equipment requirements .Seismic activity can also result in vibrations in steel nearby construction has the ability to cause vibrations .Improper installations or maintanance can also cause vibrations in steel.Earthquakes can cause piping vibrations either directly due to resonance or by the motion of pipe supports or equipment connections.Piping in areas known to experience earthquakesshould be checked for forces due to earthquakes. Acoustically induced vibration which occur in high capacity,gas flow ,pressure reducing systems.Pressure reduction can occur at control valves,at restriction orifices and safety valves.

3)When using a pumping loop to mix two miscible fluids in a tank ,when can the contents be considered well mixed
Answer:
A rule of thumb is to turn the tank over 3 times and then sample the tank for mixture properties.By " turn the tank over",we mean to force the entire volume of the tank through the pump at least 3 times.More turnover may be necessary, but 3 times is a good starting point.The contents may be considered well mixed when there are no visible differences in the fluid and when samples taken from different parts of the tank have the same mixture.

4)Are there any general rules for flushing slurry lines?
Answer:
Slurry lines should be flushed with a minimum fluid velocity of 10ft/s and the total flushing liquid volume should equal 3-6times the total piping volume.Another option is flushing the pipelines with water however,caution should be taken.Maintanance routines for flushing and a draining of pipelines must be done along with manual cleaning.Pnone wear points must be identified.Use a valve with maximum port size.Use long radius  bends.

5)What is pneumatic conveying
Answer:
Pneumatic is an efficient means of handling and transporting various types of bulk granular and powder products with minimum loss and at a lower cost than other systems.Pneumatic conveyors can be used for many types of products across a wide range of industries ,including chemicals ,food and beverages and much more. Pneumatic conveying systems use a series of pipeline that move products by pumping air .These products typically consist of powders and granules.These systems function by moving materials through enclosed airtight pipelines through a combination of airflow or another type of gas and pressure.Operators can control positive or negative pressure of airflow to smoothly transfer products without worrying about damage or loss.The are several advantages of pneumating conveying including: -pneumatic conveyors can run long distances either horizontally or vertically.
- these systems are easier to locate because they require less floor space.
There are also some disadvantages of using pneumatic conveying systems which include:- inability to be used with higher product volumes without some challenges as most pipeline measure from around 3 to 12 inches.
19/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I am doing fine today ,sorry for the delay my phone was having network issues.
19/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes i have completed the 2nd task
19/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing okay, dear. Thank you for sharing the answers with me. I have taken a note of it.
19/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you are available now to proceed with our session? <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we may proceed with the session
19/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 15 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I have paid an admission of $394
19/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. There has been a confusion from my end, for which I would like to apologize. You are indeed correct, and your enrollment payment has been duly noted by me.
19/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Chemical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes the information u have is true
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes it is impossible to study at multiple universities
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes my counselor haa discussed the registration fee during our counseling sessions
19/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we are on the same page
19/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page, Persevere. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
19/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Ok
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $2600 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $3600). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Well noted
19/1/24, 6:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you were able to follow the details, Persevere. As much as I would love to continue with our discussion, my operational hours for the day have already concluded. Hence, I would like to schedule our session for tomorrow at 10:00 AM so that we can move forward in your admission process and proceed to the step 4 of the admission cycle i.e., Offer Letter from University. May I know if the timing is suitable for you?
19/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes will be ready by 10:00AM
19/1/24, 6:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. In that case, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
19/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Same to you
20/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Persevere. May I know how you all are doing today?
20/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I am fine and how are you
20/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, Persevere. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking dear. May I know if you were able to follow all the details from our previous conversation? Kindly let me know if you have any queries or thoughts related to it.
20/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes i have gone through our previous conversation and would like to know if the registration fee is to be paid in full amounts within 2 weeks or can be paid in parts
20/1/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is a very valid query, Persevere. I am about to discuss the fee structure with you right now and in order to explain the payment plan to you, it is important that we discuss the fee structure in detail. Following today's discussion, you will have more clarity on the same. I would like to request you to be a little patient with me so that I can address all your queries during our discussion today. I hope we are together in this?
20/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we are together in this
20/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
20/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $1000 = $2600. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1300 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1300 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 838 1040: Noted
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 838 1040: I understand
20/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
20/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 838 1040: I dont have queries anymore
20/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
20/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 838 1040: I will be waiting to receive the offer letter so that i can accomplish my dream
20/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Persevere and I look forward to meeting you here in India along with other members of the Edoofa family. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
20/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes i am excited to know the news
20/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
20/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 838 1040: No i am not aware of the solution
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes i have followed the details and i hope my parents will be able to pay the registration fee
20/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that your parents must be preparing for the finances dear and that you will be able to start your education journey in a smooth manner. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 838 1040: No i dont have any queries of the admissiom process
20/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (19 January 2024).
