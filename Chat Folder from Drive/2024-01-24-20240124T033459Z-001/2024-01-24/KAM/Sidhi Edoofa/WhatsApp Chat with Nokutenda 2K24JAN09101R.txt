Starting from our sessions on 24 January, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on steps needed before 28 January. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on 30 January. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.
