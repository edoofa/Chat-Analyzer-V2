Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes they are already in the group.
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?

The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?

23/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Kundai 2K24JAN1047R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
23/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Kundai EWYL23E1200)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
23/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes I understand. Thank you
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
23/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 256 8023: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has impressed me in many ways. It takes great care of the edoofians and help them in understanding more about their  choice of career. It also makes education affordable to those who are economically challenged.
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you find the program to be so helpful in terms of support and self-financing your own education.
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we, as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
23/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 71 256 8023: The EWYL is also quite impressive as it helps a student to be more independent.
23/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes please
23/1/24, 5:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Great to hear that you've taken note of the second form as well. Now, moving on to the third and final form:

However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.

With this form that has been shared with you, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
23/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Ok, l understand
23/1/24, 5:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I had asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that as well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
23/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 71 256 8023: I will try to get it from school tomorrow
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Central African Time.
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
23/1/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)?
23/1/24, 5:59 PM - +263 71 256 8023: 4pm to 5pm
23/1/24, 5:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Saturday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
23/1/24, 6:00 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, thank you
23/1/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and share the documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
23/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you
