6/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 640 6835: Good day
Thank you
6/1/24, 6:06 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Thank you so much 
All the best in your endvours
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Caabilo,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Good day 
A happy New year to you too
9/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Good morning
I don't think they are any changes I have Decided to make , my goals are still the same, ohhh yes one thing I have decided to do is take my Debating and public speaking career to the next level
9/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 137 6751: I couldn't proceed back then because I wanted to focus on my school work and financial constraints , now the major problem I face currently is financial constraints due to some family emergencies which had to be attended to
9/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. May I ask, what exactly are the difficulties that you are currently facing?
9/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Financial constraints I understand that after being given an offer letter I have to pay about $700 to reserve my spot at the university
9/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. It ranges from $500 - $1000 depending on the university. Do you wish to be briefed about the same?
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes please
9/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

The registration amount ($750) has to be paid within 2 weeks of the date you receive your offer letter. Are you following? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
9/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates. Is this part clear? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Okay thank you
9/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Do you have any other queries or do you wish to continue with the application process now?
9/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 137 6751: No queries
No I can not proceed with the application process as I have highlighted before that currently financially my parents can not avail the registration fee
9/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that, dear. But I would like to highlight that the registration fee is *not an additional cost*, it is included in the fees of your first year of study.
9/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you must be preparing financially for your higher education?
9/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes I understand
9/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes but as I had highlighted before, a few emergencies came up
9/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that certain unfortunate emergencies may arise and cause financial inconvenience for us. Your concern is related to the payment of the registration fees, which is a part of your first year of study. If I may ask, how are you preparing for your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes the registration fee is my concern
Am trying to find ways to earn and save up for my tertiary education so that I don't strain my parents much as am not the only person whose fees they pay
9/1/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand, Caabilo. It is quite commendable that you are working hard to earn money yourself to sponsor your education. The Edoofa Scholarship Program operates on the same beliefs, providing you with opportunities to self-finance your higher education with the EWYL program. However, with the amount of work you are putting in, you must have some plans as to how you are going to proceed with your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Plans in terms of ?
9/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Plans in terms of pursuing your higher education, dear.
9/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Maybe we are missing each other at some point can you give an example maybe
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You mentioned that you wish to withdraw your application from the Edoofa scholarship program. I would like to understand what your plans for higher education will be.
9/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 71 137 6751: I do wish to withdraw my application I just want to put it on hold until mid February I think my parents would have had enough time to try gather the funds needed for the admission process
9/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 137 6751: If worst come to worst I might take a gap year
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that navigating a financial crisis is challenging, and it is entirely reasonable if you wish to put your application on hold until you have more financial stability. If I were in your position, I would likely consider the same approach. However, if you choose to put your application on hold, there is a specific procedure we follow for such instances. It's crucial to recognize that you have enrolled in a scholarship program that students strive to pursue on a global level, and you have successfully cleared the required processes. Your approach might have left a negative impact with the Academic Board. This program has a limited number of seats, with 69 students already securing their positions, leaving only 31 available for this month. If the seats get filled, you are at a risk of losing this opportunity altogether. As your admission officer, I want to ensure you are well-informed about the current status and the limited availability, allowing you to make an informed decision.
9/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Okay I fully understand
9/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I ask how you are planning to accumulate funds for the same until mid-February?
9/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 71 137 6751: My parents are working on it  they are hoping things would have stabilized by then
10/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear.
I am glad to know that they are working towards it, and I am sure that all their efforts are directed in the right direction. If I may ask, how are they preparing for the same and sourcing the funds for your fee? The reason I am asking is because I am sure you must be preparing for your higher education since you enrolled in the program. While it is completely valid if you are still in the process, I am just inquiring to get a better understanding of it. <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Mostly we just dependent on their salaries they had to clear my little sister's fees first as she had to go back to school this week
10/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite understandable. However, you enrolled in the program in April 2023, and we have been working towards helping you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your education for the past 9 months. I assume you must have made some preparations for the commencement of your higher education journey?
10/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes
10/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you don't mind me asking, what came up? I am only inquiring because I want to get a better understanding of your situation to be able to help you with it. Currently, 76 students have already secured their seats, leaving 24 positions available for this month. I need you to understand that the number of scholarships seats is limited, and unless I have a better understanding of your case I will be unable to explain it to the Academic Board.
10/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 71 137 6751: I think my parents are better suited to answer that question
10/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 71 137 6751: I will ask my dad to answer you
10/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 240 7318: Good afternoon, thank you for the help and support that you have given to my son. However due to financial challenges I request that we put the process on hold up to end of February I think my bank loan with have been approved.
11/1/24, 8:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, sir. Thank you for sharing this information and helping me understand your situation better. May I know if you have any back-up plan in case the bank loan does not get approved on time? I am only asking because the number of scholarship seats are limited, and as Caabilo's admission officer, I would not want him to miss out on this opportunity.
11/1/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 240 7318: Morning, we will try to out source from friends.
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing me with this information, sir. I now have a better understanding of your situation and the plans you have in place for your child's higher education. However, I still have a concern that I wanted to share with you. As we have been discussing, we are in the month of January, and the admissions for the 2024 intake started in August last year. This means students worldwide have been consistently working on their scholarship applications for the past six months, and over 368 students have already secured their scholarship seats. Consequently, only 32 scholarship seats remain for students from Zimbabwe, limiting the number of available scholarship opportunities.
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to help you understand the situation better with an example. Suppose there are 100 scholarship seats that Caabilo wants to enroll in, and only 5 seats are remaining. With the scholarship seats getting occupied, the probability of securing a seat is decreasing as we proceed towards the end of January. There is a high chance that if you delay the process until February, there will be no scholarship seats remaining. So, instead of delaying the admission process until February, if you make the right decision of completing the admission process now, as Caabilo's admission officer, I will ensure that Caabilo secures a scholarship seat at the best university for his higher education here in India. I hope we are on the same page regarding this?
13/1/24, 8:06 AM - +263 77 240 7318: Goodday Ms Siddhi 

Caabilo was wondering  which universities might scholarship opportunities be available for he wanted  to do a bit of his own research 
This was prompted  by the fact that my loan is about to be approved in the next week or so
22/1/24, 11:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Caabilo
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

23/1/24, 3:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, can you please send your A level results?

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 137 6751: I can go on with the Edoofa program but then the new issue that has come up is my crisis where I am being pulled into 2 different paths between my intended career choice and medicine which is something I have always also considered doing and during the course of the year I fell in love with that option again
23/1/24, 3:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: Thank you for opening up Caabilo and what motivates you towards Medicine over Engineering?
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Being able to put smiles on other people's faces and being able to give back to society
23/1/24, 4:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is a wonderful aspiration, Caabilo!
Are there other factors as well that motivates you to this field?
23/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Job security as well , and it's also something I always saw myself doing growing up, I didn't realize when and where I took a liking in technology
