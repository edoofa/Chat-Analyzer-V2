16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bethel,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 961 8360: Good morning  thank you so much
16/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 71 961 8360: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 4:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa added Austin Edoofa
16/1/24, 9:58 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Oky thank you
22/1/24, 2:42 PM - Keshav Edoofa: Good Day, Bethel 
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I am your Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Austin, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online, notify on this group and continue with your admission procedures.

23/1/24, 10:37 AM - Austin Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 10:39 AM - Austin Edoofa: I just checked our records for your A level results *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 961 8360: Thank you Mr  Austin
23/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 71 961 8360: I failed to complete because of financial crisis, so right now i do not have any plans because my mother is not working anymore due to her health issues
23/1/24, 11:03 AM - Austin Edoofa: I am really sorry to hear this Bethel and life is not always the same, there would challenges and obstacles which you need to overcome with determination. We are here to be the catalyst for your growth!
23/1/24, 11:03 AM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 11:03 AM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 961 8360: Currently my family have been facing so many problems lately and is nit well financially stable so my plans are to apply for part-time jobs in order to raise funds
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - Austin Edoofa: I really understand, Bethel,
We are connected to over 300 schools in Zimbabwe, and many parents, educationists and beneficiaries due to which we are aware of the financial hardships, economic challenges and struggles in the country!
23/1/24, 11:33 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 71 961 8360: That is wonderful
23/1/24, 11:50 AM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Bethel,Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 71 961 8360: I think its because everyone have a different background
23/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed, Bether, that is one of the reasons
23/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 12:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Thank you, greatly appreciated
23/1/24, 12:27 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Yes I am
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Yes its accurate
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 71 961 8360: I can't really recall but i assume it was around 750
23/1/24, 1:13 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 1:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
23/1/24, 1:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 1:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
23/1/24, 1:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Yes i am clear
23/1/24, 1:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees which you have missed once due to genuine reasons. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered this time with a *higher quantum of scholarship*. May I know, how far are you and family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 961 8360: Honestly speaking my mind out, i don't think i will be able to pay the amount due to circumstances in my family at the moment
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Austin Edoofa: I do understand the challenges Bethel and how are you planning to proceed your higher education?
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 961 8360: I'm applying for part time jobs to raise funds
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted and is any of your family members willing to assist you here?
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 961 8360: They are already assiting my mother's medical treatments so its also hard for them
