16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 390 2193: Greetings to you
16/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 390 2193: I already handed in my application form for the scholarship & admission requirements including the application fee... I wanted to know if it was possible for me to change a program because i do not want to study law anymore.
17/1/24, 11:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well. You can ignore the above messages please, since we were reaching out to all our student as the results are out so we shared the same with you so you do not have to worry about that.
17/1/24, 11:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, it is possible, however, for us to have a discussion about it kindly allow us time till Monday, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 390 2193: Okay cool
17/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 390 2193: Thank you
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parents and Panashe
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 71 390 2193: I'm doing fine thanks how are you? It is unfortunate that i can not proceed with Edoofa scholarship program, my mother was kindly requesting for application fee
22/1/24, 8:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Panashe, 
I am doing well, by the Grace of God

22/1/24, 8:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 11:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing from you.
22/1/24, 11:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:46 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Morning Panashe and family, 

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further to your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
