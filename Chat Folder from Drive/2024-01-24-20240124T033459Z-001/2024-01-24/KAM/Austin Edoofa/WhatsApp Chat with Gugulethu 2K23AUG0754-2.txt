I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gugulethu,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 278 8359: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Thank you
22/1/24, 11:34 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Gugulethu,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 11:42 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Understood
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parent and Gugulethu
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Yes
23/1/24, 3:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Gugulethu!

23/1/24, 3:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on passing in all A-level subjects*, At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 7:32 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Yes
23/1/24, 8:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Evening Gugulethu!
May I know the reason for the delay in response?
23/1/24, 8:12 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Sorry had network issues
23/1/24, 8:13 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand and are you available now?
23/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Yes
23/1/24, 8:15 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 8:15 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 78 278 8359: We are still deciding I have to fetch my results first
23/1/24, 8:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Gugulethu!
23/1/24, 8:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Yes
23/1/24, 8:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, so are you in touch with any of them?
23/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 78 278 8359: No
23/1/24, 8:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted and I will help you connect with them towards the end of the session
23/1/24, 8:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 8:31 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Maybe due to lack of confidence and faith in themselves
23/1/24, 8:32 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed, that is one of the reasons!
23/1/24, 8:32 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 8:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 8:34 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Definitely
23/1/24, 8:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 78 278 8359: Yes it is
23/1/24, 8:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 9:16 PM - +263 78 278 8359: It's 350 dollars
