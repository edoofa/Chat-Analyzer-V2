22/1/24, 11:26 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Angeline
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *11:30 am CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Angeline,

23/1/24, 1:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results, Angeline* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 372 0205: Thank you yes I am now available for the session
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are welcome!
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
