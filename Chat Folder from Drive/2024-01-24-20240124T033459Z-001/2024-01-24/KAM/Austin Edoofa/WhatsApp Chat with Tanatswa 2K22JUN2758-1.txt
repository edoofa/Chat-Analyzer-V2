I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.

22/1/24, 8:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Tanatswa, At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 4:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 874 5821: I think I know.
23/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 71 874 5821: But you can tell me?

23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
