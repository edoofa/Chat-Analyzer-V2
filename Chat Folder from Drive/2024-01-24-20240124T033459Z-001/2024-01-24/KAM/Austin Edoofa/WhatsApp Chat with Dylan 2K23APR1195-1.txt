*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you made me proud by qualifying for the program.
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
22/1/24, 12:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am doing well by the Grace of God!

22/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Wow this is amazing sir
22/1/24, 12:27 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Dylan and *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results* You have once again made us proud. At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, are you available now so that we can discuss the opportunities in front of you?
22/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Yes sir,also thank you very much
22/1/24, 12:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome, Dylan!
22/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 561 4711: OK sir ,the challenge was that
22/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 561 4711: By that time ,my sister was being enrolled into form 1 so money was needed for especially her yet l was still writing my A level final exams so my father had no choice but to pay for then ma later
22/1/24, 12:34 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

22/1/24, 12:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
22/1/24, 12:35 PM - Austin Edoofa: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
22/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah yes we discussed ,they're are doing their best so that l can be admitted in lndia 's top universities

22/1/24, 2:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is a great vision, Dylan!
22/1/24, 2:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: Dear parents and family members @263714415984 @263773065925 
I would like to welcome you to this group for the admissions and University registration process of Dylan
22/1/24, 2:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: Just before I connected, I had a word with our Head Admissions Officer, Ms Vilsha and was quite taken aback by the news your application is still under process despite the passing of the months since we last interacted. Dylan @263715614711 , you being one of my favourite students, I was intrigued to know the reasons behind the same and I wish to guide you in the very best way possible.
22/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 561 4711: OK sir thank you
22/1/24, 3:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are welcome, Dylan! Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
22/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Why?
22/1/24, 3:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: The Irony is “The masses have never thirsted after truth. Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; We are still indecisive because we are following the opinions and different perspectives, NOT introspecting the Fact and Truth.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - Austin Edoofa: So, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-** As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Yeah TRUE 😁
22/1/24, 3:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: 2. *The Earn While You Learn Program:-* Even though the EWYL program was affected by lessons and exams in Zimbabwe, you will have access to a streamlined process here in India with better earning projects, regular visits by mentors, seminars and training programs which even opens self-financing opportunities. Students have even catered their entire costs through their EWYL earnings.
22/1/24, 3:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 3:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Dylan, do you have any questions for me as of now?
22/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 561 4711: No
22/1/24, 5:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Dylan, so do you recall the aspects and timelines regarding your registration fee payment?
22/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Yes l remember
22/1/24, 5:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Dylan, It is really crucial to reserve your University seat at the earliest with the completion of the registration fees which you have missed once due to genuine reasons. We are currently overwhelmed with applicants. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered this time. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
22/1/24, 6:39 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Yes this time they will make a plan
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Dylan, so by when at the earliest will your family be able to pay the enrollment fees?
22/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 71 561 4711: Let me talk with them
22/1/24, 6:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Dylan, by when will you be able to share feedback with me?
22/1/24, 11:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing from you.
22/1/24, 11:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:36 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Morning Dylan and family, 

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further to your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 561 4711: How are you sir
23/1/24, 10:12 AM - Austin Edoofa: I am doing well by Dylan, thanks for asking!
23/1/24, 10:12 AM - Austin Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the same with your family?
