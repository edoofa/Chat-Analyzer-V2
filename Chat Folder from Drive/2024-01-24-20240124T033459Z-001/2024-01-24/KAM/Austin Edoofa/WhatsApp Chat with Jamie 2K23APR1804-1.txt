16/1/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Jamie,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
22/1/24, 11:36 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Jamie,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 2:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Jamie
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 550 2050: How are you Austin? Jamie is not going forward with the registration process because of some hindrances
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Mrs Maimba!

23/1/24, 2:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process while Jamie being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans for Jamie as of now?
23/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 550 2050: Jamie is a boy
23/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 550 2050: Jamie had decided he now wanted to do accounting.So his sponsor moved on to help his sibling and another relative with their tuition fees.So at the moment he doesn't have funds for his education.
23/1/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: Please excuse me for the same
23/1/24, 3:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted and it is possible to discuss and offer Course in Accounting and most importantly, I understand the financial concern which is also the reason being the career counsellor of Jamie I am here to help you. Based on our discussions and evaluations, *I can even recommend Jamie for a 100% scholarship on tuition and even sponsorship on Accommodation after which she can even self finance her education through the EWYL program.* <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 3:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: I really wish the child will not regret in future due to the challenges faced now. But all this assistance can be provided only through proper evaluations and communication and the first part is the A level result itself. Can you please send his results
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 550 2050: He passed well but he needs to communicate with you himself and he is not present at the moment
23/1/24, 4:33 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand and by what time can we expect to hear from Jamie?
23/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 550 2050: Will talk to you tomorrow morning.
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure, Mrs Maimba!
