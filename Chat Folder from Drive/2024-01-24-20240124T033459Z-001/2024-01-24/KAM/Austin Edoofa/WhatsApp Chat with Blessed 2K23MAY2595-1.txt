12/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessed,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Blessed,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
17/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Greetings, indeed we received your messages
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 677 2874: So we got confused wen we read a message which was talking about issues of health and thought maybe the messages were not for us. We apologize.
17/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I completely understand that. It was a technical error so you can ignore that, please. May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
17/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Yes, i was abke to go through them
17/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 677 2874: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you.
22/1/24, 11:32 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Blessed
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 7:19 AM - +27 74 810 2982: Greetings thank you noted 🙏🏽
23/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 677 2874: Greetings, "Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it for the online meeting at 2:00 pm due to load shedding which is from 12 to 2:30 During this time, there will be no internet connection available. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to come online once the internet connection is back. Thank you for your understanding."
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parents and Blessed
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Greetings, i am ready to begin
23/1/24, 3:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Blessed!
23/1/24, 3:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you couldn't clear the two subjects in A level, may I know, what happened, please?
23/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Wow, that sounds like an incredible event! Thank you for sharing it with me. I can tell you have a great eye for spotting amazing experiences.
23/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Unfortunately, i wasn't well prepared for my examinations and thus i couldn't perform to my full potential.
23/1/24, 4:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Absolutely, Blessed!
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand and sometimes life doesn't go as we think but remember the words

*Bloom where you are grown, else bloom where you are thrown*
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - Austin Edoofa: So , can you send me a picture of your O level results
23/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Okay sir, i will keep it in mind
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 677 2874: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Blessed, now tha the A level results were unfavourable for you, the next option for a University education would be a Diploma in the field of education that you aspire after which you can continue to the Bachelors. Shall I guide you through the same?
23/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 677 2874: I am not aware of how it works with diplomas, i don't know if you can tell me
23/1/24, 4:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Blessed, a Diploma is a 3 year course you can study with O level results and this gives you a lateral entry to a Bachelor degree which means, you can directly start from the second year of your Bachelors and the total duration would be 3 for the the Bachelors
23/1/24, 4:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: So are you still looking forward to pursuing a course in Mechanical Engineering itself?
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 71 677 2874: May i please know, what if i am rewriting the failed exam ?
23/1/24, 5:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: In that case, by when will you be receiving the results?
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 71 677 2874: The results would be out in august
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - Austin Edoofa: In that case, if the result is favourable, you can join this year's intake itself
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - +263 71 677 2874: That would be great, sir.
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed, so have you registered for the same?
23/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Yes, sir. Mathematics and Physics
23/1/24, 5:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is good, ensure to prepare well and give your best, Blessed!
23/1/24, 5:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: As you have mentioned, your results will be out in August which means by that time a major part of the scholarship seats would be full. Therefore, it is ideal to continue with the process now itself and reserve your university seat while you prepare and clear your A level
23/1/24, 5:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Shall I guide you through the same?
23/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Yes please
23/1/24, 5:58 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 5:58 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 6:04 PM - +263 71 677 2874: I don't understand sir, in terms of what regarding your question on decision for the future ??
23/1/24, 6:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: The question is, how are you planning your future and what are the plans you have set for your higher education?.
23/1/24, 6:27 PM - +263 71 677 2874: I'm currently in the process of planning and setting goals for my higher education. I'm  researching the educational requirements for those fields. I'm working on developing a clear plan for the next few years and am open to new opportunities that may come my way. But as of now my main focus is on how i am going to tackle the subjects i didn't perform well
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted and it is good to see that you have a plan!
23/1/24, 6:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 6:58 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 7:00 PM - +263 71 677 2874: yes sir, I still remember a few of them
23/1/24, 7:05 PM - Austin Edoofa: That's great to know, Blessed!
23/1/24, 7:05 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 677 2874: no sir, I do not know
23/1/24, 7:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 7:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 7:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 7:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 7:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 7:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Indeed yes sir. I would greatly appreciate such a rare opportunity like this. I look forward to this too.
23/1/24, 7:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 71 677 2874: sorry sir, but I switched courses to DevOps eengineering
23/1/24, 7:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: May I know, when did you switch the same?
23/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 677 2874: I don't quite remember when but I was told to write an emailregarding the changes and I received a confirmation back
23/1/24, 8:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Please note tha DevOps is a part of Computer Science Engineering and you can opt it is a major in your course after your second year.
23/1/24, 8:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: So do wish to switch to Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering?
23/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 677 2874: Yes sir, that would be great
