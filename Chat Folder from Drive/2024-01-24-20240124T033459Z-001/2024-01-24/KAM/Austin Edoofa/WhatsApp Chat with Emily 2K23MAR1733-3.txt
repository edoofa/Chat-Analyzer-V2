6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Emily,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 6:37 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Congratulations on your journey and All the best.

Happy new year too
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emily,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:13 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Great to hear of this success
8/1/24, 2:13 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Best wishes to you too for 2024
8/1/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, Emily.
8/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 7:06 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: None.
9/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's perfectly fine if you don't have any resolutions for the New Year; sometimes, focusing on perfecting what you currently have can be equally impactful and meaningful.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 10:13 AM - +265 999 85 44 22: In 2023 it was not possible because  the time was close and there was need to organize the finances so it was postponed to 2024
9/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that, dear. May I know if now is a good time to move ahead with your application process to ensure that you are able to secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
16/1/24, 8:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 9:29 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: The MSCE (equivalent OLevel) have been forwarded several times to the Edoofa team including the letter from the Head Teacher confirming  that Emily has never taken JCE exam ...  Do we need to re submit?
22/1/24, 11:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parent and Emily,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 5:38 AM - +265 999 85 44 22: Noted and good morning
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day Mrs Audria and Emily,
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Noted
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Mrs Audria!
23/1/24, 2:31 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Thank you
23/1/24, 2:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Great moments
23/1/24, 2:34 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Emily is a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand Emily's calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Yes
23/1/24, 2:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling details of university fees in Malawi which comes out to be more than $2000.
23/1/24, 3:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:08 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: 👏🏼👏🏼
23/1/24, 3:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like your child are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 4:34 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: No. You may proceed.
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
23/1/24, 4:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Yes, continue
23/1/24, 5:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course Emily has selected for her higher education is Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 5:50 PM - +265 999 85 44 22: Yes
23/1/24, 5:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide your child to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide her with a conducive environment for Emily's holistic development and to fulfil career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what you recall about the same now?
