8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records.

8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

9/1/24, 8:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure, dear. It is so good to hear that your new year started off happily.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
10/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 903 7390: This year  my plan is to give my daughter a chance to do her driving lessons
10/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great, ma'am. Engaging in driving lessons can be immensely beneficial, providing a structured and educational approach to acquiring essential driving skills and ensuring road safety.
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad?
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 903 7390: Most of the times I have netwok challenges that's were I fail to attend the sessions on time for I am in rural areas
16/1/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, parents and Noxolo. May I know how you all are doing today?
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 903 7390: Morning ,we are doing very well .thanks for asking
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 903 7390: How are you and your family
16/1/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Noxolo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I am doing well, thank you for asking. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
18/1/24, 10:54 PM - +263 77 903 7390: A very good evening to you all ,I am doing well.together with my family

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations to Noxolo on the excellent performance in all A-level subjects*, At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while Noxolo being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand her calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.
