16/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Purity,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 8:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Purity.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 12:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, Mr&Mrs Phiri and Purity

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for Purity through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:13 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, please notify me as soon as you are online and I will be guiding you forward through the opportunities in front of you.
22/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Ok thank you
I am now online
22/1/24, 8:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Purity!
How was your day?
22/1/24, 8:58 PM - +263 71 684 4623: It was ok thank you
22/1/24, 8:59 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear that!
22/1/24, 9:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

22/1/24, 9:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
22/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Nothing is solid yet
22/1/24, 9:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Purity, *A total of 370+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for the previous intake*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality. *I am proud to inform you that three students from Nyazura High are a part of them*

*Esnaty Anesuishe Chindondondo*
*Tinevimbo Banhu*
*Munyaradzi Napios Chokutamba*

Do you know them as your seniors?
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 684 4623: The reason why I could not take the previous offer was because it was expensive  and I could not afford

A 50% scholarship on tuition only was really expensive considering that I would need food and  accommodation
So I was forced to drop because of the expenses
22/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yes I do remember them😊
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand and I will be guiding you Purity!
22/1/24, 9:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is great to know
22/1/24, 9:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: Are you connected to anyone of them or did you happen to discuss about  the SLICE CON/24 Industrial visit they participated recently?
22/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Thank you
22/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Uuum no
22/1/24, 9:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are welcome!
22/1/24, 9:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: Alright, I will be guiding you further
22/1/24, 9:17 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
22/1/24, 9:17 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Why
22/1/24, 9:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 9:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:22 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
22/1/24, 9:26 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yes
22/1/24, 9:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering* and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
22/1/24, 9:29 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Is it possible to change that
22/1/24, 9:31 PM - Austin Edoofa: May I know, to which course would you like to change?
22/1/24, 9:33 PM - +263 71 684 4623: To Medicine
22/1/24, 9:34 PM - Austin Edoofa: Purity, Have you researched on the requirements to study Medicine in India?
22/1/24, 9:34 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yh
22/1/24, 9:34 PM - +263 71 684 4623: I need to have Biology
22/1/24, 9:37 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is correct, Purity, after having Biology, Physics and Chemistry, you need to pass the National Entrance Eligiligibility Test(NEET) with top grades to quality, This is one of the toughest exams with students preparing for 1-3 years after A level just to crack this exam.
22/1/24, 9:42 PM - +263 71 684 4623: So you are saying it's impossible for for someone with Maths
Chemistry and Physics to do medicine there
22/1/24, 9:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is correct, Purity
With this combination, you can pursue Medical Courses such as Optometry, Medical Lab technology, Pharmacy etc
22/1/24, 9:43 PM - +263 71 684 4623: And as for the NEET 
It's written after a bit of learning
22/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Oh ok noted
22/1/24, 9:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: It is written after intensive learning, in inorder to register for NEET, the combination of Biology, Physics and Chemistry in A level is required
22/1/24, 9:47 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Noted
22/1/24, 9:49 PM - +263 71 684 4623: If that's the case I  would go for software engineering
22/1/24, 9:55 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted Purity, Software Engineering comes under *Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering* Shall I explain the course for you?
22/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yes please

22/1/24, 10:12 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Noted
22/1/24, 10:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me regarding the course?
22/1/24, 10:15 PM - +263 71 684 4623: No
22/1/24, 10:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
22/1/24, 10:19 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Mm is it the one that helps me to secure a seat at the University
22/1/24, 10:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is right
22/1/24, 10:23 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
22/1/24, 10:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
22/1/24, 10:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1000 + Accommodation Fee $800 + Remaining Fee Components $200 = $2000 per annum.

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 10:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2000-$1000 = $1000) and this remaining fee of $1000 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $500 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $500 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
22/1/24, 10:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
22/1/24, 10:31 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yes
22/1/24, 10:35 PM - +263 71 684 4623: I'm lost somewhere
Does that mean if I pay the registration fee 
I would have covered everything for the year tuition accommodation
22/1/24, 10:37 PM - +263 71 684 4623: And also here the registration fee you said it's $1000 and the other $1000 will corver tution and accommodation
22/1/24, 10:37 PM - +263 71 684 4623: For the year
22/1/24, 10:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: No please, I have recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship and as per this example if you pay the registration fee, then you will be left with $1000 from the cost of education, which can be paid in two equal installments. First part after your arrival and second part by December 2024 or before your second semester commence.
22/1/24, 10:38 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is correct, in short the registration fee is a one time payable fee which is already a part of the cost of education itself.
22/1/24, 10:39 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Ok noted
22/1/24, 10:39 PM - +263 71 684 4623: I guess this was an example right
22/1/24, 10:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: Absolutely Purity, do you have other questions for me?
22/1/24, 10:45 PM - +263 71 684 4623: No
22/1/24, 10:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, how are the preparations in your family progressing towards the registration fee and how far have you managed to raise as of now?
22/1/24, 10:47 PM - +263 71 684 4623: Yh I will have to confirm with them 
But as of now things are tough
22/1/24, 10:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand and I see you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns, challenges and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this.
