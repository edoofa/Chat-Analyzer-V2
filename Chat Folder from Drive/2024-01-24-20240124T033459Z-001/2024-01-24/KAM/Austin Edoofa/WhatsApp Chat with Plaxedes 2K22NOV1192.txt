16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Plaxedes ,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 690 6202: How are you Mr Millan
She will send results soon

16/1/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parent and Plaxedes @263776798904 @263772214487 ,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead. <This message was edited>

She will get in touch @11:30
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parent and Plaxedes
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Sorry lm late
23/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes let's begin
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Plaxedes!
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: I understand

23/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on your good A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you Mr Austin lm.very glad to have this conversation  with you so the reason why  l wasn't able to complete with the university registration  process is because my parents  could not afford the $700 which was required
As far as l remember  the last time l.had the conversation  with him he was not pleased with the idea of me learning abroad but   he is trying to fix something he will.respond once  he is online

Thank you sir
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: I really understand the challenges,Plaxedes
We are associated with more than 300 schools in Zimbabwe, with 2500+ beneficiaries and their happy families which means we are aware of the economic constraints, challenges and hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and I have decided to assist you in person to guide you through most affordable opportunities!
23/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 679 8904: I will get back to you once l.talk with my parents
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Plaxedes, by when can I expect your feedback as I have been planning to recommend your application for a 100% scholarship on tuition and even a sponsorship on Accommodation thereby even self-financing your education through the EWYL program. The 100% scholarship seats are very limited and we are overwhelmed with applicants!
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, I am expecting a feedback at the earliest so that I can guide you through the best possible opportunities
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Oky sir
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 679 8904: My parents said you can go ahead with the process sir
23/1/24, 4:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Noted Plaxedes!
23/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Oky thank you

23/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Woow  this is wonderful ❤️
23/1/24, 4:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Plaxedes
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yah l.know sir
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
