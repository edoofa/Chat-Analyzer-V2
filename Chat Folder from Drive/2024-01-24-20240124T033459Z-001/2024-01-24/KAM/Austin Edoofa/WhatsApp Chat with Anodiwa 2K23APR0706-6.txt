I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest Group of  Institutions.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of  Institutions as a collective?

4/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you have missed the deadline date for the registration process at Quest Group of Institutions. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.

4/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you are having financial concern at the moment and you are trying to complete the payment. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. I understand that you are facing financial challenges at the moment, and we will try our best to assist you. 

As you have not shared your concern with us earlier, I am bit concerned for you. Hence, I would like to understand your plans to complete the registration procedure, Could you please share it with us ?

Am happy you have shown and expressed much concerns for us. Financially we have not been stable lately. Given that we now have the two of them on board, Anodiwa and Anesu. We are trying our level best to make sure they both reserve their university seats. And Am proud as an Edoofian that with God everything positive is possible thanks to you. If you may give us upto end of January 2024 to complete registration processes payment for Anodiwa then we go onto Anesu's payments by the end of February 2024 Am sure we will be done. I hope you understand where we are coming from, given that our source of income as a sole proprietory family is meager, so insignificant and easily constrainable.

16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 864 1364: Thank  you Ashie. We are all well and so delighted to hear the good explorative news. Thank you and yes we started our new year 2024 on a very busy schedule. Hoping that we will continue  in this mode raising funds to make sure our twin girls Anesu and Anodiwa  pursue  and achieve their dreams unstoppably
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263718641364 . With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

Wish if we were also there to enjoy💥💥💥🔥anyway thank you and we pray that next time such events are held please don't leave us out. Create space and feasibility for us to participate as we are already part of the Edoofian family
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear your thoughts, we will indeed invite you in such events. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am
16/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 71 694 6404: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 864 1364: We are proud to say Anodiwa had the toughest time at school but managed to come up with 5 points. Let's chat and agree on terms whether she qualified for the course she wanted or not
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:50 PM - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am 
Thank you so much for the encouragement and  hospitality. I'm very grateful for the opportunity and If possible l would love to continue pursuing the course. Thank you again for your kindness and support
22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parents and Anodiwa,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Hello am online for an hour from now 1530hrs to 1630hrs. Can we proceed
22/1/24, 3:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Mr Chaurura!
22/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 3:46 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations to Anodiwa on A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember Anotiwa;s passion for career and goals, making her one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans for your choldren as of now?
22/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 71 291 4917: That's great
22/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 291 4917: We couldn't pay to reserve Anodiwas seat at one of the universities due to financial constraints. We now have two of them on enrolment. Anodiwa and her twin sister Anesu. We managed to pay the initial 200usd for Anesu and for Anodiwa we paid the initial 350usd plus 20usd making it 370usd.
22/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 71 291 4917: January 2024 has not been quite good for us as we failed to raise the 300usd required to reserve Anodiwas seat at the said university. So we kindly asked for your kind Administration to allow us extend payments for the two to end.of February 2024 to enable us to clear Anodiwas 300usd and Anesus 150usd respectively. We got a nod from.your office and a dire promise to look I to the matter accordingly. Now as we awaited results for two girls, we were also waiting for a positive persuasive response from your respected office to allow us complete payments for two by end of February 2024
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - Austin Edoofa: I do understand the challenges and being a parent of two children who completed their A level, the struggles and sacrifices are really genuine and understandable. This is also the reason, I have taken this initiative to connect and discuss the way forward with you despite the huge rush of applicants!
22/1/24, 4:03 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe. <This message was edited>

22/1/24, 4:04 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this while considering your children's higher education*
22/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Yes we did and we know for sure these are real figures for the respective fees
22/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 291 4917: That is why we had to seek scholarship.. apart from the fact that securing the place at such universities is cumbersome.  That being the major concern why we had to seek your audience in this regard. We direly need the twin girls to proceed and complete their tertiary education with Edoofa without fail. Please assist us wherever possible, flex the conditions to accommodate us the less privileged. That is my kind request. Only of there was a chance of me getting employed at the university probably all this was going to be feasible.
22/1/24, 4:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: I really understand the challenges and I will ensure your children receive the best and most affordable opportunities through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Mr Chaurura!
22/1/24, 4:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: May I know the full name and Admissions group name of Anesu please
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Wooow am more than proud to hear such wonderful news. Did you hlget the last part of my chat here👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻 *ONLY IF THERE COULD BE A CHANCE FOR ME GETTING EMPLOYED BY EDOOFA UNIVERSITY, PROBABLY ALL THE WORRIES WOULD VARNISH*
22/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 291 4917: OK just a moment. I'm sending it in a few minutes

22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Let me share all families of students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
22/1/24, 6:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
22/1/24, 6:19 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Sir Austin surely am touched. I wish my twin girls to realize their dreams sooner🎯
22/1/24, 6:29 PM - +263 71 291 4917: No
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 6:50 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 6:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your children's career, aren't you?
22/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 581 7170: That's fine I will share them here as we proceed. Probably tomorrow
22/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Definitely I am. This is just unhead of in normal procedural universities worldwide
22/1/24, 7:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: That would be fine!
22/1/24, 7:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: Absolutely, Mr Charurura!
22/1/24, 8:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course Anodiwa has been selected fr higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and the intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
22/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 581 7170: Very accurate Sir Austin
22/1/24, 8:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending Anodiwa's application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
22/1/24, 8:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 8:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

I hope this is clear
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 291 4917: 🙏🏼🙏🏼thank you so much eysh I'm so proud God answered my prayers🪇🪇🪇
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Very clear Sir. U mean Anodiwa should pay 650usd within 3 days of her arrival at the EDOOFA University In India
22/1/24, 9:09 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Maybe you need to elaborate clearly on column 4, given your explanation underneath that *Registration fee will be waived...*
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - +263 71 291 4917: So total amount due as of now is *$650* and after this payment, which would be due this August 2024, Anodiwa would be good to go for the whole academic year. Is that correct Sir Austin??
22/1/24, 9:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is correct
22/1/24, 9:29 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you have other questions for me please?
22/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 78 211 5564: Thank you so much for such an amazing gesture Mr Austin. If I may ask, is there any other payment we are going to pay from now for Anodiwa apart from the $650 indicted above Sir? If not at all, What are the next steps we have to take now as we try very hard to secure Anodiwa's amazingly discounted total fees of $650 for this entire Academic year August 2024-July 2025
22/1/24, 9:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome, I guess there is a misunderstanding in the case of Registration fee
22/1/24, 9:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: In the example, we considered the cost of education as $1650 and the registration fee as $1000 which would be waived from the cost of education which means you are supposed to pay the $1000 after receiving the offer letter and will be left with the $650 for the first year
22/1/24, 10:40 PM - +263 78 211 5564: All the same this is awesome. We are more than pleased for such a kind gesture. So as we speak now please   confirm that we are to look for 650usd payable wi" in August 2024 when Anodiwa will be admitted into the University??
22/1/24, 11:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 11:14 PM - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. Let us enjoy the viewing. Good night and sweet dreams Sir🪇🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
