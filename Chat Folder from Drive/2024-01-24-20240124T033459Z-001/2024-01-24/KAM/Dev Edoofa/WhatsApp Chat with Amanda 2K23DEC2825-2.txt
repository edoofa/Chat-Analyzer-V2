I completely understand that Amanda is in school and needs to attend the lessons, which I am extremely happy to hear about. Gaining knowledge should not be hindered. Since Amanda is going to be unavailable for her sessions, I believe parents should take part in these sessions to make sure that Amanda's process is not going off track in terms of the timeline.

22/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Mine was good too. Thanks for asking.
22/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Amanda's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes please I am ready.
22/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I have gone through the 6 stages and what I need now is the explanations.
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 385 0175: I have gone through the two and I hope more light will be given on step two.
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: The Statement of Purpose is a form that is to be prepared by a student to send to the universities so that universities can recognize if he/she is worthy of a scholarship as well it helps them to get insights about the students and make the necessary decisions. We will help you prepare the same soon. Till then we can move forward. So shall we?
22/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Thank you very much. I now understand and we can move forward.
22/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 12:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes I am following. You can proceed.
22/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 385 0175: Yes they are clear.
22/1/24, 12:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
