If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Yes I am

18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 616 8836: You can go ahead now
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these steps are clear?
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Okey thank you so much
18/1/24, 2:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!  If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 616 8836: Sorry I have got network challenge but as for now we may start
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

18/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
18/1/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263776168836 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection.

23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 2. Explain the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.

Rights are what one want others to do for him/her, whereas duties are those acts that one should perform for others. Thus a right comes with an obligation to show respect for the rights of others. The obligations that  accompany rights are in form of duties.

Rights and duties are interrelated in every social and political activity of man. While rights exalt individual liberty, duties express the dignity of that liberty. Duties of a juridical nature presuppose others of amoral nature which support them in principle and constitute their basis.

The main difference between human rights and civil rights include that human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state .

Civil rights are legal rights that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex and other characteristics. Human rights are rights you are born with-you have them simply by being human, whether or not they have been put into the form of a law in the country where you reside.

Civil rights are granted by government and human rights are rights that everyone has simply because they are human.
Thus, these are the difference between human rights and civil rights
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?

One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the clients innocence.

A prosecutor and a defense attorney are both lawyers who have completed law school and passed the bar examination. However, a defense attorney defends the individual that a prosecutor is trying to convince the jury is guilty.

Typically the prosecutor will ask easy soft ball questions like what did you see? or what did you do? This style of questioning is called direct examination and it is completely different from cross examinations. A prosecutor's job is easier than a defense attorney generally .
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 4. Why am l interested in criminal law?
Criminal justice is a fantastic field to enter if you want to do something different from sitting at a desk all day and if you want to avoid being bored.  Those considering a career in the criminal justice sector may also benefit significantly from their formative experiences while working there. 

The reason makes criminal law interesting is that the wrong committed is considered against society, not just the individual. This makes studying and practicing criminal law much more exciting and challenging at the same time.

I'm passionate about my community and determined to do my part to keep residents safe. Criminal justice gives a chance to accomplish just that while also pursuing a unique career path that is simultaneously exciting, interesting and highly gratifying.

If someone is facing criminal charges that may result in paying a fine, probation or possible jail time, they need a defence lawyer to represent them. 

One likely needs a defense lawyer if they have been charged with a felony, but may need one for a miscellaneous charges such as a traffic ticket
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 616 8836: 5. I am a strategic thinker and l have problem solving abilities. The best lawyers are creative especially when managing a firm and representing clients at the same time. My ability to think creatively can make the difference between finding a unique solution or ultimately losing in court.

I have knowledge of law practices , communication, protocols and regulations, interpersonal skills and the ability to think outside the box and solve problems.

Soft skills play a significant role in the legal profession complementing of technical knowledge and experience that lawyers possess. These personal attributes and abilities are essential for effective communication, collaboration and interaction with others in the legal field.

I have the ability to conduct legal research and writing, analysing the law , explaining legal  information to clients, providing legal advice , being knowledgeable and remaining current in legal events.
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the responses to the documents. May I please get to know if you are done with the Statement of Purpose as well?

23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 616 8836: I will keep on opening it , I will let you know when am done

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

23/1/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263776168836! We will have our session tomorrow at 11:30 am to take forward our conversation. Make sure you are filling out the SOP form before that. Till then I hope you have a great day ahead!
