6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 131 9112: Thanks you very much
We are clear
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind, and ensure that your admission process is on track. I am aware that Tendai is now at school. Hence, I wanted to understand if you as parents/guardians will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?

9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Tendai will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Tendai is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Good evening
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: My day was alright, thank you
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too

15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendai!
I hope you are doing great!  Kindly provide me some time to realign my schedule according to your availability and then I will share my confirmation. Till the time, please be patient and allow us some time.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 340 7203: noted, looking forward to the discussion
16/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 340 7203: we can proceed
16/1/24, 3:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 340 7203: please go ahead and explain, i have gone through the image
16/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes they are clear
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay, i am following, so do we have instances were one receives multiple offer letters
16/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263773407203. There can be such kind of instances. Can we now proceed forward with the session?
16/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 77 340 7203: yes lets proceed
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay so does the registraation fees differ with universities?
16/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 340 7203: will this mount be used s part of tuition fees or its purely registration fees
16/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 340 7203: will there be  grace period for raising the said funds, for instance after receiving the letter of intent how much time do we hve until the registration fee is due
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263773407203. The registration fee differs according to the university.
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.
16/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
16/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 340 7203: perfect, that is what i had heard but just wanted confirmation that we are still on the same page, thank you
16/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay noted, we can move
16/1/24, 4:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps and  If we are on the same page shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 340 7203: okay
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 4:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Yes please go ahead
16/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*
