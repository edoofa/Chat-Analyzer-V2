18/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Amanda. I hope you are doing well and are off to a wonderful start to your day.

18/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: We have our session right now. May I please know if you are ready for our conversation?
18/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Afternoon Sir.Am ready

18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents. I have taken note of them and will update them in our records!
18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Ready
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Done Sir
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Clear Sir
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 116 6703: Am following Sir.
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 116 6703: They are very clear sir
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 322 2565: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 322 2565: <Media omitted>

22/1/24, 11:35 PM - +263 78 322 2565: 2) To commence with Rights are entitlements that an individual has that should be respected and protected by others. Duties, on the other hand, are obligations that an individual has to others. While rights and duties may seem to be opposites, they are actually complementary and interdependent. Rights can only be exercised if there are corresponding duties that others have to respect and uphold them. Similarly, duties only make sense when there are corresponding rights to which they relate.Human rights and civil rights are closely related, but they do have some key differences. Human rights are universal and inalienable, they apply to all people regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or other factors. They are also considered to be inherent and inviolable, meaning that they cannot be taken away and must be protected at all costs. Civil rights are specific legal rights that are granted to individuals by the government, usually through legislation. Civil rights are more limited in scope and vary from country to country. They can also be changed or revoked by the government.



3) To begin with , there is a difference between a prosecutor and an attonery .A prosecutor and an attorney may seem similar, but there are some key differences between the two roles. An attorney is a general term that refers to any licensed legal professional. This can include prosecutors, as well as defense attorneys, corporate lawyers, and many other types of lawyers. A prosecutor, on the other hand, is a specific type of attorney who works for the government and represents the state in criminal cases. Prosecutors typically work to prove that the defendant is guilty, while defense attorneys work to prove their client's innocence. Prosecutors also have a higher burden of proof, as they must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.



4) Civil law refers to the branch of law that deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, rather than criminal offenses.Iam intrested in this branch as Civil lawyers covers a wide range of issues, including contract disputes, personal injury cases, and property disputes. I also want to take part in civil law as it is my  goal  to resolve the dispute and reach a fair settlement for both parties, rather than to punish the guilty party. In addition iam intrested in Civil law because I wish to resolve through negotiations or mediation,also through a trial in a civil court. Civil law is different from criminal law, which deals with offenses against the state and focuses on punishment and this is the intresting part I endure most.



5) I believe I will be a successful lawyer because of the skills that I have . First and foremost, I am  able able to communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing. This includes me being able to argue a case persuasively, as well as draft clear and concise documents such as contracts and briefs. Another key skill that I have is critical thinking and problem-solving, as lawyer I must be able to analyze complex legal issues and find creative solutions. Additionally, I  a have strong research skills to be able to find relevant case law and other legal information to support their arguments. Finally, Ia have strong interpersonal skills to work well with clients. With all this I think I will be a successful Lawyer in the future
