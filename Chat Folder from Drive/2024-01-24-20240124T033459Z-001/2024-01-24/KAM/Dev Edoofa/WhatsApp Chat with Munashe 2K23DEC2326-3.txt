8/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
8/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Munashe EWYL23E1147*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 525 2551: Acknowledged sir
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with Munashe's counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into his academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring his access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about his counseling session with his counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
9/1/24, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe!
I hope all of you are doing great! We are here to help you and launch your career to greater heights and with that, I wanted to address that since we were not able to take forward our conversation yesterday. So may I please know if you are facing any kind of challenges in attending the sessions?

If not, we will have our session today at 10:30 am.
9/1/24, 9:23 AM - +263 77 525 2551: Morning sir,is it possible to do the session on Friday and Saturday
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munashe!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
