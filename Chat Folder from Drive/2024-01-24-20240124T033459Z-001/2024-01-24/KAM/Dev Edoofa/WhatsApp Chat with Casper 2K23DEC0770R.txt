This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes we can start
19/1/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 132 2777: I'm done sir
19/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 71 132 2777: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir they are clearly
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes yes i am
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have taken note of these steps?
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i have
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir we can
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Yes sir i am excited to see them
19/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
19/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

23/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Very well sir
23/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I would like you to please elaborate on what were you able to understand from each of the 4 videos?
23/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Ok 
So from the first video i undeestood that the next step is the statement of purpose and the statement of purpose helps a student to display first impressions 
So the statement will include my documents and your recomendations from the counselling session and the statement of purpose 
The SOP is there to convince the schools why the student is worthy of the scholarship
It also includes a studen's achievements and why they choose the program
And also that when you get the form you must fill it immediately
23/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 132 2777: So according to the first video i have to ask for the SOP document
23/1/24, 1:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the first video. Please let me know about your understanding of the remaining videos. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 132 2777: In the second video they were now talking about the step 5,which is the university interaction 
So me as a student i need to get prepared enough for the interaction
So the faster a student watches the video the quicker they you will be prepared 
It also states the main reason for the success of the students which is the years of hard work put by admissioners you know to makes sure that the schools that their students are going to learn in are in good physical conditions 
And all the schools that a student goes there will be edoofa's EWYL program <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 71 132 2777: Well in the third video i was really touched by the issue of the student who lost 1300 to some thieves 
Well indeed there are others who are doing than cause they know that students in africa are desperate for better education then they use that to their own advantage 
So thats why i want to thank you administrators for your out standing job in assuring us the students on how we can rely on edoofa
Well it also talked about edoofa not only being a program that provides admissions in schools but creates a carrier opportunity to students
It also stated about having a huge vision of opportunities and not to be just based on one but to be open minded and in my own words learn to be led to the brighter future
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 132 2777: And now the last video this one was amaizing 
I was really inspired by the 5th grader who was able to challange the status because the child saw an opportunity and decided to go for it despite the odds and that is really amazing because that is being open-minded and allowing yourself to be tought 
 This whole dialogue tought me to just following instructions and allow my superiors to teach me into the right pathway of success and achievements 
That was wonderful
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your detailed understanding of the videos. I believe you were able to feel the essence of these videos and were able to infer the information conveyed in the video.
