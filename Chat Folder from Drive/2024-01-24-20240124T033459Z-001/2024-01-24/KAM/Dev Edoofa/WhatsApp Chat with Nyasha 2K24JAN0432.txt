22/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's crucial to print out these forms before our reconnection on January 23rd, as the next batch for the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled for 30th January. Starting from our sessions on the 23rd, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on the steps needed before January 29th. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on January 30th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.

23/1/24, 6:31 AM - +263 71 692 1784: By 10:30 l will be in a lesson at school so can we move to 1:00pm
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Mukarati and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well. I understand your concern and I know that you are still in A- Level and have not appeared for the exams, so for the time being, you can request a letter of Recommendation from your school for which we have the following guidelines.
23/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Nyasha! You can change your course even after the results are declared, however, you need to understand that in the Indian Education System, your eligibility for a course depends on the combination of subjects the student had in school. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
23/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, Nyasha, for today we can have our session at 1:00 pm.
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Mukarati and Nyasha!
