For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes we may start
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 78 811 4776: I'm done
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes they are clear you may continue please
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes I am following
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes they are
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes we may start
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
28/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 78 811 4776: Yes you may move on
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tinotenda, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

2/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *2. My understanding of UI/UX and its usage  in today's digital world are*

In digital design, user interface (UI) refers to the interactivity, look, and feel of a product screen or web page, while user experience (UX) covers a user’s overall experience with the product or website.

To create engaging UI, designers consider these elements Page layout, Color scheme and font selection, interactive elements and Wireframe and prototype fidelity

The UX design process involves market research, wireframe development, prototype testing, and cross-functional collaboration.

The usage of UI/ UX

Increased Conversion Rates:Improved user experience which leads to increased user satisfaction and engagement rates. 

Higher Rate of User Growth:A core aspect of UI/UX design is attending to the needs of target users. With such a foundational principle, digital products are guaranteed to pique the interests of more and more customers every year.

Increased In-House Productivity:
A streamlined and well-designed website or application can have a positive impact on a company’s staff. Intuitive UI/UX designs in websites and apps help create smooth workflows for employees.

Search Engine Optimization Boost:
As stated before UI/UX design is a central aspect of Google’s Core Web Vital. Investing in the right UI/UX design practices can certainly help websites improve their SERP rankings.
2/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *3.My understanding of the OSI model are*

OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.

The 7 layers of the OSI model are Physical Layer, Data-Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, Application Layer

Physical Layer 's main functionality is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.It is the lowest layer of the OSI model.It also establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection.
It specifies the mechanical, electrical and procedural network interface specifications.

Data-Link layer is responsible for the error-free transfer of data frames.It defines the format of the data on the network.It provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices.
It is mainly responsible for the unique identification of each device that resides on a local network.
It contains two sub-layers which are the Logical Link control layer, and the Media Access control layer. The Logical Link control layer is responsible for transferring the packets to the Network layer of the receiver that is receiving, Media Access control layer is used for transferring the packets over the network.

Network Layer is a layer 3 that manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network. It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors. Routers are the layer 3 devices, they are specified in this layer and used to provide the routing services within an internetwork.

Transport Layer is a Layer 4 ensures that messages are transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data.
The main responsibility of the transport layer is to transfer the data completely. It receives the data from the upper layer and converts them into smaller units known as segments.The two protocols used in it are transmission control protocol an user datagram protocol.

Session layer is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices.Session layer acts as a dialog controller that creates a dialog between two processes or we can say that it allows the communication between two processes which can be either half-duplex or full-duplex.

Presentation layer is mainly concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between the two systems.It acts as a data translator for a network.
This layer is a part of the operating system that converts the data from one presentation format to another format.The Presentation layer is also known as the syntax layer.It deals with translation, encryption and compression of data.

Application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network service. It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation, etc.
An application layer is not an application, but it performs the application layer functions. This layer provides the network services to the end-users.
2/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *4.My understanding about programming and programming languages and which languages are most widely used in today's applications and why?*

Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.

A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.

Python is the most used language in the world now because of its nature too Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and also because of its libraries collections. Python is versatile. Python is a very versatile and highly-utilized language. Python's versatility has led it to be used for everything from basic web development to complex AI systems and embedded projects. Furthermore, Python has the ability to act as a "glue" code that connects different programming components together to interact and run on every operating system.  



The second language is Javascript  
​
One of the most used programming languages by developers in 2020, as per GitHub, will be Javascript. It is being increasingly used in the game development sector and Internet of Things (IoT). It is also one of the core existing technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.
 
Features of Javascript:
Interpreted and light-weighted programming language
Object-oriented computer programming language, that is commonly used for the purpose of creating interactive effects within the internet browsers
Plays a significant role in front-end development for popular websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Google, Wikipedia, and Amazon.
Optional static typing features to the language software can be added by using Typescript which is a superset of JavaScript
 
Advantages of Javascript:
Speed-driven
Simple to use
Interoperable
Adaptable to rich interfaces
Extended functionalities
 
Disadvantages of Javascript:
Security issues from the client’s side
Security threat for client-side scripts
Browser support interpretations

The third one is C, C is a multi-paradigm, procedural language. It supports structured programming, meaning it’s a low-level language that doesn’t require a lot of runtime to support. This makes C a great language for operating systems, hardware drivers, and kernel-level software.

An may more like HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL
2/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 811 4776: *5.The difference between compilers and intepreters*

A Compiler is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. The work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code (format of 0s and 1s) so that computers can understand. Whilst

An Interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc.

The compiler saves the Machine Language in form of Machine Code on disks.

The Interpreter does not save the Machine Language.

Compiled codes run faster than Interpreter.

Interpreted codes run slower than Compiler.

The compiler generates an output in the form of (.exe).

The interpreter does not generate any output.

The compiler can see code upfront which helps in running the code faster because of performing Optimization.

The Interpreter works by line working of Code, that’s why Optimization is a little slower compared to Compilers.

CPU utilization is more in the case of a Compiler.

CPU utilization is less in the case of a Interpreter.

Compilers more often take a large amount of time for analyzing the source code.

In comparison, Interpreters take less time for analyzing the source code

Execution of the program takes place only after the whole program is compiled. In Compiler

Execution of the program happens after every line is checked or evaluated.In Interpreter

C, C++, C#, etc are programming languages that are compiler-based.

Whilst, Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc are programming languages that are interpreter-based.

6/1/24, 10:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries!
6/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 811 4776: Okay
6/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
6/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
6/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 811 4776: I'm going back to school this month so my parents are preparing my school fees 
So they will pay the remaining enrollment fee afterwards
6/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for updating me on your situation. I understand that you and your family are preparing for your school finances, including the remaining amount of enrollment fee that you need to complete your enrollment formalities with Edoofa. You mentioned that your parents are currently focusing on preparing your school fees, and then they will contribute towards your enrollment fee. 

To better understand your situation, I would like to get some more information from you. According to our records, the deadline for the remaining $150 payment is January 20th, which is in 15 days. Can you please let me know how much you have been able to save for the payment and when you are planning to make the deposit? This will help me update the team accordingly.
15/1/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
How are you all doing?
15/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 123 6809: Good morning

15/1/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing fine as well. Thank you so much for asking.
15/1/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I please know if you are ready to take part in our session?
15/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 123 6809: Am sorry Tinotenda he is at school at boarding school he stays there so I don't know if he is free
15/1/24, 11:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand, @263771236809. Since Tinotenda is going to be unavailable for further sessions, I believe that parents should actively participate in these sessions to take forward the conversation as delays in these sessions can seriously affect the timelines of the admission journey. I hope you understand this?
15/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok thank you
15/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! So may I know if you are available to take part in the session right now?

15/1/24, 9:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
16/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotenda!
How are you all doing today?
16/1/24, 4:42 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Good afternoon sir
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!
How are you all doing today?
17/1/24, 3:09 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Good afternoon. We're all fine
17/1/24, 3:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
17/1/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you available for our session right now?
17/1/24, 3:12 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes we can proceed
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: There was a technical glitch which led to a delay in the conversation. I hope you understand?
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we proceed forward?
17/1/24, 4:17 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes let's proceed
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
17/1/24, 4:21 PM - +27 78 568 0891: I can't get hold of my wife I think they got no power but she is supposed to be pay the balance
17/1/24, 4:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @27785680891!, We can take forward our session!
17/1/24, 4:46 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Ok
17/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for Tinotenda's higher education is Bachelors in Computer Application and it's my understanding that Tinotenda is planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/1/24, 4:48 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes it is accurate
17/1/24, 5:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
17/1/24, 5:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
17/1/24, 5:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
17/1/24, 6:04 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes would really love to know more about the plan
17/1/24, 10:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that. But since our operational hours are over now, we will reconnect tomorrow at 3:30 PM to take forward our sessions and our discussion on the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. Till then wishing you a blessed night.
17/1/24, 10:14 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Ok thank you very much
18/1/24, 8:11 AM - +263 77 123 6809: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @27785680891 @263771236809! I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful day. Thank you for sharing the receipt of the payment. I have taken note of it and will update it in our records.
18/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have our session today. May I know if you are available to take forward our conversation?
18/1/24, 4:06 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Good afternoon yes we can carry on
18/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Picking up our conversation from the last session, let me introduce to you the Edoofa Secure Plan.
18/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
18/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
18/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
18/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
18/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - +27 78 568 0891: You can carry on
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
18/1/24, 4:29 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes go ahead
18/1/24, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
18/1/24, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
18/1/24, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
18/1/24, 4:45 PM - +27 78 568 0891: That's very true
18/1/24, 4:45 PM - +27 78 568 0891: I do agree with you
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
18/1/24, 4:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
18/1/24, 4:51 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes it is viable
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
18/1/24, 4:54 PM - +27 78 568 0891: How long this will take. By 530pm I got somethings to do
18/1/24, 4:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: It will be done before that @27785680891! I want you to be patient as this plan is for your benefit in preparing you to handle your finances for Tinotenda's higher education. I hope you understand?
18/1/24, 4:58 PM - +27 78 568 0891: It's ok let's carry on
18/1/24, 4:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering the above-mentioned constraints that are usually faced by the people of Zimbabwe, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
18/1/24, 5:03 PM - +27 78 568 0891: How genuine this is and how secure it is considering the scams happening.
18/1/24, 5:08 PM - +27 78 568 0891: If I understand well from your previous conversations with Tinotenda; you were saying he has to get an offer letter first from a specific University then after that the payment will proceed. I'll also be very comfortable saving the money this side and pay it when it's due
18/1/24, 5:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: @27785680891 Edoofa has been working in this field of education for the past 15 years and has been providing Quality higher education at an affordable cost to more than 5000+ students. We are determined to not only help students plan their higher education but also help them plan their finances for further education. The Edoofa Secure Plan is designed to help students and their families prepare the finances for higher education here in India. As mentioned above, 20-30% of students who enroll in our program are not able to come to India, due to insufficient planning of finances. To tackle this situation, the Edoofa Secure Plan was introduced.

I can completely understand your concern about scams happening all around and just like you other parents may also have had the same concerns in the past. But if you look at our journey, you will realize that Edoofa is one of the only genuine organizations that is helping students pursue their education and making students employable. 

 Edoofa uses legitimate payment gateways of money transfer for example banks and at the same time, scammers use ways like bitcoins and other unreliable gateways. I hope you can understand what I am trying to convey to you?
18/1/24, 5:33 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Bear with me too and thank you for elaborating further.
19/1/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents!
You are most welcome @27785680891! We are here to take care of your concerns and help stay on the right path of seeing your children become successful individuals not only in their professional careers but life as well. We will reconnect today at 4:00 PM to take forward our conversation. Till then I hope you have a great day!
19/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @27785680891 !
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
19/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Good afternoon I think he is busy his last seen is at 6 am
19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @lyona! I understand. Are you available for the session?
19/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Yes
19/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
19/1/24, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Picking up from our last conversation with your husband,  considering the constraints faced by the people of Zimbabwe, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 123 6809: You can explain
19/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
19/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
19/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Am sorry you mean $150 or $15 here
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: here in this example it means $15. It was just to help you understand ho wit works.
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok
19/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 123 6809: So here you mean we must deposit $150 per month 
What about if we don't have that amount every month
19/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Bcz we have challenges for fees
19/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern @263771236809. May I know about your plans for the preparation of the finances for Tinotenda's higher education as this plan is designed to help you prepare for the same?
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok 
We are planning to run a project so that we can rise our sons fees 
So we can rise it maybe at once
19/1/24, 5:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, @263771236809! What we can do is that we can discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan and then you can decide what is going to be more viable for you. Please let me know what do you feel about this?
19/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Let us discuss
19/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great, If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
19/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
19/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
19/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok I understand let us discuss this with Tinotenda,'s father then will come back to you
19/1/24, 5:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: There are more aspects of the plan, let me explain them to you as well
19/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok
19/1/24, 5:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
19/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 123 6809: I want to know
Do we pay before addimition or after addimition
19/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 123 6809: I mean to say when my son got a university then I will pay the $150 per month
19/1/24, 5:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: No, @263771236809. You will have to pay $150 per month from the next month. The money you deposit every month will be used to pay off your registration fee as well as the first year of fees.

Since this concern has been raised from your side, may I know if you were following the above conversation regarding this plan? <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Thats why am was asking I need to know
19/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Because if you are saying starting from next month Feb what about if I don't have that amount what are we going to do
19/1/24, 5:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know! You can refer to the above conversation which I had with Mr. Emmanuel to better understand the Edoofa Secure Plan here.

And as for the initiation of the plan, as we discussed let me explain to you the whole plan so that you can discuss it with your family. If you feel that you are not comfortable with it, you can opt out of it as well.
19/1/24, 5:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: We can also discuss when you feel you can start with the plan later if you are interested in this plan.
19/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Ok thank you
19/1/24, 5:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Shall we move ahead?
20/1/24, 3:47 PM - +27 78 568 0891: I followed your conversation with my wife it's ok you can go ahead
22/1/24, 9:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!  We were not able to take forward our conversation as our working hours were over when you replied. We will reconnect at 4:30PM today to take forward our conversation. Till then I hope you have a wonderful day today!
22/1/24, 4:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Tarirai and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 123 6809: Good afternoon sir
Mr Tarirai is not online now
May he is busy
22/1/24, 5:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @263771236809! May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation today?
22/1/24, 6:38 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Hie how are you
 Yes we can proceed
22/1/24, 10:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Since at the time you replied when our operational hours were over again, I noticed that we were not able to have a fruitful discussion with you for the past few sessions. May  I know if you are facing any challenges in attending the sessions at the scheduled times? It will help us to understand your concern and align ourselves better accordingly. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 5:31 AM - +27 78 568 0891: The main problem with me is that I'll be working so it's really hard to be able to attend to the sessions especially during the day .
23/1/24, 7:15 AM - +27 78 568 0891: Today I'm available we can go ahead with the session
23/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your situation @27785680891! Since you are available today, we will have our session at 4:00 PM to take forward our conversation.
23/1/24, 1:05 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Ok no problem thank you very much
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +27 78 568 0891: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 4:14 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Good afternoon sir. Can we go ahead with the session
23/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @27785680891! I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you are ready to take forward our conversation.
23/1/24, 4:18 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes I'm ready
23/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Picking up from our last conversation, With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
23/1/24, 4:19 PM - +27 78 568 0891: Yes it is
23/1/24, 4:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well.
23/1/24, 4:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - +27 78 568 0891: It's understood thanks
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: So may I know if you have any queries regarding this plan
23/1/24, 4:28 PM - +27 78 568 0891: I got no queries it's a perfect plan for us
23/1/24, 4:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now moving forward, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month. 


Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month?
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - +27 78 568 0891: I can start end of February and I'll be depositing the money end of each month thereafter
23/1/24, 9:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
23/1/24, 9:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: To proceed with the next steps, we will be sharing an official agreement detailing the specifics of the Financial Secure Plan along with its benefits. This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program. It serves as a legal framework ensuring transparency and mutual understanding between all parties involved.
23/1/24, 9:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]


2. Residential Address of the aforementioned representative.
23/1/24, 9:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Providing accurate and up-to-date information is essential to ensure the seamless processing of your enrollment in the Financial Secure Plan. Once we receive these details, we will quickly ask the team to share the agreement with you for your review and signature.
23/1/24, 9:36 PM - +27 78 568 0891: As we prepare to send you the agreement, we kindly request the following details to personalize the document:

1. Full Name of Parent/Guardian/Sponsor responsible for catering to the student's finances [The representative in whose name you want the agreement to be]
