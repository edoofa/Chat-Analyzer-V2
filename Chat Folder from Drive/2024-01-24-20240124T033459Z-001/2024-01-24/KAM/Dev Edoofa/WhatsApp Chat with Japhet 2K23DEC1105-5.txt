I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Mr. Dev Kumar, an Admission Officer at Edoofa. Alongside Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa, I am thrilled to be a part of your university admission journey.

Now that you've successfully completed your enrollment formalities, the commencement of your admission journey is scheduled for January 8th, 2024, starting at 1:30 PM CAT. To ensure a productive discussion, please ensure a smooth internet connection for the session.
5/1/24, 9:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this one-hour session, I, as your dedicated admission officer, will connect with you to explore your academic journey, understand your experiences, and gather essential information for your scholarship application. I'll also discuss your daily availability for future sessions. Count on me to guide you through the initial steps and address any queries you may have.

5/1/24, 9:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's crucial to print out these forms before our reconnection on January 8th, as the next batch for the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled for 12th January.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Japhet!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

18/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is my pleasure to interact with you @263778547012!
18/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Yes we can
18/1/24, 12:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 854 7012: You can explain
18/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Indeed clear
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Following
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 71 943 5579: Indeed, the steps are clear. What may need to be clearer is the level of involvement of gurdians/family in the processes.
18/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 943 5579: Another quick question is on the registration fees. Seems a bit high. Is it the standard or it goes with the conditions of the scholarship
18/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern @263719435579! But you must notice the fact that when applying for an international scholarship, the students must pay a fee much higher than this. But, Edoofa with its hard work and experience of 15 Years has been able to reduce the fee to this particular amount and has made it possible that this fee is eventually going to be part of your first year fee. 
Edoofa has also designed plans to assist students and their guardians in preparing their financials, which you will soon get to know about in further sessions.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, engaging in a detailed discussion at this stage may leave you unprepared to comprehend the upcoming steps. Therefore, I encourage you to hold onto any queries you have and follow through with the ongoing discussion, as this is a crucial part of your journey.

I hope you are doing well. I have been noticing for the past few sessions that we are not able to have fruitful conversations about  Japhet's admission journey. May I know if you are facing any challenges in attending these sessions? It will help us to understand your concerns and align ourselves accordingly.
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 854 7012: Thank you 
Yes they are challenges beyond our control so l was thinking that how about you schedule your sessions to 19:30PM were everyone will be active after work.
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your available times. But, however, you need to understand that my operational hours are from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM CAT. You also need to understand that 7:30 PM in Zimbabwe is 11:30 PM in India. So, it will not be possible for me to take forward our session at that time. So may I know, if you are going to be available between our operational hours? <This message was edited>
