If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
22/1/24, 5:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope these steps are clear to you?
22/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Very clear
22/1/24, 9:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since our operational hours were over at the time you replied, I was not able to take forward the conversation, we will take forward our conversation at 12:30 PM tomorrow. Till then I wish you a blessed night!

23/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps of the admission journey, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
23/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 263 2746: Is what we doing all along amongst the 6 stages???
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please ask you to elaborate on your query? I am not able to understand what you are trying to convey.
23/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 263 2746: The six stages you explained. Have we covered any stage or we are going to discuss more of them next sessions
23/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for elaborating on your query @263772632746. We will start with the first step in today's session.

23/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
23/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 263 2746: You can share
