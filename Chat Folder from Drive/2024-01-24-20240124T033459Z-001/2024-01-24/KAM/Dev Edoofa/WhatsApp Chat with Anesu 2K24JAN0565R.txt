For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm ready sir
18/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Alright sir
18/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I've read it may you go ahead
18/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes they are very clear
18/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 12:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm following
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Very clear sir
18/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I just wanted to ask ask approximately when would the registration fees due for payment
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is to be noted that the registration fee is to be paid after you receive the offer letters. Also currently, our focus is to help you understand the steps you will be taking in your admission journey. As we progress, we will guide you on how university admissions work and how you can select the best one for your higher education.
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, engaging in a detailed discussion at this stage may leave you unprepared to comprehend the upcoming steps. Therefore, I encourage you to hold onto any queries you have and follow through with the ongoing discussion, as this is a crucial part of your journey. Once we complete our sessions regarding the next steps, then we will be in a position to discuss such queries I hope you are able to resonate with this perspective, and with that in mind, we can proceed further with our sessions?
18/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Noted
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Ailght sir
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Alright
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 234 8678: Yes sir
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 234 8678: I'm ready
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

18/1/24, 1:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

19/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process.
19/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with these instructions?
19/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Good day to you sir
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 983 6130: I wanted to ask when is the above task due
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 983 6130: I am currently at school
19/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 71 983 6130: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 983 6130: Question 2.
Rights refer to the legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement. They are inherent to all human beings and are protected by law. Rights can be categorized into different types such as civil rights, human rights, and legal rights.

Duties, on the other hand, are the moral or legal obligations that individuals are required to fulfill. These obligations are generally imposed by law, ethics, or custom.

The differences between rights and duties are as follows:

1. Nature: Rights are entitlements that individuals possess by virtue of being human, while duties are obligations that individuals are required to fulfill.
2. Focus: Rights focus on the freedom and entitlement of individuals, while duties focus on the responsibilities and obligations of individuals towards others or society.

Human rights are inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. They are protected by international law and include rights such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person.

Civil rights, on the other hand, are rights that are granted to individuals within a specific society or country. They are often related to political and social freedom, and examples include the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, and the right to freedom of expression.

Question 3. 
An attorney is a person who is licensed to practice law and represent clients in legal matters. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, family law, or corporate law. They provide legal advice, prepare legal documents, and represent their clients in court.

A prosecutor, on the other hand, is a type of attorney who represents the government in criminal cases. Prosecutors are responsible for presenting the case against the defendant in court, gathering evidence, examining witnesses, and seeking justice on behalf of the state or government.

The main differences between a prosecutor and an attorney are as follows:

1. Representation: Attorneys represent individual clients, either plaintiffs or defendants, in legal matters. Prosecutors, however, represent the state or government in criminal cases and are responsible for pursuing criminal charges against defendants.

2. Objective: Attorneys generally work to protect the rights and interests of their clients, whether they are individuals, organizations, or businesses. Prosecutors, on the other hand, work to uphold the law and seek justice by representing the government in criminal cases.

3. Role in Court: Attorneys can act as defense lawyers, representing defendants in criminal cases, or as plaintiffs' lawyers, representing individuals or organizations bringing a legal claim. Prosecutors exclusively handle criminal cases and present the state's case against defendants.

Question 4.
I am mostly interested in pursuing Corporate Branch of law 

This is because it allows me as an individual to understand the legal framework within which business operate. This includes governance, finance, and commercial transactions

I have my own personal ambition because, growing up, I witnessed firsthand the injustices and inequalities that many people faced within our legal system. Whether it was due to financial constraints, lack of representation, or societal marginalization, I saw individuals and communities struggling to have their voices heard and their rights upheld, ispecially in businesses operations. 

These experiences fueled my determination to pursue a career in law. I was driven by the belief that everyone deserves equal access to justice and that the law should be a tool for empowerment and positive change. 

This will also give me an upper hand in becoming independent by establishing a law firm. I will also have the ability to give good legal advices ,protect the interest of stakeholders and have the ability to make informed business decisions
   


The above are  the reasons why i would like and justify my interest in studying Corporate law

 Question 5.
I believe, I obtain the following skills which will make me a successful lawyer in the future 

1. I have good research skills.
For example i intend to excel in  most  of the assignments that are handed to me that require research

2. I have good communication skills. I easily interact with people and communicate in a good manner. Most of my conversation with people are positive and productive

3. I am a critical thinker and analyser. Based on  the subject im currently doing for my A Level which are History, Sociology and Biblical studies are Arts subject which require a lot of deep thinking and deep analysis. 

4. I am a good problem solver. This is well justified as i was selected as one of the senior  prefects at first choice private school. This also shows that i have good leadership skills

 In summation I am a person who contains emotional intelligence and empathy and a good timer manager. With the above skills i believe they will make me a successful lawyer.
