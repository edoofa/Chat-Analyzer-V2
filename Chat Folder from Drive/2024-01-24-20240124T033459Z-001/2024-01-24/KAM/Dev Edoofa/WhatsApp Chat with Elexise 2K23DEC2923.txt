22/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Noted
22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes they are
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Yes l am
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 642 4175: They are clear my question is on Admission fee of 500 to 1000 maybe if you can clarify on the two figures
22/1/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263776424175! May I please ask you to please let us know what clarity you need on these two figures? It will help us to align you better accordingly.
22/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 642 4175: Maybe let me put it this way , what conditions will make the figure to be 500 or to be 1000  does it depends with the University the student would have been enrolled
 or
22/1/24, 1:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for making yourself clear, @263776424175! The registration fee totally depends on the university from which you have received the offer letter. I hope you are clear now?
22/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 642 4175: It's now clear thank you
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.
