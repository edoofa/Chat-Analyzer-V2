8/1/24, 4:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 4:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 849 4335: Greetings. Thank you so much for the thoughtful gesture. Compliments of the new year 🎊. We are well as a family.
9/1/24, 5:35 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263788494335. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

In light of the same, may I ask what changes or additions have you decided to make in the year 2024 for you and your family?
9/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 78 849 4335: Hello dear. Thank you for your concern. Since it's just the beginning of the year..we are still trying to make ends meet financially. Hoping to seeing positive change this year.

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

22/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 114 7529: Greetings to you Mr Sahil..I am well
I recall everything we discussed before
22/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 114 7529: Compliments of the new year to you all😊🙏

I acknowledge with pleasure receipt of your communication and am really pleased to note your interest in your endeavors to see me excel in my chosen career with your institution.

I am really touched to have failed to join others as initially were my plans.
 In that regard will you kindly accept my financial plight at this stage because as a family we are stretched as the economy this side has been under-perfoming to incredible levels.
As such as a family we were almost about to approach your administration and maybe with your assistance if at this stage that a reimbursement of that which I had initially effected of U$380 as payment be refunded to remedy our current situation.

We really appreciate the level of professionalism which your university and especially yourself expressed during the enrollment exercise.

May you kindly accept my intimacy in communicating with my family on this latest development and pray your cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

May you remain blessed and hoping to receiving from yourselves at the earliest opportunity🙏
23/1/24, 9:03 AM - Sahil Edoofa: Setting aside enrollment concerns, I want to understand, on a personal level as your friend, your future career plans. Given the financial challenges most families encounter, I'm interested in knowing your broader vision for supporting your family in the long run. Success in your endeavors would not only benefit you but also serve as a crucial factor in improving your family's financial situation. Otherwise, there might be a more significant financial setback for your family in the next five years.
23/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 78 114 7529: Greetings once more to you Mr Sahil.

I realize your concern and to a greater extent concur to what could be best for my career like you are sharing in your correspondence.

I feel your institution will definitely be of material in future as my family is making frantic efforts to rationalize our financial ability to meet our day to day domestic needs. Surely without much elaboration the position of our economy still remains undoubtedly a cause for urgent attention hence the plight we are sunk in at the moment.

You are aware we fell at  the last hurdle financially and still need to recover as a family.
Will you kindly accept this position and assist with all within your limits in expediting release of the US$380-00 which to some better extent remedy our situation.

We will continue to constantly get in touch with your institution and when need arises which might not be very long from now.

Thanking in advance for your your cooperation and assistance in this matter.
23/1/24, 8:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:15 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 114 7529: Thank you🙏
