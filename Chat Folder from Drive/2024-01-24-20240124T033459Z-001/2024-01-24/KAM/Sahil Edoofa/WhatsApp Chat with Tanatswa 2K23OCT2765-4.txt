16/1/24, 8:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

However, this is not the case for you, as you have received a scholarship offer letter from MVN University, making you ineligible for a refund according to our policy.

While I am more than willing to explain this policy in detail, I am also concerned that we are here to help you out but you are not willing to change your mind here.
16/1/24, 8:30 PM - +27 62 556 9098: Oky please may you stipulate where we had an agreement on that .Because if you could have stated it i was not going to continue asking about it.I remember we had a conversation through  a video call and i had to ask him he told me that you will get a refund, so please  may i have my refund. Thank you.

17/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you understand the process better please. The enrollment fee you paid for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship program is refundable only if we fail to assist your child in securing a scholarship opportunity for their higher education in India. However, since you have already received a scholarship offer letter from MVN University, you are not eligible for a refund according to our policy. I hope that's clear, right ?
