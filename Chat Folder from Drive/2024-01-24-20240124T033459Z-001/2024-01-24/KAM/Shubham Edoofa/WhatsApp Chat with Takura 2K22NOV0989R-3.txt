6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takura,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 8:42 PM - +263 78 887 2725: ok thanks
10/1/24, 7:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

14/1/24, 8:28 PM - +263 78 887 2725: good day
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Takura!

I hope you are doing well today. I regret to inform you that I am currently unwell, and consequently, I am unable to conduct today's session. I hope this does not cause any inconvenience for you. We will have our session tomorrow at the same time. Until then, take care and have a blessed rest of the day!
15/1/24, 9:37 AM - +27 79 908 8320: Morning to u too, ok thanks hope you will be well soon
16/1/24, 3:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takura,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 9:07 PM - +263 78 887 2725: sorry for late reply
22/1/24, 10:05 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Good Day, Takura
*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. 
Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.
22/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 887 2725: good morning sir
22/1/24, 10:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Hello Takura, How were your results for the Advanced Levels?
22/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 887 2725: <Media omitted>

22/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 78 887 2725: ok
22/1/24, 11:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Yes Please Takura, you can still proceed with Law Please!
22/1/24, 11:28 AM - Shubham Edoofa: So Takura, I can see that earlier you went inactive for your sessions, Can you explain the reason for the same?
22/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 887 2725: my phone was dead,sorry sir i just repaired it some days ago
22/1/24, 11:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted, So are you and your parents ready to continue with your admissions process now?
22/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 887 2725: yes sir
22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa: So Takura, Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 887 2725: ok sir
22/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/1/24, 12:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 887 2725: yes its not possible
22/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 887 2725: ok sir
22/1/24, 12:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/1/24, 12:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/1/24, 12:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
22/1/24, 12:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 887 2725: yes sir we are in the same path
22/1/24, 12:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 887 2725: yes sir
22/1/24, 1:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

$2000 - $3000 Range: Reg $500 to $1000:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/1/24, 7:33 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/1/24, 8:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
23/1/24, 11:46 AM - +27 79 908 8320: Morning sir
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa: Good Morning Please,
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
23/1/24, 11:49 AM - +27 79 908 8320: No question sir
23/1/24, 1:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Please why did TAkura go Inactive during the session yesterday, I hope everything is okay?
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Everything is ok sir,he just caught up with something,even today
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted, So are you available on Takura's behalf?
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Yes
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?


*I hope  you are clear on the same?* <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 3:58 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Yes its clear
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, To reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/1/24, 4:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 4:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Got it
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
23/1/24, 4:17 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Ok
23/1/24, 4:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
23/1/24, 4:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/1/24, 4:24 PM - +27 79 908 8320: For now I don't have
23/1/24, 4:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Please note, The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 4:51 PM - +27 79 908 8320: Yes sir
23/1/24, 4:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa: @27799088320 I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call with your Parents?
23/1/24, 7:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
