8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - +260 96 6367513: Thank you very much.
8/1/24, 4:40 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome, @260966367513. How have you been doing? It has been a long while since we connected with each other. I am quite intrigued to know how you have been doing. How is everything back at your home, and what have you been up to in the past couple of months?
8/1/24, 4:51 PM - +260 96 6367513: Thank you very much, we have been fine. Esther was accepted at Copperbelt University and has been given 100% bursary we thank God, she is doing Bachelor Degree in Business Administration management and accounting.  We failed to proceed with the program we started with you due to financial difficulties. Thank you checking on us.
8/1/24, 4:56 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update, and congratulations to Esther on being accepted at Copperbelt University with a 100% bursary! That's truly a remarkable achievement, and we are delighted to hear about her pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration Management and Accounting.
8/1/24, 4:56 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your openness about the financial difficulties that led to a pause in the program we started together. Understanding your current situation, I am interested to know more about Esther's journey in education. When did she start her program at Copperbelt University, and how is her academic experience going so far?
8/1/24, 4:59 PM - +260 96 6367513: So she opened on 27th November 2023 did the registration for about a week had few sessions of classes, closed for 2weeks they reopened today 8th of January 2024. She said so far so good. They had some assignments during the holidays which they did. They are yet to have recess in some weeks time.
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @260966367513. While we were hoping to have her as part of the students pursuing her education abroad, we understand that there were situations beyond everyone's control that limited her ability to do so. 

However, this is indeed a significant achievement, and it's something we are proud of. We wish her all the best, and if in the future she changes her mind and wishes to pursue education in India, we will certainly be there to guide her with the same dream then.
9/1/24, 6:00 PM - +260 96 6367513: Thank you very much.

*I am Mr Shubham, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. 
Recalling our interaction after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today.
22/1/24, 10:11 AM - +260 96 6367513: Greetings Mr Shubham, thank you  texting. I am Esther's mother. We couldn't manage to go ahead  with the program due to the financial challenges being a single parent. But we thank God she got accepted at Copperbelt University on a 100% bursary. She is pursuing Bachelors degree in business administration and accounting. Thank you for checking on her.

Registration on 100% bursary we paid K2600, then she is on meal allowance, library allowance and lodging.
