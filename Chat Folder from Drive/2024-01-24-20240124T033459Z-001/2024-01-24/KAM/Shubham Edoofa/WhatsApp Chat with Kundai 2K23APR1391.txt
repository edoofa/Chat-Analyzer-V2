16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Good Afternoon ma'am,we are all well thank you.l hope you are aware that my guardian and parents would not be able to pay for my tertiary education abroad or locally.I will share my results with you anyway.

16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
16/1/24, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.

23/1/24, 12:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
23/1/24, 12:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?

23/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Thank you
23/1/24, 12:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
23/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 747 7769: That must be hard,l see Sir.
23/1/24, 1:37 PM - Shubham Edoofa: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Unfortunately l am not financially stable to come and study in India due to some unfortunate turn of events.l am also not capable to study in any local universities. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Kundai, I hope you understand that While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Well l don't believe that as of now the institutions are able prepare a student to be be employable
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - Shubham Edoofa: So, why do you want to pursue your education back in Zimbabwe?
23/1/24, 2:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Kundai, Before I contacted you I had a brief discussion about your application with Mr Sagar and Mr Piiyush, And from what I was able to understand after discussing with them was, the reason you wanted to apply for the Edoofa scholarship or to study abroad was to get Quality Higher Education that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future, isn't it?
23/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 747 7769: That is precise yes
23/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 747 7769: There has been some miscommunication there  Sir l do not wish to pursue it in Zimbabwe.My current situation  does not allow me to pursue my Tertiary education anywhere in the world right now.
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I understand please, So what are your plans ahead then?
23/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 747 7769: I was thinking of doing nursing
23/1/24, 3:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Can you further elaborate?
23/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Okay,l had applied for nursing in December but l did not get in so when the next advert is published l am going to apply to study nursing in Zimbabwe,it is convenient to as it is free of cost.Then acquire a diploma in nursing when l have acquired the same l am going either specialise in a specific nursing course or pay for university and further my studies by myself. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/
Kundai, as I shared with you the same earlier, Even the Diploma course cost for only the tuition fees will be around $500-$600 per semester, And with the examples your annual cost would range around $2000 itself
23/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Not at a university Mr.Shubham at a medical facility like a hospital ,there it is free of cost.You would be learning and applying what you learnt in the hospital to help the registered nurses.
23/1/24, 4:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I totally understand please
23/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 747 7769: Okay Sir.
23/1/24, 4:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Noted please
