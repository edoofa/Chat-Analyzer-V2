19/12/23, 9:41 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Osile,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - +27 61 282 2560: Helo everyone
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - +27 61 282 2560: Hope you are doing well
16/1/24, 4:06 PM - +27 61 282 2560: My apologies  i failed to raise Oslie's money amount of $750  .so i dont know what can i do
17/1/24, 9:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for asking, I am doing great. It is alright please, we will discuss that as well. However, may I know if you were able to go through the message above I shared yesterday?
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - +27 61 282 2560: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - +27 61 282 2560: I can understand  but the issue is i dont think i will manage the payments bwcause of the sitiation i have now .
17/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you must have been facing financial challenges as you expressed to me above. However, you know despite the challenges students are able to pursue their higher education abroad. And I personally had a discussion with Mr.Shubham your career counselor and he mentioned that he informed me that he remembered everything about Osile when you initially enrolled and that is why he personally showed interest in your application and wants to connect with you on Monday. See our goal is not only to provide you with a quality education but even understand the challenges you go through and then provide you with a solution to those challenges in particular. Being your admission officer I would suggest you connect with Mr. Shubham on Monday and share your concerns with him so that he can assist you.
