16/1/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Dephine,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 281 6743: Hello. How are you. Hope you are doing well. Compliments of the season.
Please find attached dephine results.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward.

23/1/24, 12:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Oh I had no idea
23/1/24, 2:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 2:55 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
23/1/24, 2:56 PM - Shubham Edoofa: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 2:59 PM - +27 73 417 1131: The fee are really affordable
23/1/24, 3:04 PM - +27 73 417 1131: We have not yet come up with the final decision but we have decided to apply both abroad and in local schools. But I want to pursue my education abroad at affordable schools.but if the prices are too high I will go to universities this side
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Dephine, Let me help you understand the same in much more detail
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa: While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
23/1/24, 3:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
23/1/24, 6:56 PM - +27 73 417 1131: I don't think so
23/1/24, 7:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/1/24, 7:28 PM - +27 73 417 1131: Okay sir
