This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

6/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 709 8241: I greatly appreciate your help ,may you be successful in  all your life endeavors
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Believe,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you
8/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Congratulations 🎊,
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, Believe.
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 709 8241: It is a wonderful opportunity meeting you, and having you assist me in partaking this academic journey, I'm so much honored knowing you are here to guide me accordingly. 

I stand firm with my goals and have my eyes set on my university education.
8/1/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Due to the October examinations I could not handle both the examination pressure and processes online, hence I took a break from my social media platforms. Now as I await the announcement of my results, I decided to continue with the admission process
9/1/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.

May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
9/1/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Wonderful greetings to you
9/1/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes I believe now is the perfect time to proceed with the admission process
9/1/24, 9:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward in order to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your higher education.

According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes surely
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 709 8241: May you kindly walk me through the costs once more
9/1/24, 10:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, dear. 

*To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.*
9/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Hence ,I have to apply for university first, isn't it, then after acceptance from the university and I've been given the program I want to be studying,then follows registration, is it the correct understanding I have?
9/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 709 8241: On that note , I would also appreciate it if you share with me the tuition fees for different universities offering my program
9/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 709 8241: I believe this information is accompanied by accommodation and cost of living.
9/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, your understanding of the same is correct.
9/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case we would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, and after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
9/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now every parent has a question that why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University.

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
9/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
9/1/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The range of $2000 - $3000 includes the following - annual tuition fee, accommodation, food, and any other university aspects.
12/1/24, 7:46 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted
12/1/24, 7:49 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted
12/1/24, 7:50 AM - +263 77 709 8241: Understood
13/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear. As my operational hours for the day our coming to an end soon, I would like to schedule our session at 8:30 AM for Monday. I hope that timing is suitable for you?
13/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted
13/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. Until then, take care and have a blessed rest of the day!
13/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 709 8241: You too 🙏
16/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Believe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Well noted

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.

Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
