As per our recent conversation, your fees were extended till the 28th of Nov. meaning that the second payment falls after a month that is 28th Dec. Hence I would like to let you know that since we are approaching the month's end may I know if you might be able to share an update with me regarding the payment. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. I do not want this delay to affect your scholarship. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment if not made the payment yet? Will you be able to make it by 5:00 PM tomorrow?

16/1/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Elizabeth,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 594 6301: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Okay
22/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 502 8391: Hello how are you

This is Ms. Vilsha, I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We are doing well, thank you for asking. I hope you too are keeping well? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 502 8391: Has been too long before any communication so was worried
23/1/24, 2:43 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed @263775028391, it has been a while since we last connected. However, if I remember correctly, Ms. Siddhi from our team reached out to you to inquire about your results. She mentioned that once the results evaluation is completed, the team will reconnect with you for further procedures. I hope you recall the same update shared with you on Wednesday?
23/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 502 8391: What's the further  procedures as of now
23/1/24, 3:09 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: @263775028391, as of now, the team is reviewing the results of all the students, including yours. They are adding them to your scholarship application file. 

Since there are over a thousand Edoofians who have received their results, the team will take some time to review the results. Once the result evaluation is completed, the team will reconnect with you and guide you through the procedures to complete your remaining admission formalities. They will help you secure your admission acceptance letter and then commence the visa application process.

In the meantime, all you have to do is exercise patience and focus on your EWYL Program so that you can get the maximum benefits from the program and are preparing for your future by being on the right track.
