28/12/23, 9:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Malcolm. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As per the recent conversation that you had with Mr. Milan, it has been noted that you were supposed to make the payment of $200 each month. Hence, I want to take an update on you if you were able to make the payment for this month as we have already exceeded the deadline. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. I do not want this delay to affect your scholarship. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment if not made the payment yet? Will you be able to make it by 5:00 PM tomorrow?
29/12/23, 10:22 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Morning

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
