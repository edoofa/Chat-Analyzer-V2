The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

113 - 23 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*  *STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them- *STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
114 - 23 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.  The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_.

115 - 23 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination). Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)",No,Yes

139 - 23 Jan 2024 08:53AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:* *Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.  *Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.  *Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
140 - 23 Jan 2024 08:53AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:  *Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).  *Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.  *Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.  *Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).  *Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
141 - 23 Jan 2024 08:53AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:  You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.",No,Yes

13 - 23 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14 - 23 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:* *Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.  *Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.  *Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
15 - 23 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:  *Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).  *Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.  *Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.  *Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).  *Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
16 - 23 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:  You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

19 - 23 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20 - 23 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

24 - 23 Jan 2024 02:18PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

16 - 23 Jan 2024 03:38PM - +263 71 933 0584: Mostly from the ewyl program i expect to gain more knowledge and experience on how to handle issues regarding life problems such as social interaction and use of social media to market Even though i have been facing challenges i can gladly say i have been learning a lot Especially from the Wednesday wisdom lessons The main issue is the issue of trust from my community so as to hinder this i would love if you guys organized even a seminar for a day or two this side in Bulawayo where i can invite parents to come and listen to you explain about the program and gain their trust because i face challenges where parents say they cannot deal with people they have never met before
18 - 23 Jan 2024 03:50PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope you understand that your success would only be possible if you show up to working on your aspirations every single day and (in narrower focus) also towards making your contributions towards your EWYL program regularly. Contributions can be of any scale - big or small. However, they should always result into learnings. You can obtain those learning from your sessions with your mentor, projects, wednesday lessons, etc. I hope that you make¬†the¬†most¬†of¬†it.

193 - 23 Jan 2024 09:54AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

147 - 23 Jan 2024 05:48AM - +263 77 409 1814: Good morning Ashi. My situation is complicated. I am failing to raise the money for the first instalment of 350 why because I am sending other kids to school. Beside Hilda there is Henry doing upper 6 and needs fees of 800 us per term plus a examination fees due soon of about $200 usd. In addition to that there's Hilda's young sister doing O level paying fees of $300  per term and require an examination fees of $200usd that's is between now and February. Which means I will run around to find those monies and if I borrow it means I have March to payback and find fees for second term for the two which is more than $1000. There other issue which have hindered our plans is that Hilda's contract was terminated at the end of December and she can not help raise money for her education as we had planned. I wish i had other means but am hitting hard times.

51 - 23 Jan 2024 03:39PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.  1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.

Suppose there are 100 scholarship seats that Caabilo wants to enroll in, and only 5 seats are remaining. With the scholarship seats getting occupied, the probability of securing a seat is decreasing as we proceed towards the end of January. There is a high chance that if you delay the process until February, there will be no scholarship seats remaining. So, instead of delaying the admission process until February, if you make the right decision of completing the admission process now, as Caabilo's admission officer, I will ensure that Caabilo secures a scholarship seat at the best university for his higher education here in India. I hope we are on the same page regarding this?

I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.  As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
19 - 16 Jan 2024 08:09PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.  For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

194 - 23 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Austin Edoofa: Technology and biotechnology are interconnected fields that often complement each other rather than replace each other. While advancements in technology can enhance various aspects of biotechnology, it's unlikely to completely replace biotechnology career opportunities. Instead, technology can create new opportunities, streamline processes, and contribute to the growth of the biotechnology industry.  Here are a few reasons why technology is more likely to complement biotechnology rather than replace it:  Tool Development: Technology plays a crucial role in developing advanced tools and equipment used in biotechnology research and applications. These tools, such as gene editing technologies, high-throughput screening methods, and bioinformatics tools, are essential for biotechnologists to conduct their work effectively.  Data Analysis: With the increasing complexity of biological data, technology is vital for handling and analyzing large datasets generated in biotechnological research. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics in biotechnology enhances our ability to extract meaningful insights from biological information.  Automation: Technological advancements have led to increased automation in biotechnology processes. Automated systems can perform repetitive tasks more efficiently, allowing biotechnologists to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.  Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: The convergence of technology and biotechnology has led to interdisciplinary collaborations, creating opportunities for professionals with expertise in both fields. Individuals who understand both the biological and technological aspects are well-positioned to contribute to cutting-edge research and development.  Innovation and Discovery: Technology fosters innovation, enabling the development of new techniques and methodologies in biotechnology. For example, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology, emerged from the intersection of molecular biology and technology.

194 - 23 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Austin Edoofa: Technology and biotechnology are interconnected fields that often complement each other rather than replace each other. While advancements in technology can enhance various aspects of biotechnology, it's unlikely to completely replace biotechnology career opportunities. Instead, technology can create new opportunities, streamline processes, and contribute to the growth of the biotechnology industry.  Here are a few reasons why technology is more likely to complement biotechnology rather than replace it:  Tool Development: Technology plays a crucial role in developing advanced tools and equipment used in biotechnology research and applications. These tools, such as gene editing technologies, high-throughput screening methods, and bioinformatics tools, are essential for biotechnologists to conduct their work effectively.  Data Analysis: With the increasing complexity of biological data, technology is vital for handling and analyzing large datasets generated in biotechnological research. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics in biotechnology enhances our ability to extract meaningful insights from biological information.  Automation: Technological advancements have led to increased automation in biotechnology processes. Automated systems can perform repetitive tasks more efficiently, allowing biotechnologists to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.  Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: The convergence of technology and biotechnology has led to interdisciplinary collaborations, creating opportunities for professionals with expertise in both fields. Individuals who understand both the biological and technological aspects are well-positioned to contribute to cutting-edge research and development.  Innovation and Discovery: Technology fosters innovation, enabling the development of new techniques and methodologies in biotechnology. For example, CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology, emerged from the intersection of molecular biology and technology.
195 - 23 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Austin Edoofa: While technology enhances the capabilities of biotechnologists, it does not replace the need for biological expertise. Biotechnology careers encompass a broad range of disciplines, including molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology, which require specialized knowledge and skills.

91 - 23 Jan 2024 02:31PM - Austin Edoofa: ,*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

47 - 23 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Austin Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
48 - 23 Jan 2024 04:33PM - +263 78 847 1404: Indeed it is accurate Mr Austin
49 - 23 Jan 2024 04:47PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?

52 - 23 Jan 2024 04:55PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes I do remember but in the last two months I had a change to my whatsapp so if you may kindly share the registration fee with that would be appreciated
53 - 23 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Austin Edoofa: In that case, Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
54 - 23 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
55 - 23 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
56 - 23 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?
57 - 23 Jan 2024 05:20PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes nderstood very well
65 - 23 Jan 2024 05:32PM - +27 83 470 2027: Is accomodation available in the mid semester breaks
66 - 23 Jan 2024 05:39PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome!
67 - 23 Jan 2024 05:39PM - Austin Edoofa: That is right
68 - 23 Jan 2024 05:39PM - Austin Edoofa: Yes, students can continue at their Accommodation during breaks or can visit home.
69 - 23 Jan 2024 06:14PM - +263 78 847 1404: Well noted
70 - 23 Jan 2024 06:53PM - Austin Edoofa: Alright Tanatswa, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for you to study in India under the given Scholarship.

251 - 23 Jan 2024 03:55PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
252 - 23 Jan 2024 03:55PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
253 - 23 Jan 2024 04:00PM - +263 71 433 2297: May you elaborate a bit

256 - 23 Jan 2024 04:46PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. The parents have to deposit $150 per month for the next 10 months so that at the end of 10 months you will save $1500. Now after saving this $1500 for 10 months, Edoofa will waive off the remaining fee of $150 that is left to pay from your side.

279 - 23 Jan 2024 10:58AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries @263773775772! I was not able to respond as our operational hours were over yesterday. Let me clear up your queries:  1. It is absolutely fine if you do not want to engage with this plan, but you must understand that the Edoofa Secure Plan helps families prepare for the finances of their students most conveniently and ensures that students after enrolling in the Edoofa Secure Plan, are not facing problems in managing the finances at the time of coming to India. 2. For this, I understand your concern, and where you are coming from. If I was in your position, I would have had the same concern. After counseling thousands of students over the years, I have a small question. Why do you think such a situation can arise, as you are surely going to be saving some amount for Ashley's higher education in India, right?
280 - 23 Jan 2024 11:40AM - +263 71 745 9650: I think that this question arose because a lot of students were facing financial problems when it was time to come to India .

283 - 23 Jan 2024 04:42PM - Dev Edoofa: We are aware that most students face such kind of situation. But it is to be noted that they face such situations due to improper preparation of finances. That is why the Edoofa Financial Plan is designed in such a way that students are able to prepare well fro their finances. I hope you are able to understand what I am trying to convey.

134 - 23 Jan 2024 01:46PM - +263 71 132 2777: Well in the third video i was really touched by the issue of the student who lost 1300 to some thieves Well indeed there are others who are doing than cause they know that students in africa are desperate for better education then they use that to their own advantage So thats why i want to thank you administrators for your out standing job in assuring us the students on how we can rely on edoofa Well it also talked about edoofa not only being a program that provides admissions in schools but creates a carrier opportunity to students It also stated about having a huge vision of opportunities and not to be just based on one but to be open minded and in my own words learn to be led to the brighter future
135 - 23 Jan 2024 02:00PM - +263 71 132 2777: And now the last video this one was amaizing I was really inspired by the 5th grader who was able to challange the status because the child saw an opportunity and decided to go for it despite the odds and that is really amazing because that is being open-minded and allowing yourself to be tought This whole dialogue tought me to just following instructions and allow my superiors to teach me into the right pathway of success and achievements That was wonderful

Since she is going to be unavailable, I believe parents/guardians can actively participate in the EWYL sessions to make sure that she is not missing out on the scholarship credits that she will earn from these sessions.

342 - 22 Jan 2024 09:36PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Now, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month.  Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month?
343 - 22 Jan 2024 10:16PM - +263 77 382 1026: Its ok Sir, I have school fees and exam fees February and March lets start in April 28 going forward every month 28 or 29 if the 28 th falls on a Sunday. Let me hear your thoughts thanks.
344 - 23 Jan 2024 12:15PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773821026! I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know about your comfortable dates, but @263773821026 at the time the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is not going to be valid as this plan ensures that the parents or guardians can start preparing at the start of this plan and eventually save the amount accordingly. But if you start around the end of April, you may not have sufficient savings for the finances of Leah's higher education. This will eventually become a roadblock in Eutacia's admission journey. I hope you understand my concern? <This message was edited>

So may I please ask you to send me a breakup of the finances, starting from April to November, how much money you will deposit every month so that you can save $1500 at the end of November? It will help us to get clarity on your plan of preparation and prepare for further timelines as well. <This message was edited>

170 - 23 Jan 2024 02:53PM - +263 71 439 7817: Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to provide nutrients and support plant growth. It is determined by the presence and availability of essential nutrients, organic matter content, pH level, and overall soil structure.  There are several methods to check soil fertility, including:  1. Soil testing: This involves collecting soil samples from different areas of a field and analyzing them in a laboratory. Soil tests measure nutrient levels (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), pH, organic matter content, and other parameters.  2. Visual assessment: Farmers and agronomists can visually assess soil fertility based on plant health, growth patterns, and nutrient deficiencies or excesses. However, this method is subjective and may not provide precise measurements.  To improve soil fertility, various practices can be implemented, such as:  1. Adding organic matter: Incorporating organic materials like compost, manure, cover crops, or crop residues into the soil enhances nutrient content, improves soil structure, and promotes microbial activity.  2. Appropriate nutrient management: Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances can limit soil fertility. Adding fertilizers or soil amendments based on soil test results helps replenish nutrient levels and maintain a balanced nutrient ratio.  3. Crop rotation and diversification: Growing different crops in a rotation system helps break pest and disease cycles, enhances nutrient cycling, and increases organic matter content.  4. Conservation tillage: Reducing or eliminating tillage minimizes soil erosion, preserves soil structure, and protects soil organic matter.  5. Avoiding overuse of agrochemicals: Excessive use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides can negatively impact soil fertility and harm beneficial soil organisms. Practicing precision agriculture techniques optimizes the use of inputs based on actual crop needs.  6. Water management: Proper irrigation practices prevent soil erosion and leaching of nutrients. Conserving water resources and utilizing efficient irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation, can improve soil fertility.  It is important to note that soil fertility improvement is a continuous process, and long-term sustainable practices should be adopted to maintain and enhance soil health.
171 - 23 Jan 2024 02:53PM - +263 71 439 7817: Technology can provide significant assistance to farmers in numerous ways. Here are some examples:  1. Precision Farming: Precision farming technologies, such as GPS, drones, and remote sensing, enable farmers to gather accurate data about their fields. This information helps farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application, resulting in reduced costs, improved yields, and minimized environmental impacts.  2. Agricultural Machinery: Modern farming equipment, including tractors, combine harvesters, and seeders, have been technologically advanced. These machines enhance efficiency and productivity by automating various tasks, reducing labor requirements, and increasing overall farm output.  3. Crop Monitoring and Management: Sensors and remote monitoring systems can track soil moisture levels, temperature, and nutrient content. This data allows farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and planting times, thereby maximizing crop health and yields.  4. Improved Plant Breeding: Biotechnology and genetic engineering aid in developing crop varieties with enhanced traits like disease resistance, drought tolerance, and higher yield potential. These advancements in genetics help farmers cultivate more robust and productive crops.  5. Weather Forecasting: Accurate weather forecasting systems assist farmers in planning their activities, such as planting, harvesting, and spraying, based on upcoming weather conditions. This knowledge helps optimize resource allocation and minimize potential risks associated with adverse weather events.  6. Data Analytics and Farm Management Software: Digital tools and farm management software enable farmers to collect and analyze data to make informed decisions. These technologies can track inventory, manage finances, plan operations, and optimize resource allocation, enhancing overall farm efficiency and profitability.  7. Market Access and E-commerce: Online platforms and marketplaces facilitate direct sales of agricultural products, connecting farmers directly with consumers and eliminating intermediaries. This technology provides farmers with greater market access, fairer pricing, and increased opportunities for income generation.  8. Sustainable Practices: Technology can support sustainable agriculture by reducing resource use and environmental impacts. For instance, robotic systems can precisely weed or pick fruits, reducing the need for herbicides and manual labor. Additionally, technologies for efficient water management, renewable energy, and waste management promote sustainability on farms.  By harnessing the power of technology, farmers can optimize their operations, increase productivity, reduce costs, make informed decisions, and contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices.
172 - 23 Jan 2024 02:53PM - +263 71 439 7817: There are a variety of farming systems, but the most common are conventional farming, organic farming, and sustainable farming. Conventional farming is the most common type of farming system. It involves the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals to maximize crop yields. Organic farming is a system that avoids the use of synthetic chemicals and instead relies on natural methods to control pests and fertilize crops. Sustainable farming is similar to organic farming, but it also focuses on conserving resources and protecting the environment. All three systems have their benefits and drawbacks, and the choice of which system to use depends on the specific needs of A major benefit of conventional farming is that it can produce high yields of crops, which is important to feed a growing population. However, it can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute water and soil, and they can also harm wildlife. Organic farming can help to reduce environmental impacts, but it can be more difficult to achieve high yields. Sustainable farming aims to strike a balance between productivity and environmental protection, but it can be more costly and time-consuming. Ultimately, the choice of which farming system to use comes down to a number of factors, including the farmer's goals, the location Another important consideration is the type of crops being grown. For example, some crops, such as tomatoes, require a high level of care and management to produce a good yield. Therefore, a conventional system may be more appropriate for tomatoes, while sustainable or organic systems may be better suited for other crops. Additionally, the location of the farm can also play a role in determining which system is best. For example, farms in areas with a lot of rainfall may be better suited for organic farming, while farms in arid regions may be better suited for conventional.
173 - 23 Jan 2024 02:53PM - +263 71 439 7817: Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests, such as insects, weeds, and fungi. There are many different types of pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides. Herbicides are used to kill weeds, while insecticides are used to kill insects. Fungicides are used to control fungi, and rodenticides are used to control rodents. Pesticides can be applied in a variety of ways, including spraying, dusting, and baiting. While pesticides can be effective at controlling pests, they can also pose risks to human health and the environment. Exposure to pesticides can cause a range of health problems, including skin irritation, respiratory problems, and cancer. Pesticides can also harm wildlife and contaminate water supplies. To reduce the risks of pesticides, many farmers are now using integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. IPM is an approach that uses a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods to control pests in a way that is effective and also minimizes the risks to human health and the environment. IPM is an important part of sustainable farming systems. Overall, pesticides are a complex and controversial issue, and it is important to understand the risks and benefits of their use.

184 - 23 Jan 2024 01:28PM - +263 78 164 7225: 2, Rights are the basic entitlements a citizen should have, simply by being born. There are many types of rights which are meant to protect a citizen at any stage of their life. Meanwhile Duties are what individuals are obligated to do as law abiding citizens towards others, society and the government. Duties are required to maintain order and justice in the society. Examples of duties include obeying laws, paying taxes and so on.  Human Rights are the base or core of rights of human beings. They are the right to live, the right to education, protection from torture, freedom of expression and fair trial. They are the necessities of the human existence. These rights are the starting point to a civilised and functioning society.  Civil Rights are the ones entitled to a citizen in a particular nation. They protect a citizen from discrimination such as discrimination based on race, sex, culture and other characteristics. Civil Rights also give them certain freedoms, for example, Freedom of speech, equal protection, freedom of religion and so on. These rights may differ from country to country. Civil rights stand as an agreement between the nation and the citizen in it. <This message was edited>
185 - 23 Jan 2024 01:30PM - +263 78 164 7225: 3, A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their role is in the presentation of evidence against certain individuals accused of committing a crime. They seek justice on behalf of the government to prove guilt of the accused individual beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors are employed by the government. They can also be referred to as district attorneys.  However, an attorney is also a legal professional and provides legal advice and represents clients in legal matters that range from criminal matters to corporate matters. They can work with individuals, businesses, or organizations either in criminal and civil cases. Attorneys can specialize in criminal law, family law, corporate law or immigration law. Attorneys have the option to own their own practice or work for an already existing law firm. In the courtroom or during a case they work hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt for their client‚Äôs innocence. This is where the difference between an attorney and the prosecutor lie. <This message was edited>
186 - 23 Jan 2024 01:30PM - +263 78 164 7225: 4, I‚Äôm mostly interested in corporate law. Corporate law is the perfect combination of law and business, which are my two key interests. I feel by being a corporate lawyer I get the opportunity of enjoying both worlds. Being a corporate lawyer means I can practice my passion for law while exploring the vast business world. For me exposure to big businesses will be the highlight of my career. I will love the traveling and sitting in business meetings while getting the in-depth understanding of business practices, documents and regulations. As a corporate lawyer I will have an opportunity to manage several projects simultaneously. Corporate lawyers rarely attend court. I would rather spend a lot of time in the office and taking part in meetings, writing legal documents, advising executives, and negotiating contracts. I believe the job of a corporate lawyer is diverse so I will need to study various fields such as criminal law, risk, merger, and tax. I believe by becoming a successful corporate lawyer my long term goals will broaden. Corporate law is also one of the most lucrative professions which makes my dream of independence come true. <This message was edited>
187 - 23 Jan 2024 01:31PM - +263 78 164 7225: 5, From a young age public speaking was always a skill I needed and used. From addressing the school as Head Girl to improvising a disquisition as Junior Member of Parliament, this will be just one of my skills that I apply in the courtroom. An additional skill is one I learnt from experience. Leaving one country to settle in another taught me how to be adaptable and it also taught me how to use good judgement in new situations. I had to learn to be adaptable to the new cultures of the people around me. My organisational skills are evident in my school work. I believe organisation works hand in hand with attention to detail. I make sure everything I do is done to the best of my ability, and a bit more. As an aspiring lawyer it is imperative that my communication skills ‚Äì especially with individuals ‚Äì  are the best they can be. It is important to be able to communicate with people from all walks of life. I grew up exposed to many cultures and with many people with different backgrounds, which taught me a lot about understanding people. <This message was edited>

318 - 22 Jan 2024 05:10PM - +263 77 388 8622: Yes yes sir we had a lengthy discussion. We agreed that since our salaries are too far below poverty data line. We are getting too little in our salaries, so we have decided to kindly allow us to pay at least $30 per month so that we will be able to look for the family with the balances that we will have remained with. We had high hopes that our son might be lucky and get the full scholarship so that we will be relieved on fees. If you can allow us to sacrifice the amount l have mentioned above we will be very glad.
319 - 22 Jan 2024 07:13PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern @263773888622. But now that you know the universities that we have tie-ups with offer quality high education to its students. So, for that, they have hefty fees of around $6000-$8000 which the students have to pay, but with Edoofa, the fees are decreased to $2700-$3700 for Edoofians. Now, for preparing for the finances for the student's higher education, parents need to understand that the minimum they need to save per month is $150 to ensure that at the end of 20 months, they can save around $3000. But if the amount saved after 20 months is around $600, @263773888622 you need to understand that Wynne may miss out on the opportunity of studying in the prestigious universities of India at affordable prices. So, I wanted to understand if you have any other backup plans as well to ensure that you can fully finance Wynne's higher education here in India?

57 - 23 Jan 2024 08:15AM - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you Recalling your counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy.

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22 - 22 Jan 2024 02:16PM - +263 77 396 3440: I am unable to understand which University application registration l failed to complete <This message was edited>
23 - 23 Jan 2024 09:34AM - Sahil Edoofa: I've noticed that the process has been moving at a slower pace, and it seems there might have been some delays on your end. Other students who reserved seats alongside you have already secured spots at universities. I'm here personally to expedite the process, ensuring you have ample time for proper planning.
24 - 23 Jan 2024 09:38AM - Sahil Edoofa: To confirm our records: you've chosen Bachelor of Business administartion for your higher education, and I understand you plan to arrive in India by August 2024. Is that correct?
25 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes thats correct Sir

27 - 23 Jan 2024 12:34PM - Sahil Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
28 - 23 Jan 2024 01:39PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes l recall the fee but when where the payment is done l wasn't informed
29 - 23 Jan 2024 02:41PM - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30 - 23 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sahil Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 <This message was edited>

31 - 23 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sahil Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
32 - 23 Jan 2024 02:44PM - +263 77 396 3440: No l understand Sir
33 - 23 Jan 2024 02:53PM - Sahil Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?

39 - 23 Jan 2024 03:15PM - Sahil Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
40 - 23 Jan 2024 03:15PM - Sahil Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
41 - 23 Jan 2024 03:17PM - +263 77 396 3440: Am pleased Sir
42 - 23 Jan 2024 04:09PM - Sahil Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.  We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
43 - 23 Jan 2024 05:41PM - +263 77 396 3440: That's very convenient
44 - 23 Jan 2024 08:46PM - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it‚Äôs been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:15 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!

34 - 23 Jan 2024 10:35AM - Sahil Edoofa: Based on your results, it seems you are currently not eligible for Agriculture/Agronomy due to the requirement of Biology as a compulsory subject in A level, which you don't fulfill. As your career counselor, I am interested in understanding your motivation for choosing this course. Additionally, considering your career aspirations, where do you see yourself after completing the course? This could involve possibilities like starting a business, pursuing a senior position in a mining sector, or even venturing into entrepreneurship.

36 - 23 Jan 2024 11:08AM - +263 77 409 5774: Agricultural economics is there such an option
37 - 23 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Sahil Edoofa: Certainly! Agricultural Economics is a field that combines principles of economics with agricultural practices. It focuses on understanding economic factors affecting agriculture, agribusiness, and rural areas.  Considering her interests and future employability aspects, here are three courses that may align well with her goals:  Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA): BBA provides a comprehensive understanding of business principles, management, and entrepreneurship. It equips you with skills applicable in various industries, including agriculture and agribusiness.  Bachelor in Economics: A degree in Economics offers in-depth knowledge of economic theories, policies, and their real-world applications. This foundation is valuable for understanding the economic dynamics of agriculture and related sectors.  Bachelor of Arts in Geography: Geography explores spatial relationships and human-environment interactions. In the context of agriculture, it could involve studying the geographical aspects of farming, land use, and environmental considerations.

This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
135 - 22 Jan 2024 03:43PM - Sahil Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
136 - 22 Jan 2024 03:44PM - +263 78 053 8549: Yes
137 - 23 Jan 2024 10:06AM - Sahil Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
138 - 23 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 78 053 8549: Okay
139 - 23 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Sahil Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
140 - 23 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
141 - 23 Jan 2024 12:46PM - +263 78 053 8549: Yes
142 - 23 Jan 2024 01:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?

11 - 22 Jan 2024 04:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: Recalling your counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
12 - 22 Jan 2024 04:14PM - +263 77 926 5201: I think maybe I was not made aware of the admission process prior to my writing exams,  I‚Äôve only been able to reconnect now as my results have just come in,  My understanding from our prior sessions was that admissions process would be done after results had come out, I don‚Äôt know if I am mistaken in that regard
13 - 23 Jan 2024 10:17AM - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning,  I've noticed a slower pace in the admission process, and it seems there might be delays on your end due to exams. However, other students who reserved seats have already secured spots. I'm here to expedite the process for you, given my limited time. Your commitment to remaining active is crucial, as I'll be dedicating my personal time to assist you.  Confirmation as per Records: you  have selected BBA (Information Technology), planning to arrive in India by August 2024?
14 - 23 Jan 2024 11:54AM - +263 77 926 5201: Yes that is correct,  Thank you very much for all the assistance üôè
15 - 23 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Sahil Edoofa: Welcome
16 - 23 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Sahil Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
17 - 23 Jan 2024 01:03PM - +263 77 926 5201: Oh okay I understand  I do not recall the registration fee amount, but I‚Äôm sure we paid a fee last year. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the same fee you are referring to?
18 - 23 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
19 - 23 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sahil Edoofa: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum 2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum 3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000

20 - 23 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sahil Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?

22 - 23 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Sahil Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth.

32 - 23 Jan 2024 04:32PM - Sahil Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.  We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
33 - 23 Jan 2024 04:44PM - +263 77 926 5201: Please let me know of the solution üôè
34 - 23 Jan 2024 04:56PM - Sahil Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.  Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
35 - 23 Jan 2024 04:58PM - Sahil Edoofa: For example, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
36 - 23 Jan 2024 05:01PM - +263 77 926 5201: I‚Äôm following on the details  So this is specifically for the registration fee right.  And for the rest of the tuition you said I pay within 3 days of landing and the rest will be due in December correct ?

I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?

25 - 23 Jan 2024 02:41PM - +27 73 417 1131: Oh I had no idea
26 - 23 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Shubham Edoofa: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

35 - 23 Jan 2024 03:04PM - +27 73 417 1131: We have not yet come up with the final decision but we have decided to apply both abroad and in local schools. But I want to pursue my education abroad at affordable schools.but if the prices are too high I will go to universities this side
36 - 23 Jan 2024 03:09PM - Shubham Edoofa: Dephine, Let me help you understand the same in much more detail
37 - 23 Jan 2024 03:09PM - Shubham Edoofa: While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
38 - 23 Jan 2024 03:10PM - Shubham Edoofa: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?

98 - 23 Jan 2024 08:33AM - Shubham Edoofa: Can you help me understand that why do you specifically want to pursue Social Work?
99 - 23 Jan 2024 08:41AM - +263 71 641 5156: The reason why l want to study social work is because l  desire to make a positive impact: Many people are driven by a genuine passion for helping others and making a positive difference in their lives. So l believe that social work provides an avenue to create meaningful change and improve the well-being of vulnerable individuals or communities.  Social work is considered a humanitarian profession, often centered around promoting social justice, equality, and human rights. So by pursueing  this field l will have a deep sense of empathy and a strong desire to support those who may face adversity or social injustices. I also have interest in addressing social issues: and what l mean by this is that : Social work offers an opportunity to work directly with various social issues such as poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, mental health, child welfare, and substance abuse. Those who want to contribute to solving these complex problems in society often find social work as a fulfilling option. So that's the reason why l want to do social work
100 - 23 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Shubham Edoofa: Duly noted Hilton, It's wonderful to hear about your passion and motivation for pursuing a career in social work. Your desire to make a positive impact, contribute to social justice, and address pressing social issues aligns well with the goals and values of the sociology profession.
101 - 23 Jan 2024 09:22AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes
102 - 23 Jan 2024 09:27AM - Shubham Edoofa: Hilton, first of all, I would like to help you understand that in India and many other countries Social work is considered a very niche course, and hence the amount of scholarship percentage offered for this course is very limited, that's the reason we do not cover this course under our scholarship, But we do understand that this field of work like Sociology/Social Work is very reputable and hence we recommend our students to pursue *BA in Sociology*, as globally considering this course is highly marketable, The reason being you would have more job opportunities plus you will also be able to fulfil you goal of bringing a positive impact to the society.
103 - 23 Jan 2024 09:28AM - +263 71 641 5156: Okay it's okay l can do a BA in Sociology
104 - 23 Jan 2024 09:28AM - Shubham Edoofa: Sociology is a broader academic discipline that studies society, human behaviour, and social institutions. Sociologists analyze patterns, relationships, and structures within society, aiming to understand social phenomena and contribute to theoretical frameworks. While sociology provides valuable insights into social structures and dynamics.
107 - 23 Jan 2024 09:31AM - Shubham Edoofa: So Shall I brief you about this course in detail?
108 - 23 Jan 2024 09:31AM - +263 71 641 5156: Yes sure
109 - 23 Jan 2024 09:37AM - Shubham Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs.

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

38 - 23 Jan 2024 02:05PM - Shubham Edoofa: Kundai, I hope you understand that While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
39 - 23 Jan 2024 02:05PM - Shubham Edoofa: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable.

42 - 23 Jan 2024 02:45PM - Shubham Edoofa: Kundai, Before I contacted you I had a brief discussion about your application with Mr Sagar and Mr Piiyush, And from what I was able to understand after discussing with them was, the reason you wanted to apply for the Edoofa scholarship or to study abroad was to get Quality Higher Education that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future, isn't it?

To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Planning and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28 - 23 Jan 2024 04:29PM - +263 71 444 1698: Yes it's correct.
29 - 23 Jan 2024 04:34PM - Shubham Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission, our main focus is on completing your scholarship application and sharing it with universities tailored to your chosen course, endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education. As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses. In the event that multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right ?
30 - 23 Jan 2024 04:35PM - +263 71 444 1698: Okay l understand.
31 - 23 Jan 2024 04:36PM - Shubham Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
269 - 23 Jan 2024 11:31AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
270 - 23 Jan 2024 11:32AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
271 - 23 Jan 2024 11:32AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.  We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
272 - 23 Jan 2024 11:41AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
273 - 23 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, allow me to help yo understand it better. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
274 - 23 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
275 - 23 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
276 - 23 Jan 2024 01:08PM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
277 - 23 Jan 2024 01:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?",No,Yes

I am also concerned with the universities that you offer l am afraid l might get admitted to a school that is at the outskirts of the country and that won't be really good Also about computer science l have researched about requirements and it requires for one to have a pass in Physics and l dont know anything about physics
153 - 23 Jan 2024 02:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263773287663, with all due respect, I understand what you are sharing, and I think there is some misunderstanding over here. No one has denied you from pursuing your interest of being an Actuary, rather as your admission officer I am trying my level best to ensure that as per your career aspiration you should have the best of the possibilities in life.  You can pursue your certification of Actuarial Sciences along with any of the Bachelor degree. Correct me if I am wrong, it seems to me like you have some doubts about the legitimacy of the universities and courses offered by Edoofa. As your admission officer, I am personally available to help you with any doubts or queries that you have regarding your educational journey. Understanding you better will help me provide an appropriate solution for you, and unless we have open and transparent conversations, it cannot be achieved. I hope we are together in this?

155 - 23 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you agree Tanatswa. In that case, could you kindly help me understand what it is that is bothering you exactly?  Alternatively, I can also arrange for a call with the Program Director at Edoofa, and you may directly share your concerns with him so that he can address it and help you get a better understanding of the program and the universities we are associated with. Would you prefer that?

The reason you enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program was to help yourself get access to better opportunities in India, and since the past two years, this is the moment you and your family were waiting for. They were waiting for you to get your A Level results so that you can chart the way forward for your dreams of education abroad, and now that we have reached that stage, it seems as if you yourself have given up on everything we have worked for so far. Maybe that is the reason I am not able to understand you well, and I'm not sure what it is that you want us to do to help you with the way forward. Can you help me here?
167 - 23 Jan 2024 04:20PM - +263 77 328 7663: I already got my A level results and I'm sure l sent you the results

169 - 23 Jan 2024 04:55PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes Tanatswa, you did send your A-Level results. I understand that you wish to become an actuary scientist someday, and that is exactly what I am trying to help you with. This is the reason why I suggested you to have a call with our Program Director, because on a call you will be able to explain your concerns clearly and also be able to understand the solution that we are trying to provide you. Without having an open mind about our conversation, we will not be able to reach a desirable solution. I'm unsure about what you need us to do to assist you in moving forward. Can you help me understand the same?

It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
69 - 23 Jan 2024 11:36AM - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating?

93 - 23 Jan 2024 11:28AM - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
94 - 23 Jan 2024 11:34AM - +263 71 275 6055: If given this opportunity l would like to educational system in my country by offering Electrical gadgets such as laptops to improve the way we learn and easy learning again and in the near future if all is well l  would like to build schools so that everyone gets access to quality education
95 - 23 Jan 2024 11:42AM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Dione, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
96 - 23 Jan 2024 11:43AM - +263 71 275 6055: Yes I agree
97 - 23 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
124 - 23 Jan 2024 01:17PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
125 - 23 Jan 2024 01:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:   *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
126 - 23 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 71 275 6055: Okay I understand now
127 - 23 Jan 2024 01:19PM - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
128 - 23 Jan 2024 01:20PM - +263 71 275 6055: Okay I understand thank you for your time
129 - 23 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Dione what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
130 - 23 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
131 - 23 Jan 2024 01:41PM - +263 71 275 6055: Yes
132 - 23 Jan 2024 01:43PM - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
133 - 23 Jan 2024 01:43PM - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.   1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

128 - 23 Jan 2024 03:32PM - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
129 - 23 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Garima Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

358 - 23 Jan 2024 10:57AM - Garima Edoofa: Well  as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:   1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.  3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.  But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as  1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing 2. Bachelor in  Pharmacy 3. Bachelor in Physiotherapy 4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology  These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.

114 - 23 Jan 2024 11:20AM - +263 71 578 5475: First, studying in India can have a positive impact on my career because it gives me the opportunity to experience a different culture, meet new people, and learn new ways of thinking. It can also expose me to different job opportunities  that l might not have considered before.
115 - 23 Jan 2024 11:25AM - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tanya. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

116 - 23 Jan 2024 11:29AM - +263 71 578 5475: I think it's very expensive
117 - 23 Jan 2024 11:46AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the same, please so that you can have a better clarity.
118 - 23 Jan 2024 11:47AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.  Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
119 - 23 Jan 2024 11:47AM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
120 - 23 Jan 2024 11:54AM - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *BSc Forensic Science* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

229 - 23 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
230 - 23 Jan 2024 10:10AM - +263 78 286 3286: Yes l did
231 - 23 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
232 - 23 Jan 2024 11:05AM - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
233 - 23 Jan 2024 12:06PM - Gurvinder: Ashley as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
234 - 23 Jan 2024 12:13PM - +263 78 286 3286: 1500 -2250
235 - 23 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Ashley, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

230 - 23 Jan 2024 10:10AM - +263 78 286 3286: Yes l did
231 - 23 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
232 - 23 Jan 2024 11:05AM - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah
233 - 23 Jan 2024 12:06PM - Gurvinder: Ashley as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
234 - 23 Jan 2024 12:13PM - +263 78 286 3286: 1500 -2250
235 - 23 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Ashley, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17 - 23 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18 - 23 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

111 - 23 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
112 - 23 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

117 - 23 Jan 2024 01:40PM - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir go ahead
118 - 23 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: Chisomo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
119 - 23 Jan 2024 02:00PM - +260 97 3642584: It's a Very nice program
120 - 23 Jan 2024 02:15PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
131 - 23 Jan 2024 02:15PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
132 - 23 Jan 2024 02:15PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

134 - 23 Jan 2024 02:32PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Chisomo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
135 - 23 Jan 2024 02:37PM - +260 97 3642584: Okay
136 - 23 Jan 2024 02:58PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14 - 23 Jan 2024 01:36PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa‚Äôs Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating?

111 - 23 Jan 2024 09:21AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
112 - 23 Jan 2024 09:28AM - +260 96 8297698: Yes I think this will benefit me.
113 - 23 Jan 2024 09:50AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Katonga, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
114 - 23 Jan 2024 09:55AM - +260 96 8297698: Understood.
115 - 23 Jan 2024 10:06AM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

143 - 23 Jan 2024 10:06AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
144 - 23 Jan 2024 10:36AM - +260 96 8297698: It's exactly what I have been looking for
145 - 23 Jan 2024 11:47AM - Gurvinder: Alright Katongo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

149 - 23 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?

151 - 23 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Gurvinder: Katongo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

366 - 23 Jan 2024 08:59AM - +260 97 9164462: Just the question about admission without results
367 - 23 Jan 2024 09:18AM - Gurvinder: Please, we reserve the seat for the student in the University based on the previous results as the more the student waits the less scholarship seats are available in the Universities which reduced their chances of getting an acceptance letter in more Universities, doing so this soon gives them an option to start their EWYL program also gives them a chance to earn scholarship credits, and if we assume that a student earns $100 per month, then a student would already have $600 in scholarship credits for their tuition fees.
368 - 23 Jan 2024 10:45AM - +260 96 5133048: Good morning everyone . Sorry for not being active because I have been very busy with school too. Hope everyone is okay

373 - 23 Jan 2024 12:01PM - Gurvinder: Alright @260979164462, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zambia  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
374 - 23 Jan 2024 12:08PM - +260 97 9164462: I will leave that gor the parents to answer.. But what is the name of your Associates account in Zambia?
375 - 23 Jan 2024 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Can you please ask the same to the parents?
376 - 23 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.
377 - 23 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  *US Dollar Account* Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  *Zambian Kwacha Account*  Bank Name: Indo Zambia Bank Branch: Jacaranda Account Name: Penmal Connect Limited Account Number: 0222030000591 Swift Code: INZAZMLX Sort Code: 090122

If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.  Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.  The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa‚Äôs Associated Universities, etc.  The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
221 - 23 Jan 2024 09:11AM - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child‚Äôs tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa‚Äôs Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*

489 - 23 Jan 2024 11:46AM - Gurvinder: Alright @263773860955,so now since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
490 - 23 Jan 2024 12:20PM - +263 77 386 0955: The 2 nd one
491 - 23 Jan 2024 01:08PM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.  So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
133 - 23 Jan 2024 01:44PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

140 - 23 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Gurvinder: Quinton, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
141 - 23 Jan 2024 03:22PM - +263 71 854 7509: It is unique indeed
142 - 23 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

186 - 23 Jan 2024 03:55PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

18 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23 - 23 Jan 2024 01:55PM - +263 77 627 9577: Thanks so much for their information
24 - 23 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Gurvinder: Please address this.
25 - 23 Jan 2024 02:11PM - +263 77 627 9577: It is
26 - 23 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mfundi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27 - 23 Jan 2024 10:20PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!
118 - 23 Jan 2024 08:54AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!  *‚ÄúThe way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.""*  Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
119 - 23 Jan 2024 08:58AM - +263 71 321 1883: Good morning
120 - 23 Jan 2024 09:14AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
121 - 23 Jan 2024 09:14AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
122 - 23 Jan 2024 09:14AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

134 - 23 Jan 2024 10:03AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Michael, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
135 - 23 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 71 321 1883: So how these points obtained
136 - 23 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Gurvinder: Please these are obtained by successfully completing the given projects.

169 - 23 Jan 2024 01:23PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
170 - 23 Jan 2024 01:54PM - +263 71 321 1883: This is wonderful üòä
171 - 23 Jan 2024 01:55PM - +263 71 321 1883: That's great and l have been looking for such opportunities
172 - 23 Jan 2024 02:04PM - Gurvinder: Alright Michael, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
173 - 23 Jan 2024 02:07PM - +263 78 627 7197: Yes that‚Äôs true
174 - 23 Jan 2024 02:24PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
175 - 23 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +263 71 321 1883: Yes we have discussed it
176 - 23 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
177 - 23 Jan 2024 02:31PM - +263 71 321 1883: Yes
178 - 23 Jan 2024 02:31PM - Gurvinder: Michael as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

179 - 23 Jan 2024 02:34PM - +263 71 321 1883: $	1500-$2500
180 - 23 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Michael, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
181 - 23 Jan 2024 02:36PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
182 - 23 Jan 2024 02:40PM - +263 71 321 1883: That's affordable as compared to individual applications
183 - 23 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don‚Äôt you think so?
184 - 23 Jan 2024 03:22PM - +263 71 321 1883: That's exactly what I think
185 - 23 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
186 - 23 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: Michael basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
187 - 23 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.",No,Yes

134 - 23 Jan 2024 09:22AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Peace, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

168 - 23 Jan 2024 02:02PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
169 - 23 Jan 2024 02:02PM - +263 77 137 2401: I am interested

179 - 23 Jan 2024 03:03PM - Gurvinder: Peace as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

113 - 23 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
114 - 23 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
115 - 23 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

166 - 23 Jan 2024 02:34PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
167 - 23 Jan 2024 02:34PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
168 - 23 Jan 2024 02:38PM - +260 97 3209479: Yes it is
169 - 23 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Gurvinder: Alright Pelekelo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
170 - 23 Jan 2024 03:03PM - +260 97 3209479: Yes they would
171 - 23 Jan 2024 03:04PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
172 - 23 Jan 2024 03:05PM - +260 97 3209479: I have made them aware of the Edoofa scholarship and they aware of the program
173 - 23 Jan 2024 03:06PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?",No,Yes

276 - 23 Jan 2024 12:12PM - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Runyararo* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
277 - 23 Jan 2024 12:12PM - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Runyararo‚Äôs* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.

135 - 23 Jan 2024 09:09AM - +263 78 039 0856: How are you
136 - 23 Jan 2024 09:09AM - +263 78 039 0856: Good morning
137 - 23 Jan 2024 09:42AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
138 - 23 Jan 2024 09:43AM - +263 78 039 0856: No we are not aware but as l once heard that it's affordable
139 - 23 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
140 - 23 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
141 - 23 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
142 - 23 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
143 - 23 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
144 - 23 Jan 2024 09:46AM - +263 78 039 0856: So how l do l get a 100 %fully funded schoolarship
145 - 23 Jan 2024 09:56AM - Gurvinder: Please that will depend on the counselling session, the scholarship test, and the interview.
146 - 23 Jan 2024 10:37AM - +263 78 039 0856: Ohh okay l get it
147 - 23 Jan 2024 12:11PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
148 - 23 Jan 2024 12:34PM - +263 78 039 0856: Yes please
149 - 23 Jan 2024 12:57PM - Gurvinder: @263780390856, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

136 - 23 Jan 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
137 - 23 Jan 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
138 - 23 Jan 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

139 - 23 Jan 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
140 - 23 Jan 2024 01:21PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*",No,No

15 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

17 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19 - 23 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 77 853 8004: It is thank you for the briefing
20 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Sithandweyinkosi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

17 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18 - 23 Jan 2024 10:05AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

20 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Sithandweyinkosi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

36 - 23 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Gurvinder: Sinclaire, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
37 - 23 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics  2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology  3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology  4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology  5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy  6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology  7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

45 - 23 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
46 - 23 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

I would be working on cutting-edge research to develop new treatments and vaccines for viral diseases.  I would be collaborating with other scientists from around the world to share ideas and advance our understanding of viruses.  I would also be educating the public about the importance of viruses and the role they play in our lives.  And finally, I would be working to promote biosecurity and biosafety measures to protect the public from the potential risks of viruses. I also hope to see a paradigm shift in the way we study and understand viruses.  Instead of focusing solely on disease, I would like to see a greater emphasis on the potential benefits of viruses.  For example, some viruses can be used to treat cancer, and others can be harnessed to produce biofuels and other renewable resources.  I would also like to see more collaboration between different scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and computer science, to better understand the complex nature of viruses.  This could lead to exciting new discoveries . Not forgetting to support my family financially and take over the responsibility of my sister's education ....

107 - 23 Jan 2024 11:36AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
108 - 23 Jan 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
109 - 23 Jan 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
110 - 23 Jan 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
111 - 23 Jan 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

116 - 23 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Gurvinder: Takunda, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>

35 - 23 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during Trshon's introduction you mentioned he would like to study Phamarcy, could you please share what motivates him behind this field of study?
36 - 23 Jan 2024 03:49PM - +263 77 537 8218: Trishon had a passion in pharmacy because he would want to open his phamarcy shops as they are few in our country, especially in our town . There is only one pharmacy shop in our town which can cannot provide for the whole town ,l therefore need to curb this problem.  The other motive is that Pharmacists  on our local hospital are being offered better job opportunities by other big hospitals so they are always vacancies on these small scale hospitals or even bigger ones because of few pharmacists in the country. l therefore need this opportunity to study pharmacy because it offers greater employment opportunities too besides being a pharmacy entrepreneur

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
102 - 17 Jan 2024 09:51PM - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well  I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

104 - 18 Jan 2024 11:43PM - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.  Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn‚Äôt respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.  Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1IDdUSWf-Q&t=590s
105 - 23 Jan 2024 01:06PM - +263 78 660 7006: Hello, How are you? I hope you are doing well. I had to take some time to myself to make a deep research on the career path I would want to pursue. I came to a realization that Data Science is a vast field with a lot of attributes to it besides some universities and colleges offering it as a Undergraduate degree whereas it is a department with its core fundementals and related skills to be a specialist in the field. My research tells me I need a strong foundation in Statistics and then along the journey you major into some related courses or programs that improve your career profile. I‚Äôm kindly requesting to get assistance into acquiring the best place for a degree in Statistics so that I further my career and ambitions from that baseline going forward. I hope to be working with you in future career advancement studies as I proceed to the masters and more qualifications. I hope you will respond soon.  My apologies for the hold and delay in making a solid decision. I‚Äôm very sorry for the confusion, I showed and I promise to work with you guys properly until the last process of this application.

I couldn‚Äôt proceed with my application with you because I had no much research in my studies and what I wanted to pursue, no career guidance and people to assist me from my side so I had to withdraw my application and try to find out all the information I could get to have a solid background for my career path. I am sorry for not communicating and not participating as noted in the terms of this program. I hope we could continue on a fresh page and hope for you to understand that this time around I don‚Äôt have a double minded decision.

But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

312 - 23 Jan 2024 08:55AM - +27 83 583 5333: Fine with me
313 - 23 Jan 2024 09:04AM - Keshav Edoofa: Chamaine, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I share the interview slots I would like you and Mr. Bervely as well to answer a few of my questions.  So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
314 - 23 Jan 2024 09:46AM - +27 83 583 5333: It's difficult for me but will try
315 - 23 Jan 2024 10:13AM - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Bervely, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program.  One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
316 - 23 Jan 2024 10:13AM - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors  1. Student himself/herself 2. FAMILY 3. EDOOFA PROGAM  Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs.  Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
317 - 23 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education.  *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
318 - 23 Jan 2024 10:46AM - +27 83 583 5333: If it's within the parameters of my financial limits I'm willing to support her to the fullest
319 - 23 Jan 2024 10:51AM - Keshav Edoofa: Much appreciated Mr. Bervely, Can you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
326 - 23 Jan 2024 11:27AM - +27 83 583 5333: If it's end of this January tight program
327 - 23 Jan 2024 11:31AM - Keshav Edoofa: I didnt understand it fully Mr. Bervely can you please elaborate?
328 - 23 Jan 2024 11:36AM - +27 83 583 5333: If she is eligible then I have to seek financial help from friends, relatives even well wishers because alone the time frame is short to raise the amount
329 - 23 Jan 2024 11:43AM - Keshav Edoofa: I really admire your willingness Mr. Bervely for your child's education, I am here to help you out with any challenges you are facing and to resolve them out  However, as a parent will you be available to meet the 7-day deadline for the program that can help to transform your child's future?
330 - 23 Jan 2024 12:10PM - +27 83 583 5333: I will make sure I'm available for the 7days
331 - 23 Jan 2024 12:41PM - Keshav Edoofa: From your reply I get that you will proceed ahead with the option 1 regarding the payment policy that is you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th of January 2024 for $200 and the 28th or 29th of February for the remaining $150. Am I right?

10 - 23 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
11 - 23 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*",No,Yes

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

232 - 23 Jan 2024 09:57AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay I want to ask ,I have checked on the list of programs you send yesterday but I did not see Social Work ,so am I allowed to choose one of the program from your list .
233 - 23 Jan 2024 10:54AM - Keshav Edoofa: You see Praise, being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.  Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work  Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.  So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
234 - 23 Jan 2024 11:26AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay you can briefly explain B.A(Hons.) in Sociology
235 - 23 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Keshav Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.  *Course Outline*  This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people‚Äôs lives and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by. This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research.

This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program  *Enrollment fee* For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
223 - 23 Jan 2024 11:34AM - Kunal: *Registration Fee* The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.  *The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*  For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600  The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family",No,No

This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later. *So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

12 - 23 Jan 2024 11:46AM - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.   *So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

102 - 23 Jan 2024 09:29AM - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
103 - 23 Jan 2024 09:36AM - +263 78 251 3564: 4.Higher Education Concierge
104 - 23 Jan 2024 10:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: Great! So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

122 - 23 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Pallika Edoofa: That‚Äôs understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.  May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
123 - 23 Jan 2024 11:13AM - +263 78 251 3564: They have mixed feelings because of how l am going to adopt to a new environment but at the same time they would love for me to get the best and quality education
124 - 23 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
125 - 23 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
126 - 23 Jan 2024 11:35AM - +263 78 251 3564: No l don't
127 - 23 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
128 - 23 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

130 - 23 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain this to you
131 - 23 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
130 - 23 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain this to you
131 - 23 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
132 - 23 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
133 - 23 Jan 2024 12:04PM - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn‚Äôt meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year‚Äôs annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.

137 - 23 Jan 2024 12:47PM - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Kudzaishe, We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.  *Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.  *Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with steps 5 and 6. So shall I explain them to you?

125 - 22 Jan 2024 12:40PM - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

154 - 23 Jan 2024 11:10AM - +263 77 383 4811: My parents
155 - 23 Jan 2024 11:16AM - Pallika Edoofa: That‚Äôs understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.  May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
156 - 23 Jan 2024 11:21AM - +263 77 383 4811: Given the fact that Edoofa will be part of it, they see it as an opportunity for me to have quality education such that i achieve my career goal
157 - 23 Jan 2024 11:45AM - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
158 - 23 Jan 2024 11:46AM - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
159 - 23 Jan 2024 11:54AM - +263 77 383 4811: So where do i submit the above
160 - 23 Jan 2024 12:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: Tanatswa, Our admission team will be guiding you at every step, and guide you for the same!
161 - 23 Jan 2024 12:06PM - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.",No,Yes

119 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
120 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
121 - 23 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
122 - 23 Jan 2024 10:32AM - +263 71 683 1649: Noted it's affordable

281 - 23 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor, you will be glad to know that in your university during the final year, a plethora of companies will conduct placement drives. If you are competent, you will be able to score a job in your dream company!

284 - 23 Jan 2024 12:42PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
285 - 23 Jan 2024 12:47PM - +263 71 300 2882: Other requirements can include financial stability, a clean criminal record, and a valid passport.
286 - 23 Jan 2024 12:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
287 - 23 Jan 2024 12:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
288 - 23 Jan 2024 12:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
290 - 23 Jan 2024 03:44PM - +263 71 300 2882: Okay
291 - 23 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
292 - 23 Jan 2024 03:46PM - +263 71 300 2882: Okay
293 - 23 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
294 - 23 Jan 2024 03:50PM - +263 71 300 2882: If student is found eligible for scholarship he/she will be charged with $350 enrollment fee to join Edoofa program and get assisted with several important aspects of claiming and taking a seat at a university abroad. This fee can be paid in two installments considering current situation in African Nations.
295 - 23 Jan 2024 04:16PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?

300 - 23 Jan 2024 09:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?
