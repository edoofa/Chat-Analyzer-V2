I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
13/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Let's start
13/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 544 9247: I'm done
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
13/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 544 9247: They are clear
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
13/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Yes
13/09/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
13/09/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
13/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 544 9247: This is clear
13/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Yes proceed
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 544 9247: We are on the same page
13/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
13/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
13/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?

15/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 544 9247: That correct, madam

15/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Thank you, have a pleasant night to you too.
15/09/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
18/09/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Evening
18/09/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 766 6158: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 766 6158: 2.The Business Process Management lifecycle is comprised of 5 phases which are  process design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each phase of the lifecycle builds on the previous one and the result is an efficient and effective BPM system that meets the needs of the business. 
 Business process design is a method used to create a new workflow from scratch.New organizations engage in business process design when they start thinking about the ways that they will produce and deliver their products and services. 
Business process modeling is the graphical representation of a company's business processes or workflows, as a means of identifying potential improvements. This is usually done through different graphing methods, such as the flowchart and data-flow diagram.
Execute. Once both your design and modeling processes are done, it's time to start using them. We call this the execution stage, where we test all the improvements designed earlier in the process. This stage of the life cycle takes the design and model and implements them into the business process.
Business process monitoring is the activity of reviewing and analyzing the performance of such processes to identify successes and problems. Monitoring is an integral part of the business process management  lifecycle. 
The fifth and last step of the lifecycle is  optimize.  Based on the insights gained during the monitoring phase, you will strive to improve the process and remove bottlenecks in this phase to make your process more efficient.


3.Businesses also drive the economy when they hire workers, raise wages, and invest in growing their businesses. A company that buys a new manufacturing plant or invests in new technologies creates jobs and spending, which leads to growth in the economy. Attracting and growing businesses strengthens our economy providing locally-produced goods and services.Strong businesses pay taxes that go for vital services such as schools, roads, fire, and police. Businesses also provide good jobs that put money in people's pockets and allow for a higher quality of life.

Businesses Can contribute to the economic development through Net income and revenues. For example, are forms of economic benefit. Profit and net cash flow are also economic benefits. An economic benefit may also refer to a reduction in something such as a cost. For example, lower raw material or labor costs are economic benefits.

4.Business ethics (also known as corporate ethics) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics, that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations. These ethics originate from individuals, organizational statements or the legal system.These norms, values, ethical, and unethical practices are the principles that guide a business.Business ethics refers to contemporary organizational standards, principles, sets of values and norms that govern the actions and behavior of an individual in the business organization. Business ethics have two dimensions, normative business ethics or descriptive business ethics. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative.
Business ethics is important because it enhances the law by outlining acceptable behaviors beyond government control. Corporations establish business ethics to promote integrity among their employees and gain trust from key stakeholders, such as investors and consumers.Without a strong set of ethics, a business can run afoul of the law, encounter financial pitfalls and moral dilemmas.


4. Human Resources plays a key role in developing, reinforcing and changing the culture of an organisation. Pay, performance management, training and development, recruitment and onboarding and reinforcing the values of the business are all essential elements of business culture covered by HR.
HR development may also take the form of various organizational changes in your business. For example, you may promote someone doing a great job and integrate them into your HR changes. You could also adjust your HR structure and execution to create a more efficient and easy-to-understand model for your employees.
HR should equip managers and leadership to be role models for the behavior changes so that employees will emulate the conduct necessary to embrace the new culture. Additionally, HR needs to help ensure that high-value talent is identified or developed and then allocated properly to key roles.
HR should equip managers and leadership to be role models for the behavior changes so that employees will emulate the conduct necessary to embrace the new culture. Additionally, HR needs to help ensure that high-value talent is identified or developed and then allocated properly to key roles.HR is generally tasked with making sure that company culture is reflected in all aspects of the employee cycle - recruitment, onboarding, policy development, learning and development - and everything else that involves employees. However, culture comes from the top down.

20/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 766 6158: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phillippa.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
20/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
20/09/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Phillippa wants to pursue Diploma in Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Good afternoon
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Thanks for sharing
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Yes Diploma in bachelor of business administration
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
20/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Afternoon Ms Kirti, Alright
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Alright
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes Im ready
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes it is not possible
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Correct
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes we are on the same page
20/09/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings kindly excuse me for the delay, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Evening, Yes I am
20/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 544 9247: We are also available. My wife and I are using one phone
20/09/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, So may I know if you if we are clear here?
20/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 544 9247: You are clear
20/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 544 9247: What happens if parents let's give an example that they have failed to pay the due balance after the scholarship has paid it's share, the $2000-$3000 to be paid by parents?
20/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, however, may I know why do you think that you will not be able to pay the due balance?
20/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 544 9247: It deepends with her  scholarship percentage
21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phillippa.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was almost past our available hours, so we were unable to get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me, In that case, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Afternoon Ms Kirti, Im now available
25/09/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phillippa.

I hope you are doing well, and had a great weekend, kindly excuse us for not connecting with you earlier, since it was the weekend and we were unavailable. However, we can connect now, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/09/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Afternoon Ms Kirti, we did Thank you. Yes I'm available
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you are clear here?
25/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Good afternoon Ms Kirti
25/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes we are
25/09/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phillippa

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond and I noticed that you were able to go through the message, so may I know if you are facing any challenges that you would like to share?
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Good Afternoon Ms Kirti, Im sorry for the mishap. The time I read your message was After your business hours, How Ever is it Still possible to reply ?
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright @263777666158 Yes you can respond to the message, however, if it is past our available hours then we will respond to your message the next day.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Alright
26/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes I do
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Alright
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Yes we get it, but we as parents are not sure if we are able to raise $2800.
26/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why do you think in such way @263715449247?
26/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 544 9247: It's a bit in our economy to find such money. This is why we hope our daughter will get 100% scholarship
26/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 544 9247: We are trying our best to see if it works financially
26/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I recognize that raising this sum can be quite a daunting task. Nevertheless, considering that Phillippa's admission is scheduled for August 2024, you have nearly a year to achieve this goal. I have every confidence that your determination and dedication will enable you to fulfill your daughter's aspirations.
26/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you here. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phillippa.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges since you were able to go through the message as well?
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Good afternoon Ms Kirti. I understand what you said yesterday.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 544 9247: Sorry for the late response
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I am glad to know that you are clear @263715449247. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes We are
27/09/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two O Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their Diploma education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Right
27/09/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in O Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 6)*
27/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 766 6158: I'd agree with number 1
27/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Putting a Stop to education is not a solution
27/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in O Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the O Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Yes I am
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good to know that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Duly noted
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 766 6158: For now I dont but if I do, I'll surely ask
27/09/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that As your guardian, I hope your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 766 6158: Oh Yes I'm excited
27/09/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
