I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

12/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
13/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 616 3996: Noted
13/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 616 3996: I am ready for the session
13/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. So may I know if you could share me the understanding about the recent discussions - *message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*
18/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263780770016 @263776877256 @263776163996
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 077 0016: Good afternoon Mrs Shivjeet
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 077 0016: How is everything there
19/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 077 0016: Im sorry for not being available for the session most of the time its because i will be busy with discussion . Im  now writing A level exams
19/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 077 0016: My Sister will do on behalf of me then i will carry on
19/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your response and I understand that you have been occupied with your A level exams. It's important to prioritize your education, and I'm glad to hear that your sister will be assisting you in your absence. May I know if she is available now?
19/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 616 3996: Yes I am available
19/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
19/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 616 3996: Yes we are
19/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
19/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 616 3996: I have hone through them
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 616 3996: Indeed this is a great advantage
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 616 3996: I also understood the number 2 benefit

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your messages by the time you have shared, as it was past my available hours. So, shall we connect this evening at 7:30 PM to further proceed with the session?

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?
26/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered. Nonetheless, I am fully prepared to initiate our session. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities. If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.
