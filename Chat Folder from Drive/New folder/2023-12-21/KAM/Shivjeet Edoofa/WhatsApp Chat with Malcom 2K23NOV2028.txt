This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Okay I hear you
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Malcom EWYL23E0967)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
29/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yess I understand
29/11/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Well my first Councillor Mr Kunal was a huge help he assisted me in understanding more abt the program and how the program also provides career guidance and provides more insight on a student's chosen career field hence I understand wat I rlly like is this opportunity which the program takes to lighten up a student's chosen career field and helps the student understand it better and also the EWYL Program which is a huge advantage which enables earning scholarship credits and being able to make the fees more affordable hence not depriving the student education. I also like the dedication of the councillors in assisting us and sharing the advantages of studying in India
29/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and your counseling experience with Mr. Kunal. It's wonderful to hear about the support and insights you've received, especially in understanding your chosen career field and the opportunities available through the program.

The emphasis on providing career guidance and insight into your field of interest, along with the Earn While You Learn Program, indeed presents an incredible advantage. The opportunity to earn scholarship credits and make education more accessible is commendable and aligns with the program's commitment to facilitating education without financial constraints.
29/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yess m ready
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Okay I've gone through it
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
04/12/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes
04/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 140 5373: I am following
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Okay I understand
04/12/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

14/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes I am
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
14/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes I watched the 4 videos
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
14/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Well in the first video I understood tt the EWYL Program instills independence in a student and that there is help around as Mr Angad explained and you can only benefit if you are able to ask for it in the proper manner and right direction from the experts 
As an edoofa student you need to be open minded and teachable and also follow the instructions you are given
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 140 5373: In the second video I understood that edoofa not only gets a student admitted in a school but also increases a student's capacity for success hence equipping the student with a responsibility and independence
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 140 5373: In the 3rd video I learnt tt as a student you shld be prompt and also that Edoofa has put in a lot of time and effort to identify the best schools hence as edoofians we are encouraged to keep following the instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institutions
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 140 5373: In the 4th video I got to knoe a bit about the SOP and that it is a very important document and as students we shld be prompt in taking action as well as diligent in filling it out
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
14/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

16/12/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 140 5373: *Some common causes of Gas pipeline vibration 20 Carbon steel lines*

1. *Possibility that the gas is reaching critical flow downstream*
Critical flow occurs when the flow velocity in a channel equals the wave velocity generated by a disturbance 

2. *Compressor Surging*
Occurs when the amount of gas trying to be compressed is insufficient for the size of the compressor hence blades lose their ability to transfer energy from the shaft to the fluid causing a reverse flow of the gas 

3. *Pressure cycling in the tower*
Takes place when fluctuations occurs during the course of operations as we start, stop pumps and move oil products with varying densities and viscosities 
 
4. *Two phase flow*
Occurs in various forms such as flows transitioning from pure liquid to vapor as a result of external heating and separated flows
16/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 140 5373: *Using a pumping loop to mix miscible fluids in a tank the contents are considered well mixed when:*

Firstly to understand a pumping loop, it is a system that circulates fluids in a closed loop to mix them. 
Once the fluids have been mixed in the tank the general rule to consider a well mixture is to turn the tank over three times and then sample the tank for mixture properties. By turning the tank over, you actually force the entire volume of the tank through the pump at least three times. Some more turnovers may also be necessary in some instances.
16/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 140 5373: *General rules for flushing  slurry lines*
 
A slurry line is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores such as coal/iron or mining waste over long distances. 
A mixture of the ore concentrate and water called slurry is pumped to its destination and water filtered out. 

Some of the general rules:

Slurry lines should be flushed with a minimum fluid velocity of 10 ft/s and the total flushing liquid volume should be equal to three to six times the total piping volume. 
The pump should also not be rotating and the liquid in the pump should be stationery, not flowing in or out of the pump prior to starting the flush procedure.
If there is a closed discharge valve in the system the vent valve between the pump and the discharge valve must be open.
16/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 140 5373: *Pneumatic conveying*

It is a method for transferring dry bulk materials like powders and granules using compressed  gas or air from one processing centre to another through an enclosed conveying line using a  combination of pressure differential and airflow from a blower fan or compressor.
It is an efficient means of handling and transferring various types of bulk granular and powdered products with minimal loss and lower cost than n other systems 

*There are 2 main types:*
Lean phase and dense phase

*Lean phase*- is commonly used and is used for granules and powders.
There are 2 categories under Lean phase :
1) Dilute phase - it is for conveying non-abrasive materials with low bulk density e.g flour
It has a gas velocity greater than  17 ms‐¹ with lower vacuum 

2) Medium phase - particles travelling through pipeline remain suspended throughout with a low concentration or solids loading ratio. 

*Dense phase* - is ideal for moving sensitive and fragile products. 
Products travel at lower velocities and some common applications include abrasives such as sugar and blended products.
19/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 706 6470: Please help with the account number for payment of enrollment fee
19/12/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Good evening sir we are doing just fine thank you
19/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Chemical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes that's correct
19/12/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/12/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/12/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes plz elaborate
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
19/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes it is
19/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 140 5373: By the way plz allow me to send the pictures of receipts of the remaining $150 enrollment fee
19/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 140 5373: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 140 5373: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Malcom. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for being patient with us. 
Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your university Registration Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
20/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Good evening sir, thank you
20/12/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
20/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes
20/12/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yes please
20/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
20/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 140 5373: Yess
20/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 706 6470: Thank you
