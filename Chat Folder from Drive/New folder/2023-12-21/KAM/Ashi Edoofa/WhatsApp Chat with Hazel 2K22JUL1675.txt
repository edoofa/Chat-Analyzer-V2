I hope you are doing well today.
03/08/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I believe you are misunderstood about the amounts that you have paid, so let me share the exact calculation of the payments that you have made so far towards your registration fee as well as the balance.

5. $150 on 19th July 2023

7. $50 on 20th July 2023
03/08/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Total amount paid becomes: $630 
Total amount that due towards registration Fee: $777

Balance amount that is to be paid: $777 - $630 = $147.

03/08/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 390 7221: To help you with the balance of Hazel's fee, let me share the breakup with you here -

Registration fee due: $700
Including international transfer charges of 11%: $700 + $77 = $777
Paid amount: $100 + $30 = $130
Balance to be paid: $777 - $130 = $647
03/08/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 390 7221: Alright, please. Let me share the details of all the payments that you made for a better understanding:

I hope you are doing well. I can genuinely empathize with the challenges and busy schedules you have @263773907221.

I appreciate your concern regarding the payment schedule for the first installment as the desire to pay the whole amount in December. It's imperative to emphasize the importance of making the first installment this month. As you're likely aware, the 2023 academic session commenced back in August, in order to reserve your scholarship seat in the University it's necessary to complete this payment.
16/11/23, 11:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: However, As you mentioned that you are working on Visa and Airticket @263773907221, but I want to share that there is no requirement to work on flight ticket considering that Hazel will arrive in 2024 and we have enough time to work on Visa and ticket. I hope you understand the importance of University Registration Process.

16/11/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263773907221 I hope you have misunderstood my previous message, as the university has shared that the first installment must be paid by the end of this month. Considering the same, May I know how much will you be able to pay by this month so that I can truly understand the situation?
16/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 390 7221: Will tell you
