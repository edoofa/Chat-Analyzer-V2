19/10/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing the results, Derylin,

I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes. <This message was edited>

20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

20/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 111 7306: I understood that  theEWYL programme  is the backbone of Edoofa where  students  are  given real-time live online  projects during  which  that cab gain excellent  work  experience  while getting the opportunity to  earn scholarship  credits (based on student  performance)that is equivalent  to  cash. However ,the credits can be used to  pay  off a significant part of their  higher education fees and make their  university  education more  affordable. It also helps the student  to learn  and develop  skills  necessary  for the  digital  workspace  environment. The EWYL Programme has been solidified  and strethened only because  of the vision  it has set,and the alignment  of the  industry  leaders  with it. So basically  the  EWYL programme  helps students  to financially  support  themselves  and assist their parents  in paying  fees after Edoofa
20/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Answer for number  6
20/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 111 7306: 7.not clear
20/10/23, 4:17 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living
20/10/23, 4:18 pm - Austin: The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1600 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1600-600= $1000
20/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Oh ok  understood
20/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Ok thank you  on that  one
