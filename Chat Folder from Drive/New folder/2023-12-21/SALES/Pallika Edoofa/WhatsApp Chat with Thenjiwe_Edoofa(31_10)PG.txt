30/10/23, 9:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,


I am *Ms. Pallika*, and I am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *12:30 PM CAT tomorrow (31/10/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. <This message was edited>

01/11/23, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!

I hope that you all are doing well, Kindly excuse me for the delay as my laptop was updating, 

Are you ready for the session?
01/11/23, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Thenjiwe, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
02/11/23, 8:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
02/11/23, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Thenjiwe, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
