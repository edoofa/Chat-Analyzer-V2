19/12/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Lindokuhle, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
19/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 904 5337: Yes indeed I have researched about foreign education but never applied am waiting to finish my A level as I feel it is a very important step in education before one goes to tertiary
19/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 904 5337: Well understood @917982048840

19/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 904 5337: Thank you ✅ I guess I had not given much thought to scam artists but my parents where concerned
19/12/23, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand!
19/12/23, 9:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

19/12/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Lindokuhle, But you have mentioned that you were interested in Business. And also, Note that If you aspire to pursue Actuarial Science and ACCA, opting for a BCom (Bachelor of Commerce) is a recommended path. BCom provides a strong foundation in business and finance, aligning well with the knowledge and skills required for Actuarial Science and ACCA. The coursework typically covers subjects like accounting, finance, and economics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the business environment.

Moreover, many Actuarial Science and ACCA programs require a background in commerce, making BCom an ideal choice. The interdisciplinary approach of BCom equips you with the quantitative and analytical skills essential for these fields. It lays the groundwork for a seamless transition into specialized programs, providing a well-rounded education that complements the intricacies of Actuarial Science and ACCA.
