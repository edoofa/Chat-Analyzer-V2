20/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 019 1419: Yes
20/12/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
20/12/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 019 1419: Yes l am confident
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
20/12/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with what motivates you to study Accounting and finance for your higher education?
