You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
20/12/23, 10:13 am - +27 68 272 6969: My apologies where your prospective student Shaun is now and her Mother there are struggling with network , so what are the requirements for enrollment
20/12/23, 10:17 am - +27 68 272 6969: Shaun is waiting for Cambridge university A level results coming out in January or early February
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Since currently we have just begun with the counseling session,

I shall discuss everything in detail.
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
20/12/23, 10:19 am - +27 68 272 6969: Thank you
20/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Musendo, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Musendo better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
20/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 68 272 6969: First and foremost Me and Shaun's mother, we don't stay together but we want the best for our son .
I am a qualified Electrician, National certificate in electrical power engineering obtained in 1999 and his mother has executive secretarial course . Having grown up in a family where education was not prioritised I realised the importance of education when I became a first generation student. I am testament of how education can change your life .Without it  I doubt if I was going to be able to soldier on to support him to reach this stage of sitting for A level exams, a family milestone.

Having witnessed many people succumb to lack of technical knowledge for  example layman electrician electrocuted because of lack of basic knowledge , I don't want the same fate for my son.I believe tertiary education equips you  with most skills needed to navigate the rough path of life , Apparently Edoofa scholarship program will equip you with these important skills while ensuring that you are ahead of counterparts
20/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Musendo, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - +27 68 272 6969: The pleasure is mine, Thank you
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: By when shall I expect to hear from Mrs Plaxedes please?
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Anytime soon when She is where the network is available, definitely she will communicate and I do appreciate
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, may I know Shaun better as a student,

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies please?
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - +27 68 272 6969: There is a problem with electricity where they are staying , phone off ,not charged that is why I can't get hold of them, I am so stressed now
20/12/23, 4:03 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:09 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
20/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Received please, I can see he received great remarks from his teachers!
20/12/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: So what exactly would he like to study for his higher education in India, Mr Musendo?
20/12/23, 4:21 pm - +27 68 272 6969: BSc/MIDR medical imaging (diagnostic radiography)
20/12/23, 4:25 pm - +27 68 272 6969: 2nd preference civil engineering
3rd computer science majoring in artificial intelligence
20/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mr Musendo.

Considering the first interest in Medicine,

May I know why he didn't pursue Biology in his A level please?
20/12/23, 4:44 pm - +27 68 272 6969: It was me who made him, to drop biology for physics
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - +27 68 272 6969: He did Maths, physics and chemistry
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Having shared the same, he is eligible for Civil Engineering as well.
20/12/23, 5:38 pm - +27 68 272 6969: He did biology at ordinary level
20/12/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

However here in India, A level subjects are a primary requirement.
20/12/23, 5:41 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Okay
20/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
20/12/23, 5:44 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Yes I did, tomorrow Shaun will be available for career guidance
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mr Musendo.

So far, do you have any queries for me?
20/12/23, 5:46 pm - +27 68 272 6969: The scholarship is it, 100% funded
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of 100% funded please?
20/12/23, 5:49 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Does the scholarship cover tuition fees, accommodation, food, medical and travel expenses
20/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
20/12/23, 5:55 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Thank you for letting me know the difference and with his A level combination is he eligible for Computer science
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

Yes please, he is eligible, Mr Musendo.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Tomorrow Shaun will be in the place where the network is available and we'll continue with our conversation and hear from him what he wants to do, thank you very much for your time and patience
20/12/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: The discussion for tomorrow is scheduled at 9 AM CAT
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:12 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Shaun you may chat with Ms Harmehak we have been waiting for you
20/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I already did
