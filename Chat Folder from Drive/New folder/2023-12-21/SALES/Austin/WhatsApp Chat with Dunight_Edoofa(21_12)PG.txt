*I am Mr Austin, Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa and we also have with us Mr Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions and Ms Pallika, Career Counselor at Edoofa.* 

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student *Vincent*
20/12/23, 10:31 pm - Austin: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow afternoon at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counselling session so that we can process your application
20/12/23, 10:31 pm - Austin: Since you *have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Valerie, please reach out to your friend* to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
