20/12/23, 10:31 pm - Austin: Since you *have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Valerie, please reach out to your friend* to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
