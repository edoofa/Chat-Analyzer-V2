25/10/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin?
25/10/23, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Ncube, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
25/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 945 7065: Ok am sorry for replying using this number my data bundles had been depleted
25/10/23, 11:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please acknowledge this.

25/10/23, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know how?
25/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 945 7065: The Edoofians are given opportunities to work in organisations from across the world to reduce their fees and they also earn scholarship credits .
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
25/10/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
25/10/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
25/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Yes l do think l will benefit . The EWYL programme would help me because after l finish my course ,l will already have experience that will improve my skills and l will be able to showcase my abilities.Also as the brochure says ,the EWYL programme gives students time to improve their leadership skills as they are given opportunities to lead projects . The EWYL programme would benefit me as l will be able to earn scholarship credits which would help me reduce my fees  everytime l am awarded .
25/10/23, 7:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
25/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Ok thank you l hear you ma'am
25/10/23, 9:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Ok ma'am l won't be available at 1130 tomorrow

26/10/23, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
26/10/23, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please note that your parents can have the session on your behalf
26/10/23, 8:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin?
27/10/23, 8:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Mbalenhle, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
29/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Greetings l am so sorry for not responding on time . My cellphone was giving me problems but l hope l can still take the next step .l am ready if you are available
30/10/23, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
30/10/23, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand that!!!
30/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Thank you for understanding
We shall begin
30/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 945 7065: I hear you ma'am it's quite affordable 
So l want to know,does Edoofa give you assurance that you will be selected before paying $750
30/10/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, of course, Mbalenhle, You will have to pay the enrollment fees of $350 once you are selected and after you receive your acceptance letter.
30/10/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain this too
30/10/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
30/10/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/10/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
30/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Ok 
That is completely understandable 
It is indeed affordable
30/10/23, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!
30/10/23, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Cycle4
30/10/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Mbalenhle,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
30/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Yes go ahead
30/10/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
30/10/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
30/10/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
30/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 945 7065: I am clear with the process.thabk you
30/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Thank
30/10/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mbalenhle, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
30/10/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

31/10/23, 11:25 am - Austin: I do understand the challenges and concerns and am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. May I know if your family has any queries, please

31/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 945 7065: They think it is quite affordable as compared to other countries like Germany and USA which cost around 30000 to 40000 per year.

31/10/23, 12:02 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
31/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 945 7065: Ok 
I would be studying Law

5.200 can be paid in 7 days ànd the remaining 150 is paid in 30 days
6.The EWYL is a hands on programme where students are given opportunities to participate in projects that will help them to be employable.It also requires dedication and commitment as students are given deadlines and they are obliged to meet those deadlines . This dedication helps students earn scholarship credits not in physical cash but it is a way to reduce their tuition fees . Also the EWYL programme gives students time to be up to date with today's technology as they will be doing digital marketing and so on Also the programme is done during non exam times not exacting pressure on students when it's examination time

10/11/23, 10:37 am - Austin: Yes please, 
There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
10/11/23, 10:37 am - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
10/11/23, 10:37 am - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

10/11/23, 10:46 am - Austin: This is well noted @263782096774 ,
If we begin with the eligibility check stage of Mbalenhle, tomorrow, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means, if she qualifies, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee would fall towards the end of next week or on the 4th week of November. Are you comfortable with this timeframe?
10/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 209 6774: As long i will be given  a months notice i will be comfortable because im self employed
10/11/23, 11:06 am - Austin: I do understand the challenges and holding for long would be a challenge as we have so many students in waiting for their turns for counselling and evaluations. Considering them,  if I request a payment plan for you to our Academic Board in such a way that you can pay $100 in seven days and the remaining $100 before the month's end if Mbalenhle qualifies for the Edoofa scholarship program, do you think it will be feasible for you?
