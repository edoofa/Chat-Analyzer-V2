14/09/23, 3:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Marvellous, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbia, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to Galgotias in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday
📅 28/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
11/10/23, 1:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Marvellous!

This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled video call session on Saturday.

16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:39 am - +260 97 9023317: Alright so 
All the form I shared with you 
You still have them ?

20/10/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Certainly, a student's eligibility for a 100% scholarship is contingent on several key factors. These factors include the quality of their Statement of Purpose (SoP), academic performance, engagement in extracurricular activities, any relevant work experiences, the strength of recommendation letters, and their responses during counseling sessions. The combination of these elements often plays a crucial role in determining whether a student qualifies for a full scholarship.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 92892 39087: Sure
15/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 92892 39087: Yes ma’am
15/11/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Marvellous, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 92892 39087: Alright ma’am
15/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share your progress on the $300 plan?
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 92892 39087: Am still working on it as I said yesterday in my country that’s when they’re writing exams so after they’re done that’s when I can get access to them
15/11/23, 2:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But  may I know how will you be spreading your word about Edoofa to them?
15/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 92892 39087: Most of them I have their contacts and through them I shall display information about edoofa
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great, also I heard from our senior Program Director that exams in Zambia are already over just the exams of some special subjects are left.
15/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 92892 39087: Yes 
But for all its will be done on Friday
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But for most of them whose exams are done, have you started talking to them?
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 92892 39087: Most of them finished today
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So will you be reaching out one on one or in groups?
15/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 92892 39087: One on one
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

22/11/23, 5:57 pm - +91 92892 39087: You’ll send the link of the meeting?
23/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Friendly Reminder*🚨:

Our session is scheduled for today from *07:00 PM to 08:00 PM IST or 03:30 PM to 04:30 PM Zambian Time* in the *EWYL Group*. During this time, we'll be discussing the grant guidelines. Your active presence is highly valued, and I'm confident that your focused attention, as well as the participation of your parents, will greatly contribute to our conversation
23/11/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the EWYL Group only.
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - +91 92892 39087: Alright
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 92892 39087: Yes
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 92892 39087: Yes have gone through
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please share in depth what you have understood from it?
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 92892 39087: I was given a grant of $.300 which will be applied only in second semesters and it’s up to me to choose whether I’ll go with the grant or the $300 for the project whichever will be in large amount.
And also if a student is studying a course of four to five years then their grant are being raised from $500 for which they’ll be paying 500$ and the other $500 will be carters by the edoofa
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing Marvellous!
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 92892 39087: Absolutely
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago?
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 92892 39087: Yes
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 92892 39087: Thank you ma’am
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 92892 39087: Sure ma’am

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know on how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
