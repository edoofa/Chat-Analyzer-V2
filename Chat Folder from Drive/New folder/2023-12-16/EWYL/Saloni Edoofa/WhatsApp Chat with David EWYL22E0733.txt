Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/08/23, 2:29 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: With the help of your explanation about the two objectives I know them better since am just back from school where I was so busy preparing myself for MSCE exams that made me not to have much time to read and know much about the two objectives of EDOOFA.

11/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have got the idea of it perfectly and let me add to your knowledge on the same.
11/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/08/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

11/08/23, 3:07 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Thanks so much for re-emphsising the two goals, I have a clearer picture now and can work towards them.

15/08/23, 10:31 am - +265 993 58 12 14: "INDEPENDENCE WISHES"
Good morning Saloni, special greetings and wishes for you, family, colleagues,  relatives and all the people  of India as you celebrate your country's birth/independence day today.  Yes India is the major driving force for everything (Socio-economic,  political and IT development) today as for example, top IT (CEO of google is from India- correct me please and top medical experts) are from India. Malawians in need critical medical services come to India for  treatment. Yes, Edoofa is well placed as it seeks to bridge the gap the Indian government and community.  Edoofa  promotes and provides affordable and employable education standards all over the world because the cost of education has gone comparatively high for vulnerable/poor and yet gifted individuals. Edoofa is bringing this gap to develop the world. For all these reasons I wish you a warm celebration in style as you remember your independence day today.
15/08/23, 11:59 am - +265 998 43 95 28: Happy independence day🥳

You like young minds ot young people especially seeing them successful in life. Your experience to support this process by guiding and easing communication. You are a global and social worker, interacting with young minds to reach their satisfaction.  Young kids who are curious to learn by dedicating themselves to meet their targets. Together we can.

17/08/23, 3:52 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Although late, connection was a problem. 
Thanks so much for sharing this very encouraging news letter. In the first place, there are encouraging words by the founder  thanks be to him . 
Secondly there two interesting quotations highlighting courage as the epicentre of success,  it means I should be prepared to achieve my goal whether  I fail or not but that I should remain focused. 
On second quote, I should love what I do. Courage diminishes fear and where is a will there is a way. So this is a call for me to work hard.
On the two questions:
I have understood that discipline and self will help me to remain focussed and lastly, by prioritising what I have decided to do will help me not to be distracted. 
Finally I have read the inspirations of Edoofians which I appreciate very much. Thanks
18/08/23, 2:13 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Sounds perfect and loving

18/08/23, 2:20 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: The three goals are real. I need to plan things that relate to my education in India. I now understand that I need to prepare myself for the future in all aspects.  The EWYL programme is good because it will help my parents to support me better. In all that I do I should remember the goal. Thank you, it sounds great.

21/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

How are you?

May we begin with our session📖
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Yes we can
22/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are you late for the session?
22/08/23, 2:10 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: I was out of bundle, sorry
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay I understand that now.
22/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you read the document?
22/08/23, 2:14 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Thanks
22/08/23, 2:14 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Yes
22/08/23, 2:21 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Hello
22/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. David- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
22/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sorry for the delay, I had an urgent call.
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: It's alright
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: This document is very important for my future. First of all,  it talks about awareness and acquiring skills which are necessary for addressing any bad situation. The skills are divided into permanent or enduring  and emerging skills.  The enduring skills are about relationship building,  networking,  business development, decision making, risk taking and empathy  while emerging skills talk about sudden changes such as covid 19 situation.  I see people having virtual meetings/conferences.
I have read about two projects which Edoofa EWYL programme (Affordability,  Accessibility & Employability).
On project 1, we have primary outcomes, skills and mindset ( reaching out to others). Under this programme,  students identify local organisations/companies,  decision makers,  arrange for videos. 
There are five activities that support the first project. 
Project two want to build community people. There are also outcomes,  skills and mindset. Outcomes mean to reach out to others and communities.
23/08/23, 1:29 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Hello
23/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
23/08/23, 1:42 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Yes we can begin
23/08/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have summed it up really well🌟
23/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/08/23, 1:48 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Thank you very much
23/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 1:48 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: OK sure I wil
23/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you listen to the audio, do let me know.
23/08/23, 1:59 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: OK sure
23/08/23, 2:00 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: I have listened to it
23/08/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/08/23, 2:11 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: What's the name of the document you're talking about I didn't get it
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will share the document once you will share what you have learned from the audio.
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: What I have heard from the audio is about the networking program were by there are some companies that do that depending on technology. The simplest way of networking is about family members, neighbours, head of department and I have got the information that I'll be connected to influential people that will help me to networking to get my credibility and with their help and the help of this country and that country over there we can.
23/08/23, 2:35 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: The audio is also about the first project called Cooperate Alliance, and the objective of it is to give an understanding of the markets and also preparing for the future.
Looking at the world which is technologically driven, I need to start with my family members to find markets in the region and my country.
The audio says that I should use Lindlin to search for companies, managers to start conversations
23/08/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

24/08/23, 2:26 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: OK I will madam
24/08/23, 2:39 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: First of all,there are several factors when looking for right companies.1 Nature of company.The nature of the company must be either student centric, recreational or content centric platform. Eg, Ed-tech platforms, recreational platforms and content centric platform.

Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

25/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, this how the scholarship credits will be given.

There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*

29/08/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'll see you on *Thursday* from 01:30-02:30 PM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 4:52 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Waoh this is wonderful , we do not have such type of celebration here in Malawi . This idea of celebrating the bond between brother and sister is  great.
29/08/23, 4:54 pm - +265 998 93 64 73: Wishing a happy Raksha Bandham festival💐💐💐
31/08/23, 1:33 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Hello miss Saloni
31/08/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed it is the most lovely idea!
31/08/23, 1:41 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Am fine and you miss Saloni, this is so wonderful🤩 to hear thanks so much
31/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
31/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy that you liked it, I especially got these picture for you since I found you a bit excited than other students🙈
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: 😁😅that's so nice of you, thanks so much 🙏🏼🤝
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: You are welcome
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this David, And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
31/08/23, 2:16 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Actually I got this from the second audio you shared with me which you sent last time .Thanks so much for clarifying it again
31/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Welcome David!
31/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
31/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*David/Saloni/31AUG2023*
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
01/09/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: OK I wil madam
01/09/23, 3:25 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Thanks so much

18/09/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/09/23, 2:24 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Monday to Thursday 👍🏻
18/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!

18/09/23, 2:28 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Done

24/10/23, 11:19 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: The newsletter is interesting in many ways.  The founder is challenging Edoofians in the quotes and questions.  
Before the newsletter, the founder he compares significant and successful . That it is important not expect any returns
24/10/23, 11:20 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: There are so many challenges in life and one needs to be prepared for the future.
24/10/23, 11:20 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: In life we need to be prepared to face challenges. Such as ; 
1 lack resources related to one's education. 
2 financial hardships.
3 lack of encouragement from friends etc.

We need to be prepared for this.
We need to deliver value before we can claim any monetary benefits.
24/10/23, 11:21 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: If today one sits   under a tree, it means someone else or indeed parents planted a tree.

As David I align myself to Henry's   thinking you value everyone equally and this leads to acceptance by all. We should look at the value of people first before any monetary claims.

Secondly,  professionally and humanly speaking,  respect for all is important.  This is complementary. I am sure that this is also the thinking of the founder of Edoofa. In summary this is my take from the freshly brewed newsletter, thank you.
25/10/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon David and parents!
How are you doing?
25/10/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in responding. Yesterday, the entire organization was occupied in celebrating Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥

1. By daily rituals you mean reciting the slogan of Edoofa?
2. How can I attach one project to each daily ritual?
3. How do you connect the projects to earlier discussions,  it is the same or I can pick any subject under my field?
4. Network is sometimes on and off, 

Thanks for helping me out on these points.

09/11/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
09/11/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will now have our session on Tuesday from 12:00-01:30 PM.

16/11/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello and good afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. How are you doing today?

I'm thrilled about our session on the EWYL Line happening right now! It's a fantastic opportunity for us to dive into our Wednesday lesson, share our thoughts, and, most importantly, make steady progress on our projects together.

What are you most excited to discuss or work on during our session? Your input is key, and I'm looking forward to a dynamic and engaging conversation.
16/11/23, 12:14 pm - +265 998 43 95 28: Afternoon glad that you are fine.
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.
