07/08/23, 1:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am thrilled to be your mentor.  Before connecting with you today, I  reviewed your applications and gathered feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
07/08/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Yes . I hope I won't disappoint you
07/08/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am sure you won’t disappoint me.
07/08/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India.
Let me share a short clip about myself.
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video. <This message was edited>
07/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 312 9701: ok
07/08/23, 2:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 312 9701: thank for the video , I am done watching
07/08/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
07/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 312 9701: yes
07/08/23, 2:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
07/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 312 9701: for now I don't have any challenges with the time but when I have them I will inform you
07/08/23, 2:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.
This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
07/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 312 9701: ok understood
07/08/23, 2:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
-
07/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 312 9701: I am sorry for late replies , I am having some network challenges
07/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 312 9701: No I don't understand
07/08/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
07/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok thank you I now understand
07/08/23, 3:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
07/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 312 9701: we may proceed
07/08/23, 3:12 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tafadzwa?
07/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 312 9701: it sounds great
07/08/23, 3:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
07/08/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 312 9701: yes , we can carry on
07/08/23, 3:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
07/08/23, 3:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 312 9701: you were right they are interesting
07/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 312 9701: I enjoyed reading it
07/08/23, 3:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
07/08/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 312 9701: the last section "EDOOFA HALL OF INSIRATION" was more interesting but the remaining were great
07/08/23, 4:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
07/08/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 312 9701: yes l hope so
07/08/23, 4:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
*Are you ready for the questions?*
07/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 312 9701: yes
07/08/23, 4:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube
4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
07/08/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 312 9701: 1.Ms. Deepali is the Head of Department, Ms. Davi is the Head coach and my Mentor is Tenzin
2.To use her experience to  give me advise support and answer any question I have and to ensure that I'm growing and developing with each discussion we have
3.A

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

11/08/23, 1:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am good, Thank you.
11/08/23, 1:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/08/23, 1:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

11/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 312 9701: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 3:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tafadzwa, You need to type the understanding and share so that we can keep a record.
11/08/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
11/08/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 312 9701: The task is to look for the potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for the Edoofa Programme.                                                                           The chosen companies must be a worthwhile company and the following factors are considered for the company                                                                                i) The nature of company  must be either student-centric that prioritize the needs of the student in every process and piece of advice including career development or it could be recreational.                                                                                  ii) The  scale of the company must be too big or small , the number of employees must be between(50-200)                         iii) The company must be also   financially stable                                                                                                                               iv) The company founder must have a good background which include experience and knowledge                                                        2)After getting a few details regarding the nature of the company, I must start studying a little 
more about the company & its functioning.                                                                                                                        3) Also one of the most important steps is to study the website of the company. A 
careful study of the website can gives a brief information regarding the founders and the 
core members of the company (this can be found usually in Team members tab on 
website)
4) Also checking the various social media pages of the company
(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). This can give me an idea of the activities and 
functioning status of the company.                                                                                                                                                      5) Understanding and studying the background of the founder and 
other core members. For that purpose, the best source is to use LinkedIn and simply 
search for the name of the founder.                                                                                                                                                      6)After checking the background of people associated with the company, I must start reaching out 
to them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request. I should prefer 
to first reach out to the heads of various departments, for eg: Marketing managers, 
Community managers etc before connecting with the founders of the company.
12/08/23, 7:57 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

17/08/23, 2:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am good, Thank you.
17/08/23, 2:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it
17/08/23, 2:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 312 9701: How about the last project I should connect the company employees with edoofa right
17/08/23, 2:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, But do not work on that project now.
17/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
17/08/23, 2:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you are done listening?
17/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 312 9701: In audio format
17/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Community building is a project that is directed towards the creation or enhancement of community among individuals within a regional area or with a common interest.
The goal of the project is to bring people together , creating togetherness and platform for social change .
The primary outcome is for students to reach out their personal and extended networks and  offer them  an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's  program which prepares them for the future.
This helps us to have networking skills , persuasion skills.
Students must reach  out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools recently or the past 6 months and refer them to Edoofa programm.
17/08/23, 2:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am happy with your understanding!
Let us connect tomorrow.
I hope you have a nice day.
17/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Thank you
18/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
18/08/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
18/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
18/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Should I add you to the group
18/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Tafadzwa.
18/08/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
18/08/23, 2:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
18/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 312 9701: So this will be the name of the group or
18/08/23, 2:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, This will be tha name.
18/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
18/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
18/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
18/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok understood
18/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/08/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
22/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
22/08/23, 2:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!




Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌


_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.


The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

31/08/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Tafadzwa- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
31/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 312 9701: For now I don't have.
We can move on
31/08/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
31/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 312 9701: yes
31/08/23, 2:12 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

05/09/23, 4:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: There won't be a session tomorrow as I'll be at the airport to receive the students. It's going to be a great experience. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

08/09/23, 12:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon!
I hope you are well. I would like to reschedule today's session to 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm. Please follow your ritual on the line.
08/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 328 6917: Thats ok Tenzin. Tafadzwa will get in touch
08/09/23, 6:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let us begin our session.
08/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
08/09/23, 6:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Ok
08/09/23, 6:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
08/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 312 9701: We may continue
08/09/23, 6:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
08/09/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 312 9701: Thank you
09/09/23, 9:05 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I hope this message finds you well. I would like you to come to the line to collect your newsletter by following your proud Edoofian ritual.  Our team has put together some exciting updates and information that we think you'll find valuable.
26/09/23, 10:17 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

Your session has already started on your EWYL Line, and I am quite disappointed with the fact that I always have to share a reminder with you to join your session. Can I know, is it that difficult to follow your schedule?
