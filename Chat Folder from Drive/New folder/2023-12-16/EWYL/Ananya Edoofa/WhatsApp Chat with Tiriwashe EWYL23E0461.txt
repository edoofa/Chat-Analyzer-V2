01/08/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely. Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
01/08/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

01/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 503 7640: Okay noted thanks
01/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

Greetings to yu all, Ms Deepali and Ms Davi
01/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

04/08/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
04/08/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience.

This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
04/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and to support each other on your journey to success.
So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay noted thank you

08/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Good afternoon Ms Ananya. I'm having network problems but I will try to visit the site
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay

Questions
1. What does the edoofa scholarship program deals with in detail

2. What is your understanding about the Earn while you learn program offered by the the edoofa scholarship program

3.what are the benefits of EWYL program

4.what makes edoofa a special scholarship program as compared to other scholarship program
08/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay noted
08/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay thank you noted
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process by asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay understood
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Step 1
Search for potential and interested students from social media like Facebook WhatsApp andf from friends and parents and from my former high school students

Stage 2
Explaining about the edoofa program in detail
And answer their questions
Stage 3
Check for student eligibility by asking them questions related to edoofa scholarship program

Stage 4,
If I found the eligible, I will send them an application form to fill

Stage 5,
I will send the filled form to my mentor in EWYL group
08/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Thank you Ms Ananya
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 503 7640: Okay noted
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

26/11/23, 2:03 pm - +91 86849 25366: The spirit of competition refers to the mindset and attitude adopted by individuals or groups when engaging in competitive activities. It encompasses the values, principles, and behaviors that drive people to participate, excel, and push their limits in pursuit of victory or success. While competition can vary across different contexts, such as sports, academics, or business, the spirit of competition generally involves qualities such as determination, resilience, perseverance, and a desire to improve and outperform others.

The influence of the spirit of competition on goals can be significant. Here are a few ways in which it can impact goals:

1. Setting ambitious goals: The competitive environment often prompts individuals or groups to set challenging and ambitious goals. The desire to surpass rivals or achieve a higher level of performance can inspire individuals to aim higher and strive for excellence.

2. Motivation and focus: Competition can serve as a powerful motivator. The presence of competitors and the drive to outperform them can fuel individuals' motivation to work harder, practice more, and dedicate themselves to their goals. It helps individuals stay focused on their objectives and maintain a high level of effort and commitment.

3. Continuous improvement: The spirit of competition fosters a mindset of continuous improvement. When individuals compete against others who are equally skilled or even better, it pushes them to analyze their weaknesses, identify areas for growth, and seek ways to enhance their performance. The pursuit of victory or success drives individuals to constantly refine their skills and strategies, leading to personal growth and development.

4. Resilience and perseverance: Competition often involves setbacks, failures, and challenges. However, the spirit of competition instills resilience and perseverance in individuals. The desire to overcome obstacles, bounce back from defeats, and keep striving for success helps individuals maintain their focus on their goals, even in the face of adversity.

5. Collaboration and teamwork: While competition is often associated with individual achievements, it can also foster collaboration and teamwork. In team-based competitions, individuals learn to work together, leverage each other's strengths, and coordinate efforts towards a common goal. The spirit of competition can enhance goal alignment, promote cooperation, and drive collective success.

6. Goal refinement and adaptation: Competing against others can provide valuable insights and feedback. Observing the strengths and strategies of competitors can help individuals refine their goals, adjust their approaches, and identify new opportunities for growth. The spirit of competition encourages individuals to evaluate their goals in light of their performance and make necessary adjustments to stay
26/11/23, 2:03 pm - +91 86849 25366: The spirit of competition has played a pivotal role in my life as it influenced my goals to be successful individual . Back in High School in Zimbabwe the best students  academics where give prices in form of laptops ,books , instruments . So the competition was established as every students aim to get an award and I also  embarked in the competition which also improved my researching skills, reading skills and my critical thinking .


In High school there were music competitions where students or group of students compete in choir , singing , dancing and playing musical instruments like marimba . These competitions motivated us to work hard and practice playing instruments so that we can be able to win the competition. This ambition to win competition awards helped in shaping me into a better producer and taught me that nothing comes from just sitting or resting . Meaning THERE IS NO SHORTCUT TO SUCCESS , ONE HAVE TO WORK HARD FOR EVERYTHING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUAL .

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:36 pm - +91 86849 25366: A cloud
09/12/23, 4:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I hope you have not googled it!🤣
09/12/23, 4:40 pm - +91 86849 25366: Kkk no Ms Ananya
09/12/23, 4:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - +91 86849 25366: Okay that’s great Ms
09/12/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 4:51 pm - +91 86849 25366: Patience
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - +91 86849 25366: Oh wow that amazing 
LinkedIn platform really change his life for the better
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
09/12/23, 4:55 pm - +91 86849 25366: Yes noted Ms
09/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
09/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.

This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

*Activity Instructions:*

⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). 

Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
