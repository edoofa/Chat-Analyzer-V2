11/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Tawananyasha!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Okay thank you
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Two objectives of EWYL is to earn maximum scholarship credits so as to reduce the cost of higher education .This will make it affordable.

Then also to make sure that students are  employable  after completing higher education.That is they meet the world's standards required  by employers.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Thank you  for expanding the objectives ,I am following as well.
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Welcome Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana ,we happy to have you on board and travel this journey together.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Thank you I understand
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Yh it does sound very much interesting
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights!

12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Good afternoon
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: I’m excited for the session we can start
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Me too but I enjoyed the section entitled two questions for u the most
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 575 1120: It sounds great actually
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 575 1120: What I have noticed is that EWYL really equips you to a better person as you will acquire skills that are not offered by other programs
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 575 1120: You are able to support yourself even financially
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Tawananyasha!
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Yes it is

12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Not yet the book is quite big

13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Alright
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 575 1120: I learnt a lot from the document but let me just give you a summary of what I learnt 

Firstly, I learnt that EWYL program ensures you acquire emerging skills ( which came up due to the COVID 19 ) and also the enduring skills that will improve my way of thinking and my degree of creativity 

From Project 1 , it was quite interesting to find out that I will be exposed to various companies and acquire the skill of networking not only that but communication skills that will help me reach out to the companies and I was also glad to hear that team Edoofa will be helping me with the procedures as well . I also found out that they are scholarship credits that are offered for this project which is quite motivating for me to put more effort 

From project 2, I was glad to learn that I will also be given the opportunity to reach out to other students about this Edoofa scholarship which will also improve my networking skills and persuasion skills which is a very vital skill required in most companies . I also came to a realization that I’d also be getting scholarship credit as well which is very exciting 

From project 3,I like the idea of reaching out to local schools sharing about Edoofa as well especially to those who also need financial help like me and I liked the idea that team Edoofa will be helping me through all of this
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 575 1120: All in all I found EWYL to be quite luring because the skills I will acquire will help me even when I’m getting a job after I am done with my studies
13/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Okay thank you
13/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
13/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Okay let me do so right away
13/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 575 1120: I have understood that before I have reached out to any company I should firstly research on it by checking 
1 the nature of the company 
2 the scale of the company 
4 the financial stability of the company 
5 the background of the founder 

And there where of platforms or websites that were given so that I could use for my research such as LinkedIn and I could also look for them on social media platforms to see how they work and if they are safe for me to approach and if I am done with my thorough research that is when I would reach out to that company
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion. I have been facing some technical challenges today!

However, don't worry; everything will be resolved by tomorrow, and we will move ahead. See you tomorrow! 🌟
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Okay thank you
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Good afternoon
14/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Very interesting

Unfortunately I won’t be available during session time I’ll be back by evening but may you still send me the work for today and I’ll attend to it when I come back 

Thank you
15/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

Thank you for informing me, let me share the certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
15/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
