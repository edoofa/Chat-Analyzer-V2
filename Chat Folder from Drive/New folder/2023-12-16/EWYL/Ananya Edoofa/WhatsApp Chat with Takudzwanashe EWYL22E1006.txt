08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 8:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Takudzwanashe!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 11:02 am - +91 89687 76354: Noted.
25/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
29/11/23, 7:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈
29/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Takudzwanashe!

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Let us begin our EWYL Group session_

I would appreciate an explanation for why you were unable to attend our scheduled session. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
02/12/23, 9:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: _*Saturday Activity*_

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:14 pm - +91 89687 76354: A cloud
09/12/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Takudzwanashe, can I know why are you late?
09/12/23, 4:23 pm - +91 89687 76354: I was at church
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Takudzwanashe, I really appreciate your dedication however we only met once a week, don't you think you could have rescheduled your other work and attended your sessions instead?
09/12/23, 4:33 pm - +91 89687 76354: I think it's better if we minimize the number of sessions in order to accommodate other activities of mine including school work.
09/12/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It's just that we connect only once a week, and that too late in the evening after all your classes. Even after that, you are not attending your sessions; it's an alarming situation for me.
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - +91 89687 76354: Do not be alarmed Ma'am I'm fine.
09/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Takudzwanashe, if your visit to the church was scheduled, then why didn't you inform be earlier? 

I could have rescheduled your session.
09/12/23, 5:01 pm - +91 89687 76354: Sorry Ma'am.
09/12/23, 5:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 5:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect for a call next Saturday. Meanwhile, I am sharing your Saturday activity with you.
09/12/23, 5:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟
