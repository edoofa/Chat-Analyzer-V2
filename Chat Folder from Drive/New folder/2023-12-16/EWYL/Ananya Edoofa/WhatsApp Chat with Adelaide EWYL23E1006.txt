13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 653 1903: The afternoon session 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm is perfect
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sure
13/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Here's to the beginning of a beautiful journey together 🥂. I'm sure I'll enjoy the experience
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Thanks for the introduction. Looking forward to a fruitful working relationship
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
13/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: So... I'm Adelaide Takura Sithole, and I'm an aspiring chemical engineer. I'm all about breaking stereotypes and have chosen to break the bias by joining a male dominated field. I'm an avid reader, writer and researcher. I am a passionate speaker and yeah....
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Adelaide! 🌟 
That's awesome – breaking stereotypes and diving into a male-dominated field takes serious guts. Big respect! 🚀 Chemical engineering sounds fascinating. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am very excited to begin our EWYL Hourney together. So let us connect on Friday!🌟🤝🏽
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright.  I'll be here
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon miss. I am genuinely surprised by the fact
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 653 1903: No I do not
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Ok. Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Very interesting
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Its pretty interesting
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: The Quotes
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright. Have a blessed weekend
