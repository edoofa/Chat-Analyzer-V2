18/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?

18/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 220 7028: No
18/09/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Salama is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.

I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to come for the scheduled so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?

I have observed your inactivity in the session and may I know what is the challenge exactly?
Let’s begin with today's session.
10/10/23, 10:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented Every Wednesday.

Every Wednesday, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. starting from tomorrow*
11/10/23, 1:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Salama!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 220 7028: Greetings  how are you
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking.
11/10/23, 1:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.

Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
11/10/23, 1:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
11/10/23, 1:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 220 7028: Yes
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
12/10/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Student!
It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
