I hope you are doing really well.

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. Given that you will be keeping busy the examination I want you to complete the fast-track EWYL training session which will not take more than 2 days if attended regularly.
These sessions can also be attended by your parents on our behalf.

During these sessions, I will share a procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

Do let me know if we can get started with the sessions from today onwards.
19/10/23, 3:57 am - +263 78 094 0477: Will surely do maam thank you
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Makanaka!

20/10/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well!

Please note that the following schedule will be implemented from today onwards.
*Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*

*No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.*
23/10/23, 11:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Makanaka
I hope you had a wonderful weekend. 

I would like to inform you that Due to an urgent meeting, I need to *reschedule our today's session to 2:30 PM.*
Kindly be available for the same.
30/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Maam l hope l find you well, l did communicate for transparency to the admissions team that Manakana has opted for therapeutic radiotherapy and imaging and reasons for the choice were advanced to same. It became the sticking point as they retorted highlighting that they were unable to offer him the programme so it was in the best interest for all parties to wait for their final say so we have not yet got any favourable response,  simply put Makanaka has not been given the programme of his choice
01/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello *Makanaka*! 🌟

Let's kick off our regular session with a little inspiration:

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Lao Tzu

No matter where you are on your path, remember that every step you take today brings you closer to your goals. Let's make this session a productive and rewarding one together
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Good day ma'am
01/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 094 0477: I have an exam tomorrow in the PM so lm preparing for it hence the reason why l can't connect for the session today
01/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Makanaka, thank you for sharing your about your examination. I wish you all the very best for the same. 
Do let me know if your parents can join the session on your behalf. As your parents might have also signed a document with the admission team agreeing that they will be attending the sessions in case of your unavailability.
01/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Okay maam will do
02/11/23, 7:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Makanaka
I hope you are doing well.

I have an exciting update. I'll be visiting one of our partner colleges today, so we will not have our today's scheduled session. Please take this time in revising whatever we have discussed so far.
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Makanaka*
I hope you are doing well.

This is a gentle reminder that you have your EWYL Training session scheduled today from *1:30 pm*.

09/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Makanaka
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity.

15/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Makanaka*
In the spirit of our session today, I'd like to share this simple yet powerful quote: 'Believe you can, and you're halfway there.' – Theodore Roosevelt.

Let's make the most of our time together and inspire each other along the way.

I observed you were not available for our sessions for quite a long time, are you ready today?
I would also like to understand the reason behind your unavailability.
16/11/23, 7:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: _*Greetings for the day,*_

17/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Makanaka*

20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Sorry  maam Maka is writing   exams  so he must be in a revision  lesson  right now.We are also still waiting  for  the program  change  to be finalised  .
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 228 0605: Ok l hope l find you well, unfortunately Makanaka could not get his desired programme, making it difficult for him to continue the programme
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I appreciate your diligence in keeping me informed. It's completely understandable that Maka is currently occupied with exams and revision lessons.
Do let me know when will her examinations be ending. 

 Regarding the program change, Can you let me know the challenge exactly?
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 228 0605: Those in charge of programme allocation opted for other programmes, after Makanaka insisted on Therapeutic radiology and imaging technology, they never responded
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 228 0605: So the ball is still in their court
20/11/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay. I can completely understand that. In order to help me get a clear picture of the conversation, can you share the screenshot of the conversation with me?

Has there been an update on the change in program from our end?
14/12/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Good day 
Not yet ma'am
15/12/23, 1:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Makanatsa

Thank you for the update.

Picture this as your personal launchpad to success! Our session is all about turning your dreams into a vibrant reality, fueling your journey with purpose and action.
Get ready for a thrilling session of transformation and achievement!
15/12/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today without giving me any prior notice. I hope you understand how crucial these sessions are, and it's essential to be consistent in attending them.
I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
15/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 228 0605: Good afternoon sir, we apologise for the inconvenience but l thought we categorically made it crystal clear that it is only reasonable to continue with Edoofa if Makanaka is doing a programme of his choice as it stands he does not have a programme with Edoofa making the sessions purely academic and not beneficial to him as it is apparent he might not be able to continue with Edoofa because unfortunately he could not get a programme he desired which is not Edoofa's problem at all. Regrettably he cannot continue with sessions without a programme.
