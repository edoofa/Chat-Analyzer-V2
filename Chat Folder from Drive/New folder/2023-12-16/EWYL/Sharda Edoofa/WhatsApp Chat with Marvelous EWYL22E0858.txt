I'm truly *looking forward*to embarking on this journey together, and *your presence* is eagerly anticipated.

15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Marvelous

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 806 8210: Okay noted
16/09/23, 7:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well. Are you available for the session today?
16/09/23, 8:18 am - +263 71 806 8210: When is the session
16/09/23, 10:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you are doing well.

I have sent these options that you can choose according to your time availability.
16/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 806 8210: Now days I will be available at 7pm
16/09/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Marvelous

20/09/23, 2:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Marvelous
I hope you are doing well

Is it possible for you to attend the sessions at any of these timing:

20/09/23, 11:29 pm - +263 71 806 8210: Now days the pressure is due to exams coming on the next month
21/09/23, 1:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Marvelous

I understand your concern and that is why we have decided for an alternate in which your parents can attend the basic 3 day long training session for you and then we can put your program on hold until your exam get over.
21/09/23, 1:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly confirm the timing for the same?
22/09/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 806 8210: I understood but my parents are not online for a while

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. Given that you will be keeping busy the examination I want you to complete the fast-track EWYL training session which will not take more than 2 days if attended regularly.
These sessions can also be attended by your parents on our behalf.

During these sessions, I will share a procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

Do let me know if we can get started with the sessions from today onwards.
