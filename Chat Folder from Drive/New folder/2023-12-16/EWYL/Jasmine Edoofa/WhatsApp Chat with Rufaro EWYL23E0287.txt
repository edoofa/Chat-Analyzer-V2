29/08/23, 10:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The questions will be very easy. You will easily be able to verify if the student has understood or not.
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Alright ma'am
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 349 5674: We may proceed
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?

15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You can start working on this after the session and make sure you submit the questions by tomorrow.
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 349 5674: No problem ma'am, I will get it done
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:
15/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Alright
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: ▪️Start by introducing yourself, and providing your own introduction.

15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When answering the questions, you can refer to the training document I've provided. Please avoid copying and pasting the same messages.

May I know that are we on the same page?
15/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Yes we are we ma'am
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's regrettable that we couldn't finish our session today. We'll reconvene next week for our group call to resume the training.

It's time for the session. 

Quickly come and address your presence.
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Good evening ma'am, hope you're well this evening. My apologies for joining late
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Rufaro, I have numerous concerns to address with you. When we initially met, I held the assumption that you were one of my top students from Galgotias. However, our recent call has clearly contradicted that initial impression.
29/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 349 5674: I would like to express my deepest apologies for that ma'am, i know it was very unprofessional of me and i should not have let it happen. I assure you none of such sort will happen again.
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I accept it Rufaro
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We were in the midst of the training; let's finish that first.

29/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Crystal clear ma'am
29/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great. Now that you've wrapped up your training, a friendly face from our Student Welfare team will be in touch for your signature on the certificate. Once that's done, you'll officially be an Edoofa Certified Student Leader.

First up, we chatted about the $300 plan, right?
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Yes ma'am. You already did
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Then came the cool training about the 300$ plan, and congratulations, you're now an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader!* 🎓🌟
Are we on the same page?
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Yes ma'am
29/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Ma'am you're repeating everything we talked about
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I am summarising it
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's delve into the discussion about a platform truly rooted in the 21st century—a space cherished by professionals worldwide. Yep, I'm talking about *LinkedIn*
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Alright, I am aware of LinkedIn
29/11/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sure you must have heard about it. Could you kindly share what comes to mind when you think about LinkedIn? What's your take on this professional playground?
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 349 5674: I understand that it is a social media platform that various people use to share information on employment or internship opportunities. It is also a platform to advertise one's expertise or shall I say achievements and skills/qualities that one possess
29/11/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. 
Have a Good night
29/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Thank you ma'am, and have a good evening.
