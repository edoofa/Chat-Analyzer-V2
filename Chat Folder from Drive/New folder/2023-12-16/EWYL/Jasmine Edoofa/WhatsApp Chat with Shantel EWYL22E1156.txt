As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

I'm ready
17/08/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great. So Shantel we have paused your EWYL journey because I thought that you must be occupied with your visa and work but I have observed that you are coming to the sessions regularly. 

So do you want me to start your Earn While You Learn journey?
17/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 468 5131: Yes it's ok mam
We can start
17/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
17/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 468 5131: Clear
17/08/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?

17/08/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 468 5131: 2.The project number 1  is a corporate alliance is a type of strategic partnership between two or more companies. It's typically a way for the companies to share resources, knowledge, or technology, in order to achieve a common goal. For example,   Edoofa 
forms a corporate alliance with a company that provides schoolership and financial Aid.
17/08/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 468 5131: 3.Project 2 is showing that Community building with Edoofa is about creating a sense of connection and belonging among users of the platform. This could include creating groups for users based on shared interests, hosting virtual events, and providing opportunities for users to share their experiences and connect with others. Community building would help Edoofa become more than just a tool for finding educational opportunities. Instead, it would become a community of like-minded individuals who are all working towards a common goal.
17/08/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 468 5131: Project 3 which is the African Schools Education Reform Mission (ASERM) with Edoofa is about using Edoofa to support the goals of the ASERM initiative. The ASERM initiative is focused on improving educational outcomes for students in Africa. This could include improving access to quality education, increasing graduation rates, and reducing dropout rates. Edoofa could help with these goals by providing a platform for students to find quality educational opportunities. It could also help connect students with mentors, tutors, and other resources that can support their education.

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

During our visit, I promise to capture moments to share with you through pictures and updates. Until then, have a splendid and productive time, dear student!

Have a great time
08/09/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 468 5131: Good morning mam lm Currently busy with visa application can we postpone for next week
08/09/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Shantel. Do let me know when you will be done with your Visa.

14/09/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Shantel
How are you doing?
14/09/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions. Please feel free to discuss them with me.
14/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 468 5131: Hello mam

15/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Shantel, It's the time for our session. Are you available?

15/09/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -

15/09/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

22/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 468 5131: We did project 1 which is Community Building which includes submitting Students' details 
We also did African School Reform Program which is connecting Edoofa with African Schools
22/09/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great,  Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
22/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 468 5131: Noted ma'am
22/09/23, 10:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

22/09/23, 10:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].
I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
