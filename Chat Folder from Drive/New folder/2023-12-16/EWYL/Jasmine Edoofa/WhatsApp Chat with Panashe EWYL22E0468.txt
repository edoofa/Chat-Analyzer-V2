As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️
17/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263771008180 
I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 100 8180: Alright Ms.Jasmine
17/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 100 8180: Good Evening, Ms.Jasmine.
17/08/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
I hope you all are perfectly fine. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 100 8180: I am going to be offered the grant in my second semester. 
There are certain requirements for the grant such as 75% attendance. 

The grant will be directly paid to the school in installments usually during the time in which fees are to be paid.
17/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 100 8180: I have not yet had the time to read it throughly but i will
17/08/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Kindly read it now
17/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 100 8180: Alright let me
17/08/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 100 8180: Yes i am ready
17/08/23, 3:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 100 8180: I apologise Ms.Jasmine but i don't have a stable network.

23/08/23, 11:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263771008180 
I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. This is to inform you that students who come to India are offered some special benefits and now you are also one of them. _These benefits have been thoughtfully curated to alleviate the financial burden on both you and your beloved parents._

08/11/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,

23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.

25/11/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.

13/12/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

14/12/23, 12:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Panashe,*

I trust you're doing well. It was disheartening not to see you on the call yesterday. I want to emphasize that our meetings occur just once a week, and yesterday's call was scheduled for only 30 minutes. I believe it's reasonable to allocate at least 30 minutes from your week.
Moreover, I've noticed your absence from several recent sessions, and it's raising concerns about your commitment to the EWYL Program and earning credits. 

Do you want me to assume that you may not be as serious about it?
14/12/23, 3:01 pm - +91 6239 752 194: I talked to Mr.Sagar today and i will br more commited Ms.Jasmine

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only 15 days left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁
*Given that you've already secured eligibility for the grant, it's crucial to sustain that momentum throughout this month. Please ensure consistent participation by attending all sessions and calls.*

Now, I get it, exams are breathing down our necks, but fear not! Our meetings maybe once a week, but let's make every second count. 🕰️

*To keep the momentum rolling, I want you to set a target to submit at least one application for a $300 plan by Monday!* 🚀💸
Let's do this!
15/12/23, 3:36 pm - +91 6239 752 194: Alright Ms.Jasmine i will do my best
