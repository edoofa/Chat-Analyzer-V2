Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 4435010: So according to what I have seen in the group discussion...I think this is a scholarship program that is helping learners persue in different courses provided by the university especially African countries
12/12/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 4435010: And the other thing is that we need good results which are credit or better
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: It also deals with private institutions that offer scholarships in india
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir/madam
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 4435010: Thank you for the information and the programs u are offering is exactly what I want
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: It is Sir.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Simposo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 4435010: Oh sorry
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes I do sir

12/12/23, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7932921: Good afternoon sir, this is Mr Mwaangwa the father to Simposo. Kindly accept my apologies for coming in late. This is due to family engengements which pressed us urgently. However, My and I are now available to answer and support our daughter for any further assignments relating to the subject matter
12/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Good afternoon, Mr. Mwaangwa! No need to apologize; family engagements take priority. It's wonderful to have you here to support Simposo.

According to my expertise, the following courses will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

For Muchindu : *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
For Simposo : *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
15/12/23, 10:15 am - +260 97 4435010: So what's your say about this.....we change our courses or...
15/12/23, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: Simposo, you wanted to do management accounting and international finance, right?
15/12/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: So that is why I have offered you the course of B.com.
15/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 4435010: Y can't someone start with a degree without a bachelor
15/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 4435010: Ohhh alright
15/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Commerce is an University degree only, Simposo.
15/12/23, 11:04 am - +260 97 4435010: Ohh I understand
15/12/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: And for Muchindi, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
15/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

15/12/23, 12:55 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7825680: The reason of studying abroad is to diversify my knowledge and broaden my understanding of how things must me done.
Being abroad will also help me see life at a different angle
Further more I think the course I want to study can be best done in India
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: This question is for both of you @260977825680 @260974435010
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 7825680: It will help me introduce new things that I will see beneficial to the nation. For instance there are some things that are done in India but not done in Zambia which are beneficial and if I learn Abt them I will like to introduce them in my country for it to have maximum quality education
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please ask your sister to answer the same.
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 7825680: Alright sir
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 4435010: The reason I want to study out the country is I think you people have better teaching facilities which are improved than our country.And I can be offered a lot of job opportunities depending if only I choose a better course and have good results at the end of it all
15/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: And the other reason is that our country is a bit backwards in technologies
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you two are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: Well I can help in the development of the the education system in our country by becoming a lecturer whose advocate is to introduce new learning skills or if the plan fails ...I can encourage people to work hard so that they apply for the sponsorship and use the technics in our country.... for a better tomorrow..... If I would get another opportunity I would like to organize people who are doing the same course as mine and act as the pressure group towards our country so that the learning skills can be changed by showing them what we archived using new learning skills....
15/12/23, 3:22 pm - +260 97 7825680: What I would like to contribute in the education system of my country is the quality of education offered.
I sadly noticed that a lot of pupils graduate from school without them acquiring any skills at all. What has caused this is lack of practical subjects in the curriculum. In Zambia it's mostly on theory and less of practical so I would rather change that first for the majority of graduates to acquire skills to enable them to survive
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Simposo and Muchindu, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 4435010: Absolutely true
15/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 7825680: Yes I do agree
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
