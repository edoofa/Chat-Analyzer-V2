14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: So let me brief you about the program myself.
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you
14/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 401 8032: I totally understand this is great.
14/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 401 8032: This is amazing.
14/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 401 8032: I am learning I am learning.
14/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 401 8032: That is exactly what I am looking forward to do.
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 401 8032: Mr Shorwi Kawadza of Hartzel is my former headmaster .
14/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
14/12/23, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Wynne, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
14/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I have what it takes .
14/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 401 8032: I can meet these conditions . I promise that one
14/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Sorry for late replies network here is a problem
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now Wynne, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

15/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 401 8032: Okay so  5 years after completion of the Aerospace engineering course , I see myself as a satellite engineer working in the satellite operating and launching company , National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) . There , I will be operating satellites providing news to the world , it might be news of weather forecast, criminal cases, health news as I mentioned before. I might want to continue in the academic field taking the MBA so as to enrich my knowledge. This will help me to help and save the world to the best extend I can . I would also like to broadcast news about the Edoofa programme of scholarships since I will be in the department of satellites which also can spread news to the world .

My personal social life , I see myself very happy since I will be persuing the dream of my life .This will help me enlarge my territory in terms of my family , friends ( circle of influence) I will help them in any I will be able to . So this will be the brief me in 5 years after completion of the course. <This message was edited>
