I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Mr. Sagar

29/09/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 259 2616: Evening Mr Sagar, firstly I would like to thank you for giving me this golden opportunity to explain briefly what motivates mi to .......
Umm the thing is that since I started schooling from grade 1till 7 my dreamt job was to special in computer field only .As time goes on I started to do further research abt computer and that even drive mi to do computer science as my practical subject from form1 to 4 and I even chose it as one of my three subjects A level.Cyber security simply refers to measures and polices to ensure safety of data.The most important thing wch drives mi to pursue this career field is that nowadays due to technology people  are now misusing the use u of computing devices i.e hacking, unauthorized duplication etc .This may lead to lose of information and in banks innocent people may be casted out from jobs due to people who are involved in salami slicing and phishing.Therefore due to many problems I discovered  this motivates mi to pursue this career field so that I can be able to develop the legal frame work that address use of Cyber security and also to consolidate the criminal law on computer crime and develop more research in the field of ICT thank you

15/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 259 2616: Afternoon everyone firstly I would like to you for giving me this golden opportunity to explain briefly what motivates me to . The thing is that since I started schooling from grade 1 til 7 my dream job was to specilize in computer field only As time goes on I started to do further research about computer science and that drive mi to do computer science as my practical subject from form 1 to 4 and I even chose it as one of my three subjects in A level .Cyber security simply refers to the measure and polices to ensure safety of data.The most important thing which drives me to pursue this career field is that nowadays due to technology people are now misusing yhe use of computing devices i.e for hacking , unauthorized duplication etc.this may lead to lose of important information and in bnks innocent people may be casted out from jobs due to people who are involved in salami slicing and phishing.Therefore due to many problems I discovered this motivates mi to pursue this career field so that I can be able to develop legal frame work that address use of cyber security and also to consolidate the security and law on computer crime and develop more research in the field of ICT
15/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Vallary, Your passion for computer science and your drive to specialize in cybersecurity is compelling. Your journey from nurturing an interest in computing since grade school to choosing it as a practical subject through to A levels reflects a genuine commitment to this field.
15/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
15/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 259 2616: No I'm first one
15/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
