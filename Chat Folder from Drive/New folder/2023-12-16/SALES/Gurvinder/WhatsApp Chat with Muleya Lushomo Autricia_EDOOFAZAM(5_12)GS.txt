Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 11:44 am - +260 97 7482282: It's a scholarship given to school leavers especially from African countries especially those with low income background to help them study in Indian universities and colleges. I also understand that that the program is mostly designed to give priority to girls in science related studies,computer studies,law and business to mention but just a few
05/12/23, 11:49 am - +260 97 7482282: I further understand that grade 12 school leaving examinations results will be used for selection criteria.
05/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
05/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 5:12 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

13/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Hi Autricia, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
13/12/23, 1:47 pm - +260 97 7482282: Good afternoon counselor? Apologies for my communication inconsistence. Am located in a rural set up with a lot of network challenges especially during the rain season in which we are now.
I also share phone with my father.Am alright,just hoping for the best outcome
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your issue, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
13/12/23, 7:52 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

3). Am a teacher

5).I sponsored her fees from grade 8 to 10.After that my mother fell victim to diabetes and had leg amputation in 2021 a situation that saw birth to  family financial challenges.We almost withdrew her from boarding to day school but well wishers came on board to see her complete school in boarding owing to her outstanding performance in grade 7 and 9 exams.
6). Myself. Am the only bread winner of the family 
7). She has five siblings. All of them are still in school 8).She has been at njase girls secondary, southern province of Zambia.Her fees were K2,150.00___though we have not yet received confirmation whether the well wishers who pledged to pay her fees for grade 11 and 12 have did so! 
The girl has been really focused, ambitious and self motivated. She's really a good model to her siblings. Once helped , she can help her five siblings and other family members. I submit 🙏
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Thank you for sharing comprehensive details about Lushomo. Her dedication and resilience are truly admirable. Despite the challenges, her focus on education and career aspirations speaks volumes about her determination.

Your commitment to supporting her education is commendable. It's evident that Lushomo's drive to excel and serve as a role model for her siblings stems from the support and guidance she receives from you.

Rest assured, we're here to assist and guide Lushomo through this application process. Her ambition to study Law or pursue a medical career reflects a bright future ahead. We'll work diligently to explore opportunities for her higher education abroad, ensuring she receives the necessary support and guidance.
14/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - +260 97 7482282: No one! The closest is registered nursing the young sister to her grandmother did. So far she's the highest earner and most educated from her mother's side.

15/12/23, 8:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 8:43 am - +260 97 7482282: Thanks so much! We have strong faith and hope in the program and process. We remain focused and ambitious, regardless of circumstances , thanks and good day _Lushomo
15/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Also Mr Muleya, I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficult situation your family faced due to your mother's health challenges. It's indeed a trying time when health issues bring forth financial burdens.

It's heartening to know that despite the challenges, there were well-wishers who stepped in to support Lushomo's education, recognizing her exceptional academic performance. Their kindness and support made a significant difference in enabling her to continue her education in boarding school.

Given Lushomo's aspirations for higher education abroad, may the well-wishers who generously supported her schooling consider extending their support for her further studies? Their contribution could profoundly impact her academic journey and help fulfill her aspirations.
15/12/23, 1:57 pm - +260 97 7482282: Sincerely speaking,the school accounts still indicates that the well wishers have not deposited any single fee for the girl . That means I will have to pay the balance in order to collect her results. You may verify that with her former school authorities
15/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: It is disheartening to hear that, Mr Muleya.
