As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
14/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 327 3950: It’s o okay ✅ 
Firstly i want to address my parents and after that I will add them
14/12/23, 3:47 pm - Kunal: Alright Blessing
May I know by when you will be discussing with your parents?
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board meeting. Let us connect at 5:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.
