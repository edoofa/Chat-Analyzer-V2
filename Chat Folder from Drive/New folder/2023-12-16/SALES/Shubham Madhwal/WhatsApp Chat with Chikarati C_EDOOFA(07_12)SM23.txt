Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I am a Christian , in denomination seventh day Adventist.I was born in a family of three and I'm the first born. My siblings are currently doing their primary school at a local school called Saint Paul's Gokwe primary school. My father is a rehabilitation Technician at Gokwe District Hospital where we stay .He obtained a diploma as highest form if education. My mother has just finished her Nursing training and is awaiting results. My parents have been paying for my school fees from primary to Ordinary level and now advanced level but to study abroad there can be slight problems since their earnings cannot support all our fees. To study abroad I seek  financial aid so as to pursue my courses abroad . I would like to study abroad because I seek higher quality education for my course doing medicine . I personally think myself as an A student Wich is evidenced by 9 straight A in ordinary level at Lower Gwelo Adventist high school including A's in science subjects Maths and chemistry and 4 B's. I also have a higher education examination council Distinction in computer operations and packages and credit in information, communication and Technology. I am awaiting my A level results wich I wish to score a maximum of 20 points in Pure mathematics, Physics, chemistry and statistics and a minimum of 16 points.And abroad I would like to take a course in medicinal sciences in order to pursue my dream carrier of being a medical doctor with your aid I may advance even further and further in improving and saving lives . In short that's all I can say about myself and I thank you for even trying me to indulge in this Edoofa program . My wish is to be part of the study abroad scholarship program with a 100% scholarship if I deserve and if it is the will of God .
09/12/23, 1:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
09/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 291 7701: As I already highlighted I was studying at Lower Gwelo Adventist High school. It is an seventh day Adventist church institution , a mission church sited in Gweru Midlands province

The school is an internationally accredited school with an A as of this year ..it provides high quality education. It also enhanced my physical growth as we used to work in fields with regular work programs , this helped me to learn to farm, woodwork , clean and much more . We also had a gym at school where we kept our physical bodies healthy

It also touched the spiritual aspect because we had morning prayers everyday and regular meetings in church to learn about God and how to mold our characters to be good students qualified for heaven. I participated in church programs and was appointed a pathfinder counselor.

Mentally I participated in quiz activities ...Aids quiz we reached district level as a team and this aided in sharpening my mind ...I also participated in bible quiz at church.. we also went for school quiz and I represented my school as best in chemistry till district level .. I am also a chess Wizard with an unbeaten streak record at this school 

I was part of three clubs at the schools namely Young farmer's club Wich we learnt of new ways of crop cultivation and animal husbandry and First aid club Wich taught me much about caring for others and procedures when someone is injured 
And finally with computer club we spread computer literacy in surrounding schools

And most importantly I was the school senior prefect Wich taught me how to enforce the rules and I made very good lasting relationship with many teachers at this school


I am very proud to say I had the best high school experience at this schools and enhanced my growth , physically, mentally, morally and spiritually
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
09/12/23, 2:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Medical science, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
09/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Well since childhood I grew up at a health institution from one General hospital to the other .... So I grew up idolizing doctors and health personals wanting to be like them when I grow up ...and now I'm grown I've realized that my dream has become my passion.... I love helping others and I feel like it's my calling... At school I was the captain of the First aid club ... At school I love chemistry thats my favorite subject thus people encouraged me to do medical sciences
Whenever someone fell sick at school they came to me for medication and I ended up with a nickname Dr chiks ... surrounding influences always say you will be a great doctor ...and since I personally love that job the words are  motivation to me 

I want to help in someone's recovery ...I do my best to make sure someone is well ...maybe it all started when I was young when I faced the trauma when my cousin brother had a seizure and I cried feeling helpless and couldn't do anything..he was later saved by a doctor..thus I devoted my work to saving lives 

The subject I do at A level if I pass will lead me to my future path of being a doctor.

14/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Well I loved both physics and biology almost equally the same and at O level I had a B in both subject but due to the circumstances at our school you had to choose one between physics and biology...so I opted for physics since it has a wide range of job applications and my strength is in calculations..
14/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 291 7701: I also heard that with physics you can still venture into the field of medicine...
14/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 291 7701: After my O level results it was a hard choice between physics and biology but I made the tough choice ...taking physics
14/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Chikarati, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
14/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 291 7701: No,  not yet
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
14/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 291 7701: Thank you for shedding light ....so seems like I don't qualify for medicine in India
14/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
