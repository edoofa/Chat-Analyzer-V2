26/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 130 5140: Okay l understand
26/10/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
26/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 130 5140: Nop.... we are not familiar with that
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: In simple words Nondumiso, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 130 5140: Okay... may you kindly tell me more about this earn while you learn program
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: Sure
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/10/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 130 5140: This is exactly what l was looking for
26/10/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear that
26/10/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes
26/10/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: Nondumiso, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/10/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
26/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 130 5140: The student end up spending $1500 -$2250
26/10/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: Exactly Nondumiso, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/10/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
26/10/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/10/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
27/10/23, 6:32 am - +263 71 130 5140: Please explain the payment process
27/10/23, 6:33 am - +263 71 130 5140: So the fee is now $350
27/10/23, 7:38 am - Tushti: Good morning, Nondumiso
27/10/23, 7:39 am - Tushti: Shall I proceed further now?
27/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 229 5893: Good morning.. Sorry not now Nondumiso is at school and lam at work.
27/10/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: The session is almost complete, may I ask you to stay online for 10 minutes so that we may conclude it?
27/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 229 5893: Okay you mean me the mother?
27/10/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 130 5140: Yes proceed
27/10/23, 9:56 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/10/23, 9:57 am - Tushti: Nondumiso,basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/10/23, 9:57 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/10/23, 9:58 am - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
27/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 229 5893: Thank you for the counselling section you have made with my daughter..l followed all your converasation and am grateful you clarified a lot of issues coz as parents we were worried as to how she will meet her day to day necessities,but thank your Earn while you Learn program 👏🏻
27/10/23, 10:15 am - Tushti: Thank you, for being such a an enthusiastic parent @263772295893
27/10/23, 10:15 am - Tushti: Shall I now explain further?
27/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 130 5140: Yes explain.
27/10/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
27/10/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Alright @263711305140 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/10/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
27/10/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 229 5893: Sorry may l impose a question..Are you aware that Nondumiso is in her Lower six and she still has 2024 for her final year at high school??
27/10/23, 10:19 am - Tushti: Yes, we are aware that she has applied for the 2025 intake!
27/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 229 5893: Thank you for making me aware of the August 2025 lntake
27/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 130 5140: So since l applied for the 2025 intake.  Should l pay $350 this year
27/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 229 5893: So let's suppose she qualifies and pay the fee of$350 then she doesn't get enough points to qualify her for University level.. what will then happen
27/10/23, 10:36 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
27/10/23, 10:36 am - Tushti: Now, I am pretty certain that she would fulfil the criteria, aren't you?
27/10/23, 10:36 am - Tushti: Yes, dear, the enrollment must be done now so that you can join Edoofa and start earning with your EWYL Program
27/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 229 5893: Yes Yes l can assure you that Nondumiso is hard working learner who always aim high and then put her level best to reach achieve her goal.. Further more as parents we always make sure that she gets all the support socially.. academically and also spiritually..
27/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 229 5893: You mentioned that you are aware of the financial constraints we are facing down this side and l had you mention that you will assist us as parents also to meet the financial expenses of our daughter.. how best are you going to do that??
27/10/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: That was explained here, please
27/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 229 5893: Iam sorry l end here for today need to attend to work issues.. once again thank you for your dedication and commitment you are contributing towards our journey to Edoofa 👏🏻
27/10/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: Noted
27/10/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: Please ask the student to continue the session with me
27/10/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/10/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/10/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/10/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
27/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 229 5893: Iam sure she is listening..we are not together she is at school.. not sure if she is having a free lesson since she is at school.. you will hear from her.. Nondumiso please carry on..
27/10/23, 10:54 am - Tushti: Noted
27/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 229 5893: Noted with thanks
27/10/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/10/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on Monday  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*

30/10/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finances in Short
You can simply understand the financial part of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc. A part of this fee would be due 7 days from getting the Letter of Acceptance.

2. Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there

In this essay l am going to examine the life in Rwanda after sixteen years. Firstly l will define the word genocide and then discuss the economic, health facilities, education and infrastructure respectively . According to the Oxford Dictionary genocide is the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethical group with the aim of destroying that nation or group . Genocide in Rwanda was the period when massive extra judicial killings took place. 

The period of conflict and genocide was very disruptive and distructive . Rwanda was a very poor in the years just before genocide. Most farmers lacked sufficient land to provide themselves and their families. The economic conditions worsened because drought and limits of governmental spending impose by international financial institutions. Leading sectors include energy agriculture, trade and hospitality and financial serves Rwanda economy is overwhelmingly rural and heavily dependent on agriculture. Strong growth in the services sector particularly in Construction and tourism has contributed to overall economic growth. In 2007 Rwanda joined the East African Community. It is also a member of the common market for Easter and Southern African . Rwanda signed the agreement on the movement of goods and services within the Africa Continental Free Trade Area . 

Health wise Rwanda’s health care system was extremely weak even comparison to neighboring countries. Many women suffered the consequence of rape and sexual violence. Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. A lot of diseases such as HIV/AIDS , Malaria and Tuberculosis were faced by Rwanda . There was also dearth of health care professionals, inadequate infrastructure and decline in resources. Rwanda is now one of the Africa’s leaders in the industry boasting a robust universal healthcare system. Rwanda’s healthcare has maintained it’s strength in the face of recent health crises that have to rovaged other world health networks.

Education is a governmental Priority. The Rwanda government realizes that raising the level of education attainment  is crucial for economic prosperity of this tiny country that lacks natural resources . Notably Rwanda has one of the highest elementary school enrollment rate on the continent. Rwanda’s Development strategy prioritizes science and technology education and ICT skills and also emphasizes vocational and technical training in the field of technology. Shortage of qualified university instructors and lack of well developed research , universities are other obstacles to progress. The Rwanda government also promotes student’s mobility with national scholarship programs which in views as an investment in human capital development. The switch to English as the language of instruction has made it easier for the Rwandan students to study in English speaking countries such as USA . Rwanda has made in reconstructions and improving it’s  educational system. The country achieved almost full participation in elementary education. However significant problems remain . Access to early childhood is limited and classroom are overcrowded. Rwanda universities usually use semester systems that comprises two semesters of fifteen weeks each . 

During genocide the roads and buildings of Rwanda were destroyed . But 16 years after the genocide the Rwanda’s annual budget is committed to the transport and other infrastructure. To develop a vibrant private sectors, Rwanda is investing in roads , water transport and infrastructure within the intent of dramatically reducing the cost of transport to individuals

My inspiration story 

As a young girl l believe everyone has the right to a life opportunity and justice, no matter where they live and that ordinary people can change the world. I would like to share my inspiration story of a group of women who noted that because women have traditionally been marginalized in the science field and as result missed the opportunity of employment and reaching high level of education .

The story of women Rose Mlambo and Aretha Mare , the founder members of Tech women Zimbabwe, decided to come together in helping bridge the gender gap and foster innovation in Zimbabwe. It is noted that these women began using workshops, project funding, scholarships and awards to empower women and girls to venture into STEM related fields and business. STEM means Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. 

Furthermore these women have witnessed the transformation of girls and women who have seen how technology can be a critical key to empowerment in Zimbabwe . Techwomen has helped a number  of young girls and women realist their potential in STEM as well as nurtured their ideas into highly competent science initiatives. Through  this program ,Techwomen have empowered almost two hundred people on how to use technology to create solutions to everyday problems and to make money out of entrepreneurship 

The story of these dedicated women from Techwomen Zimbabwe have become an inspiration to me and are motivating me to keep focused on attaining a high level of success in my sciences so that upon completing my higher level at the university l also plough back to my community. I believe the founder members of Techwomen Zimbabwe firstly got empowered academically which enabled them to help empower the lives of other women and young girls .

Furthermore l am inspired about the group of fourteen year old girls who were driven by the vision of  Techwomen to press on to achieving their dreams
04/11/23, 12:38 am - +263 71 130 5140: These fourteen year old young girls have also inspired me greatly in that though it is believed that in Zimbabwe only 19% of the female students graduate from STEM compared to 39% of male students is stated by the World Economic Forum, there are still some potential girls who will reach high standards of success in life 

The story of t he we women inspires me that if only l will attain a scholarship with Edoofa , l will one day spread my wings and fly up above  and upon landing l could also plough back into my community no matter where l will be , be it abroad or within my borders
04/11/23, 12:39 am - +263 71 130 5140: I believe all girls count and that all girls deserve the chance to change the world. This has been witnessed by  the success story of the Techwomen who have driven me to live a life with a meaning so as to fulfill my hopes and my desires to make my life as a live of other young virals brighter.

09/11/23, 10:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
09/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 229 5893: We have received and read the contents on the    Acceptance letter .May we please know how are we supposed to make payment??
09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please did you go through page-4 of t he letter?
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we  connected?
09/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Sorry we read that section in passing.... It's now noted with clarity
09/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Can we use FBC branch in Bulawayo since we are based in Bulawayo
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please you can,  So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Nondumiso's acceptance letter?
09/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 229 5893: 14 November 2023  for the first part which is $200 

Then 14  December 2023 for the last part which is $150
09/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
09/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Upton realising that paying through the Associate's account attract a fee of 12.5percent,we think it is best to make a Direct Bank Transfer... Please may you excuse us for today.. then will discuss more on this tomorrow as we make all the final arrangements on payment..Something is obstructing my attention at the moment.. Thank you..
09/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Upon*
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
09/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 12:00 pm CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
09/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Mrs Nyathi @263772295893, How are you?
10/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 937 6844: Good morning. We wish to advise that we are taking the option of paying through Mr Kawadza Shorwi's account. 

May you corfirm if our calculation is correct.

Payment Amount $200
12.5% of 200 =       $25
Total transfer =     $225

Total amount to be transferred to Mr Kawadza Shorwi's account is USD 225.

Awaiting your approval. 

Thank you.
Good Day.
10/11/23, 10:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Mrs Nyathi
Yes please you are correct!
10/11/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?

10/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 937 6844: This message was deleted
10/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 937 6844: May you revisit  the payment deadline for Nondumiso. I think you intended to say 22 Nov 2023, not September. We wish you may confirm.
10/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263772295893, Nondumiso's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 14th of November 2023, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
10/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Iam home now may we please proceed with the session
10/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263772295893, Nondumiso's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 14th of November 2023, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
10/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Noted sir.We wish to do the formalities on Monday the 13th of November 2023.
10/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263772295893 you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
10/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
10/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 229 5893: It's true sir..The challenge as of now is that I just knocked off now from work and Nondumiso's father is away on work related issues but will be back today or tomorrow he is the one to do the procedures.On Monday we are show to make the bank transfer first thing in the morning..
10/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
10/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Let's suppose l make the transfer on Monday, will it reach your attention that very same day there is no challenge on Network's?
10/11/23, 3:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please you can  share with us the transaction slip for the same so that we can get it confirmed the same day!
10/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 229 5893: That's great then
10/11/23, 3:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are  there any questions y ou  would like toa ssk?
10/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 229 5893: On the Earn While you learn program what sorts of projects will she be doing

10/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 229 5893: Noted..seems to be an empowerment program..As parents we welcome this problem and are geared to assist our daughter and at the same time we will be learning new skills.. Thank you sir for the eye opener..
10/11/23, 4:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Your most welcome please, I would now like to share with you this video for better clarification on the same!
