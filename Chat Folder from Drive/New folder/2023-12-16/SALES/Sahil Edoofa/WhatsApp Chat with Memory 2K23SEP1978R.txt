Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I was impressed with the EYL program. It introduces learners to work environment at a tender age and equips them with the experience they require before full time employment.

06/10/23, 3:54 pm - +91 72920 63289: I'm delighted to hear that you were impressed with the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. It's indeed an excellent initiative that offers numerous benefits to students.

Additionally, the ability to self-fund their education through this program can significantly reduce the financial burden on both students and their families, making quality education more accessible.

09/10/23, 4:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes they are clear
09/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Very clear
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
09/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes we are following
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes they are clear
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes we may
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - +91 72920 63289: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - +91 72920 63289: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Go ahead and share
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 220 4972: The network is very poor was trying to watch the first one but it's taking time 
I think it will be quite effective that we schedule for tomorrow morning since the network is more effective during the night
09/10/23, 5:26 pm - +91 72920 63289: I completely understand the network issues you're facing, and I appreciate your patience. Scheduling for tomorrow morning when the network tends to be more effective sounds like a reasonable plan. Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 02:30 pm?
09/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Yes
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:30 pm.
10/10/23, 3:21 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Memory.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good afternoon. Sorry for late response. I was busy with other duties. I am not sure why Memory is not responding. Maybe  it's network issues
10/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I personally was busy and had not had the time to go through the vedios
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for your message. It's understandable that sometimes network issues or other commitments can make it challenging to respond promptly. As for Memory, it's possible that network problems are preventing her from responding. It's essential to consider such technical difficulties.
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: Regarding the videos, may I know by when will you be able to go through them since Memory is unable to connect with us now?
10/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I am sorry for the hiccups. I am committed elsewhere for now. I can only listen to them after 7 pm tonight. I am sorry I thought Memory would do this.
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is alright, please. I understand in that case, Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 08:00 pm?
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 339 0549: It depends on network speed.  But I will try my best to be able to do that
10/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright, let us reconnect today at 08:00 pm.

10/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 339 0549: There was no electricity and network as well
10/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I did not manage to listen to the videos. Seems Memory can't connect as well due to erratic network connection
10/10/23, 8:51 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for letting me know about the electricity and network issues. It can be challenging to stay connected in such situations. In that case, will you be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 02:30 pm?
10/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 339 0549: So I suggest we reschedule to meet tomorrow 230pm cat

11/10/23, 2:34 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Memory.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, I would like to inquire, were you able to go through the videos by now?
11/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good afternoon. Yes I did

11/10/23, 2:38 pm - +91 72920 63289: Surely, I shall wait for your response.
11/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 339 0549: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 339 0549: SOP - Statement of Purpose
11/10/23, 2:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
11/10/23, 2:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/10/23, 2:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/10/23, 2:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 339 0549: So yes that is the message I got from the videos
11/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok thank you for the summary
11/10/23, 2:53 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I am following
11/10/23, 2:54 pm - +91 72920 63289: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of Memory's university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in her admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/10/23, 2:54 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
11/10/23, 2:55 pm - +91 72920 63289: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

11/10/23, 2:59 pm - +91 72920 63289: For this step, we would require memory's involvement for just 1 hour. So can I anticipate she will be able to fill out the SOP and complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 pm?
11/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 339 0549: So you may meet her maybe at 8 pm. Another setback is that she hasn't collected her Advanced level certificate. Is there no other way this could be done
11/10/23, 3:06 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, what she can do is complete the tasks and fill the SOP today at 08:00 pm and you can share her response tomorrow and for the documents, she can share them at night. For the A- level, could you share the screenshot from the online portal?
11/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 339 0549: The portal is now closed but I want to believe the first application she did with you had the online results portal. If possible maybe you may assist and use that one

11/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Sorry so the documents you shared are the same documents on google forms?

12/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good afternoon. I am fine and you.
12/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I have just called Memory and she informed me that she has submitted the documents but there is no network. It's really a problem
12/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 339 0549: So I believe once she gets access to the network we will see her documents
12/10/23, 12:26 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and thank you for sharing the update, I understand that the network can be a big challenge, but that is alright, please. I shall wait for her response.

12/10/23, 4:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - +91 72920 63289: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Agreed
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 339 0549: True this was discussed but I missed the point that it is required within two weeks of admission
12/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 339 0549: It's ok let's move onp
12/10/23, 7:51 pm - +91 72920 63289: That's excellent information to have. Please do not worry we will help you understand again. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 4:08 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes understood
13/10/23, 1:29 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good day, Parents and Memory.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
13/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 220 4972: We are all available let's move on
13/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya and she has scheduled my session for _(13 October 2023)*
13/10/23, 1:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with Memory's EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing the session date with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
13/10/23, 1:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Thank you, will do that
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes very clear.
13/10/23, 1:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - +91 72920 63289: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Understood
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - +91 72920 63289: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok noted
13/10/23, 2:06 pm - +91 72920 63289: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I think I am clear. Basically after being admitted by the university I pay the registration fees, get an admission acceptance letter, visa acquisition and flying to India. But there is also need to pay half the annual fee within 3 days of arriving in India
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to know that you are clear. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Really interesting. I hope all will move well for our Memory as well. I am worried though with the time frame required to pay the registration fee. I personally thought we will be given more time to do that
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: I hope it works out well for Memory too. I understand your concern about the time frame for paying the registration fee. However, as me move ahead your concern about the time frame will be at ease.
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
13/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/10/23, 3:59 pm - +91 72920 63289: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
13/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes let's move on
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 72920 63289: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 72920 63289: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 72920 63289: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Memory, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok ok interesting. Please go ahead.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 9:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 4:04 am - +263 77 339 0549: It's a good advantage
14/10/23, 8:29 am - +91 72920 63289: Good morning Parents and Memory.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, hence we were unable to get back to you, however, I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
14/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning. Yes I am available.
14/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 339 0549: Let's go ahead with the discussion
14/10/23, 8:36 am - +91 72920 63289: This message was deleted
14/10/23, 8:36 am - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that.  So may I know if you are clear so far?
14/10/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 339 0549: So far so good. I am home and dry.
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +91 72920 63289: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +91 72920 63289: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 339 0549: Oh ok. It's good news really
14/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 339 0549: Quite interesting. We may move on
14/10/23, 8:47 am - +91 72920 63289: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 8:47 am - +91 72920 63289: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 8:48 am - +91 72920 63289: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am very clear. What happens let's say one fails to clear the registration fee in the stipulated time due to circumstances beyond one's control
14/10/23, 9:08 am - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing your query, in such a case, the university shall revoke the offer letter, however, if discussed with us and well informed we do discuss the same with the Academic Board and if they consider the reason genuine then they assist us to provide you with a payment plan please, so please do not worry, however, this please understand that it is a very rare consideration.
14/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 339 0549: Understood thank you
14/10/23, 9:13 am - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am clear. I hope for the best
14/10/23, 9:15 am - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to know that. As Memory's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Memory is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am excited and hopeful that she will be part of the group for this month
14/10/23, 9:18 am - +91 72920 63289: I am really happy to hear that, looking forward to connecting with her. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 339 0549: I look forward to the offer letter. Thank you so much. Have a blessed day too and I hope the Almighty will guide this process
17/10/23, 11:16 pm - +91 81787 23499: Good Evening Parents and Memory,

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

18/10/23, 10:21 pm - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for providing the details @263773390549. As per Memory's offer letter, MVN University has awarded her a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout her course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in her letter, she has also been awarded a 100% waiver on her accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to her will be free of cost throughout her stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making her education more affordable, isn’t it?
18/10/23, 11:18 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes it is
19/10/23, 8:39 am - +91 81787 23499: I am glad to see we are together @263773390549. Moving forward, as you can see in Memory's offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, her remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 8:39 am - +91 81787 23499: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600. I hope we share the same calculation and are together in our discussion so far?
19/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am a bit lost on the tuition fee. I thought it was fully sponsored. Please enlighten me on that
19/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 339 0549: So I thought the tuition fee is $0 instead of $350
19/10/23, 3:22 pm - +91 81787 23499: Talking about the registration fee, let's turn our focus to the registration fee outlined in Shantelle's offer letter. As mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in her offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after she arrives in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of her arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I thought basing on our previous discussions that the registration fee formed part of the tuition fee and I was assuming since this was fully sponsored it fell away.
19/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 339 0549: $1000 is a lot of money to raise in 15 days even in two months in an economy like Zimbabwe. Are there no other ways of spreading payment of this money given that the student is starting her education in August 2024.
19/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Just thinking. Because I had been assured that the registration fee would not be above $750.
19/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for bringing this query to my attention, @263773390549. Allow me to address it and provide you with the clarity you seek.
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 81787 23499: The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost, as we discussed in my previous message. For Memory, this cost for her first year of education is $1,500 and thus it will be adjusted toawrds the same.
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 81787 23499: Also, regarding the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned, it's true that you were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
19/10/23, 4:12 pm - +91 81787 23499: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason your per annum cost of education is only $1,250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - +91 81787 23499: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Memory's first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose.
19/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I totally understand and agree but my appeal was on payment of the $1000. Is there a possibility of this money being spread over a period of time like maybe 3 to 4 months.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 81787 23499: With that said, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Memory is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that she will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess Memory's scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 81787 23499: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 81787 23499: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer Memory has received. Do you not agree with this @263773390549?
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I agree 100%. This is a lifetime opportunity but was just asking in case such allowances exist
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - +91 81787 23499: Let us come to that as well @263773390549. As you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*.
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - +91 81787 23499: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Memory through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I recall. You may explain sure.
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - +91 81787 23499: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Memory's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - +91 81787 23499: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Memory's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Yes we are in agreement.   Will try our best using the first option
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - +91 81787 23499: That sounds like a good plan @263773390549 and I am certain with the efforts you have in place, you will be able to secure Memory's scholarship seat with MVN University in due time. Also, now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - +91 81787 23499: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 4:06 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes I am in Harare
20/10/23, 7:43 am - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 7:43 am - +91 81787 23499: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 7:43 am - +91 81787 23499: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 8:03 am - +263 77 339 0549: Noted very helpful thank you
20/10/23, 8:08 am - +91 81787 23499: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/10/23, 8:08 am - +91 81787 23499: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes for my records please
20/10/23, 8:17 am - +91 81787 23499: Surely @263773390549. If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 339 0549: Thank you. Be blessed abundantly.
20/10/23, 8:23 am - +91 81787 23499: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am running around to look for the money. Honestly this is a golden chance for Memory and I would suffer a heart attack if she fails to make it. I will strive to pay the $425 before the deadline and also scrounge around to pay end of November. If anything goes wrong I will inform you in advance
20/10/23, 8:30 am - +91 81787 23499: I completely understand your situation, @263773390549. We appreciate your dedication to securing this opportunity for Memory. We will do our best to assist you throughout this process, and I am glad to hear that you're taking the necessary steps to make this happen. If you face any challenges or require support along the way, please feel free to reach out to us. We're here to help, and your commitment to Memory's future is truly commendable. 

Since you do not have any queries as of now, shall we move forward and shall I share the university insights with you?
20/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 339 0549: Yes please go ahead.
20/10/23, 8:43 am - +91 81787 23499: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -
20/10/23, 8:43 am - +91 81787 23499: MVN University is one of the prestigious universities located in Delhi NCR, India.

20/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 339 0549: Very interesting, thank you
20/10/23, 9:06 am - +91 81787 23499: You are most welcome @263773390549. Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing Memory's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/10/23, 9:07 am - +91 81787 23499: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as Memory has received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing her one step closer to realizing her dream of pursuing education abroad.
20/10/23, 9:07 am - +91 81787 23499: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for Memory's admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am happy so far with the effort and support you have given me and my family so far. If I meet any challenges I will get in touch. Have a good weekend.
20/10/23, 9:14 am - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for your regards @263773390549. On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed weekend ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
20/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Sorry for bringing this late. What is the status on food in all this? Is food provided by the University or else?
20/10/23, 7:49 pm - +91 81787 23499: @263773390549 addressing this query of yours, food is not included in the services offered and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this we are together?
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok this is noted. So it means the student must have to budget some money for food. Is that so?
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - +91 81787 23499: Good Evening to the Parents and Memory,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - +91 81787 23499: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - +91 81787 23499: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 09:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - +91 81787 23499: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 5:15 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good to hear from you. 9 am is fine with me
27/10/23, 7:50 am - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for your response @263773390549. I am glad to hear that you will be available today at 9 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
27/10/23, 9:18 am - +91 81787 23499: Parents and Memory, we are here to continue our discussion following our yesterday conversations. Could you please confirm your availability so that we can reconnect and move forward with our discussion about the offer letters from the universities? 

We are here to guide you through the remaining formalities of your admission process.
27/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning. I am available
27/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 339 0549: We may continue our discussion. I am here and ready.
27/10/23, 9:40 am - +91 81787 23499: I am pleased to hear that, @263773390549. Before we dive into our conversation today, I would like to ask if there are any specific questions or concerns you would like to discuss. Is the query you brought up the other day about food expenses the only topic on your mind, or are there other matters you woud like to address?
27/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 339 0549: No queries but only to mention that I am struggling to raise the required amount of the registration fee. Those who had pledged to help are no longer forth coming. But I am still looking around. All I can say for now. The situation in Zimbabwe right now is terrible for the ordinary person.
27/10/23, 10:12 am - +91 81787 23499: Thank you for sharing your situation with us, @263773390549. We understand that raising the registration fee can be challenging, and we appreciate your efforts to find a solution. It is unfortunate to hear about the difficulties faced by the ordinary person in Zimbabwe, and we empathize with the situation.

Please rest assured that we are here to assist you in every possible way. We are committed to working closely with you and exploring options to make the payment process as manageable as we can. Our aim is to ensure that your child's educational journey progresses smoothly.
27/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 339 0549: I am glad to hear about this. Your assistance is well appreciated
27/10/23, 10:29 am - +91 81787 23499: Yes, @263773390549, we understand that times can be challenging, and we appreciate your efforts to secure your child's future. To assist you better, could you please provide some more information? Specifically, what amount have you been able to raise so far, and what do you anticipate being able to raise before the due date? This information will help us explore potential solutions and ensure that we align with your circumstances.
27/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 339 0549: I have managed to raise $150 so far and was expecting to get to $200 and someone had promised to provide $225 to make it $425 before 31 October   but then he suddenly changed his mind and informed he could no longer afford.
27/10/23, 11:01 am - +91 81787 23499: I understand, Ma'am, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's crucial to remember that when it comes to pursuing education abroad, determination plays a significant role. The challenges you have encountered are not unique, as many students have faced similar difficulties, particularly given the current economic conditions.
27/10/23, 11:01 am - +91 81787 23499: The Zimbabwean economy has been experiencing various challenges, making it tough for students who aspire to further their education. This is why many students have chosen to study in India.
27/10/23, 11:01 am - +91 81787 23499: The rationale behind this decision is that pursuing education in India offers a brighter future. If they were to study in Zimbabwe under the same economic conditions, it might not provide them with the best opportunities for their personal and professional growth. Thus, it's a strategic move for their future careers. Can you relate to this perspective?
27/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 339 0549: I understand this very clearly. It's a very big advantage to study in India than in Zimbabwe currently
27/10/23, 11:07 am - +91 81787 23499: Right, @263773390549. As you mentioned that before the due date of 31st October, you will be able to raise an amount of $200 which will leave a balance of $650.

To address the challenge you are facing in raising the remaining $650, it's important to understand the plan you have in place and how much time you would need to raise this amount on a monthly basis. If you could provide details about your current financial situation and your ability to allocate funds toward this goal, we can work on a customized payment plan that aligns with your circumstances and helps you meet the deadline.
27/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 339 0549: Currently like I said before I am not formally employed and the amount of money that I can raise a month is around $200 to $300 and this is for a family of four. So for me to give an actual figure here maybe difficult and it will be not good for both of us if the agreement is not honoured. But all I can say is I will be able to put something from $100 and above. I am well educated. I have a Master of  Business Administration but employment is hard to come buy in Zim at the moment but I am busy marketing myself so that I get employment and provide for the family.
27/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Good evening. Just following up on the discussion we had in the afternoon. As a family we take this opportunity for Memory seriously. I would like to commit myself to a payment plan of $150 a month until this figure of $650 is finished
30/10/23, 9:58 pm - +91 95407 16843: Good Evening Parents and Memory!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to let you know that Ms. Vilsha could not connect with you here in due time since she is not feeling well and is taking rest till the time she is completely fit. I appreciate your patience here. 

Moving ahead, as you have mentioned that you are planning to go with the $150 plan and will complete the $650 with that, you can surely do that and we will move ahead to discuss this as well. For now, since the deadline for making the payment of your registration fee is of tomorrow, I believe you would be clearing the first part of $200, right?
31/10/23, 3:19 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning. Thank you very much for your patience and understanding as well. I had managed to raise $200 to the dot. So I will transfer between $150 to $170 tomorrow depending on transfer charges and finish off the balance of the $200 as soon as possible. Please let me know if this is agreeable and will transfer the money to Mr Nherera. Thank you

From our previous discussion, we had agreed a payment plan of $150 until the remaining balance of $739 is finished. I hope this is still the position.

12/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 339 0549: This is well noted thank you
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - +91 96505 37098: You are welcome @263773390549, I am happy to know that you have taken a note of my above messages and the shared fees break is correct.

12/12/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok thank you very much. On my side, my financial position is still weak. I will not have a Christmas holiday at all as I battle to pay the remaining balance but God willing I have hope that all will be well. I am working hard to raise the December installment
12/12/23, 9:35 pm - +91 96505 37098: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
13/12/23, 4:17 am - +263 77 339 0549: Noted thank you
13/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good day. I hope I find you well. I you are free we may continue with the discussion.
13/12/23, 11:57 am - +91 96505 37098: Good Morning Parents and Memory, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response with us, we can start our discussion for today. With this said, As you have mentioned that you are trying your best to complete the next installment by December, I would like to share some important updates with you, May I please share them with you?
13/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 339 0549: Good morning to you as well. Yes please do share the updates
13/12/23, 12:11 pm - +91 96505 37098: Alright @263773390549, I was going through your previous conversation with us and noticed that you were given a flexible payment plan in order to complete your remaining balance with an monthly installment of $150, so that you can complete the registration process conveniently. 

In light of the same, I would like to encourage you to complete the remaining balance of $589 in the installment of $200, as this will help you to secure the endowment benefits that we have shared with you earlier. Please share you thoughts on the same.
13/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 339 0549: I don't quite understand. So the installment of $150 will lead me to lose the endowment benefits?  By the way what are the endowment benefits? Like I said before, I am not actively employed at the moment and raising the $150 is actually a mammoth task. Honestly I would like to quickly complete this payment as soon as possible but I am in a terrible situation.
13/12/23, 12:45 pm - +91 96505 37098: I completely understand your willingness to complete the payment as soon as possible, we wish the same as well. On this note, Let me help you understand the endowment benefits. According to the offer letter shared by the university, the registration fee is $1000 and here comes the Endowment benefit with The $150 grant which has reduced the registration fee from $1000 to $850 only. Additionally with the Endowment benefit, we were able to offer you the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Ok I understand
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +91 96505 37098: Ideally, The Endowment benefits are only valid if you complete the payment of your registration fee by the month of December. Although, Considering that you had some challenge earlier that's why you were given a more flexible payment plan which allows you to pay the registration fees in the monthly installment of $150. On the same note, your remaining amount for the registration is $589 and if you complete the same amount in the installment of $150 you will complete the registration process in the month of March and by this time the university would not allow you to access the Endowment benefits.
13/12/23, 12:48 pm - +91 96505 37098: Hence, I wanted to make sure that you would not miss out on these benefits that's why I suggest you pay this remaining amount of $589 in installments of $200 so that you can complete the registration in February, we will request the university officials to allow you this approach so that you can enjoy the endowment benefits. I hope you understand the same.
13/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 339 0549: All I can say is if I manage to get the $200 I will pay. But the chances are slim. But if you go back to our earlier discussions this payment arrangement had been agreed upon with all those benefits included. I am surprised that it's changing again.
13/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 339 0549: Just out of interest, in case it gets very difficult for me along the way, will I be refunded.
13/12/23, 9:51 pm - +91 96505 37098: @263773390549 I believe there has been a misunderstanding. During our previous discussion, the focus was on assisting you with a payment plan to provide flexibility for the registration fee and ensure the timely securing of Memory's scholarship seat.
13/12/23, 9:51 pm - +91 96505 37098: You mentioned that for the first month, you managed to secure $200, and moving forward, you would attempt to make similar payments, with $150 being the minimum amount you can contribute. Based on this discussion, we engaged with the university officials this month. 

They considered our request for a payment plan, but with the proposed installment schedule, if continued, the completion of formalities would extend until March 2023. Unfortunately, the admissions under the Endowment Benefits are closing this year, and the university can only grant an extension until February.
13/12/23, 9:51 pm - +91 96505 37098: This is the reason for us sharing this update with you. As a parent, all you have to do is to align your preparations so that the remaining balance of $589 can be completed before the end of February. You have three good months available for this balance fee.
13/12/23, 9:52 pm - +91 96505 37098: I am sure you realize that this opportunity has offered Memory a 100% scholarship on her tuition fee and 100% sponsorship on her accommodation with the Endowment Benefits, and your dedication to securing better quality education for your child has been evident throughout the process. 

Our collective efforts have been geared towards ensuring that Memory can access the best possible education. I hope this provides you with a better perspective?
14/12/23, 6:02 am - +263 77 339 0549: It's getting tough for me. That is why I was asking about possibility of a refund. I wanted Memory to get this opportunity but my situation and the demands seems not favourable. What are the effects of missing the endowment grant?
15/12/23, 10:57 pm - +91 96505 37098: Greetings @263773390549, Please excuse me for not connecting with you at the earliest. I would like to connect with you tomorrow and have a discussion regarding your concern. I hope you will be available, have a good night ahead!
