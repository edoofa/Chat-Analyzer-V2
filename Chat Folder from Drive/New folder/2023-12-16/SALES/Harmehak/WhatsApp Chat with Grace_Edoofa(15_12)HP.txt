*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Grace Tammara Kangu. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application.
