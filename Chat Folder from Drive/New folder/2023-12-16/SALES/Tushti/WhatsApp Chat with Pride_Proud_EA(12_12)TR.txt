15/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 779 9874: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 779 9874: My thoughts about India is that it's a good country with a rapid growth economically. From the movies it looks like a peaceful county
15/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 779 9874: **country
15/12/23, 9:56 am - Tushti: Did you go through all the pictures I shared?
15/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 779 9874: Yes I did
15/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: Excellent, now I would like for your parent to come online and join us as I shall be discussing the cost of education
15/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
15/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 779 9874: Yes myself am highly aware of the costs thats why am seeking for a scholarship
15/12/23, 10:00 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/12/23, 10:00 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 10:00 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/12/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 779 9874: Okay I understand this ma'am, so the organization does not offer full funded scholarships
15/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 779 9874: So the remainder is to be settled by the parents
15/12/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: That is right
15/12/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: Now I would like to speak with the parent <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: Kindly ask them to come online
15/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok ma'am
15/12/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: I shall wait
15/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 779 9874: They are still offline but they will get online anytime sooner
15/12/23, 10:22 am - Tushti: Alright, I shall wait for an hour, if they are not online, the application process shall be terminated. I hope I have made myself clear?
15/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok ma'am
15/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Meanwhile, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
15/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/12/23, 10:24 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
15/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 779 9874: It is definitely what I need for my schooling process
15/12/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: I would also like to tell you a little bit about our star students, who happen to be twins as well
15/12/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: Here, take a look at their video
15/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok ma'am
15/12/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 10:29 am - Tushti: Do let me know what your thoughts are
15/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok ma'am
15/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 779 9874: Sounds interesting for me , especially that they are twins like me
15/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 779 9874: Yes I think they are online
15/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 889 4255: I'm also online
15/12/23, 10:37 am - Tushti: @263778894255 Did you understand the cost of education in India? Do yo feel it would be affordable for the family to send the twins to India?
15/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 889 4255: Yes I understood ma'am and it is affordable to send them  to India
15/12/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: Noted
15/12/23, 10:57 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent  would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 779 9874: That's no problem
15/12/23, 10:58 am - Tushti: Pride, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 779 9874: $1500-$2250
15/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 779 9874: This is too much Ms
15/12/23, 11:05 am - Tushti: Exactly Pride, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/12/23, 11:06 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/12/23, 11:06 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 11:06 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 779 9874: So in total the amount needed to be paid is $750 which is annually or what
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: The enrollment fee is $350, dear
15/12/23, 11:08 am - Tushti: It is a one time payment
15/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 779 9874: So is it all that I pay for during the course
15/12/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: No, dear, the tuition fee would have to be paid at the time of admission, the amount would depend upon your scholarship percentage
15/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok but this is going to be challenge to my parents because they don't earn that much especially covering for twins
15/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: Dear, that is where the EWYL Program comes in, I am sure you shall be able to self sponsor your education, isn't it?
15/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 779 9874: Okay so the earn while you learn program is the one that helps me to fund my tuition
15/12/23, 11:15 am - Tushti: Yes!
15/12/23, 11:15 am - Tushti: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 11:15 am - Tushti: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok!
15/12/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: Pride, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/12/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/12/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: I would now like for the parents to join us
15/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok share it with me , maybe I might understand further
15/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 779 9874: Okay so the student has to attain how many points at A level in order to be accepted into the program
15/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
15/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok that is understandable ma'am
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/12/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
15/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 779 9874: Ok
15/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 779 9874: Can I take a break for a few hours, my phone battery is dying.
15/12/23, 11:29 am - Tushti: Sure
15/12/23, 11:29 am - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/12/23, 11:29 am - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 9:30 am * I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
15/12/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your and Proud's smiling face on such a picture very soon!

15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
