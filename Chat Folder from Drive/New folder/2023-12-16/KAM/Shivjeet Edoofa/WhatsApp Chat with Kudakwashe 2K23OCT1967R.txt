Thank you for letting me know that. It is alright; either one of them is correct as they are both your counselors, guiding you through the process. Please let me know if you are clear here.
27/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Yes. Thank you!

27/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 777 2056: oooh thank you! it's supposed to be 17 November 2023 that's when he will be done with his exams.
27/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that Kudakwashe is currently in his exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect his exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, he can enhance his study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit his performance in the upcoming exams. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and his exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
27/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if Kudakwashe is occupied with exams, you on his/her behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
27/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 777 2056: understood
27/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. So, may I know when you might be able to share the form with me?
27/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Tomorrow we will be going to church  . Is it okay on Sunday
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that; however, in order to expedite the process. I would like to let you know that if the form is with you, you can just overwrite the date on the orientation availability date and share a picture of the corrected part with me. May I know if you might be able to do that today?
27/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Its a welcome sir

30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Unfortunately my network connection is quite poor due to power shortages so it might take longer than expected for the completion of the videos
30/10/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that your network connection is affected by power shortages, which can make it challenging to go through the videos quickly. In that case, may I know if you might be able to completely watch the videos by this evening at 8:00 PM?
30/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 229 7277: will try to finish watching the videos before 8:00pm

30/10/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear about the ongoing network issues. It can be quite frustrating when technical problems get in the way of your progress. I hope that by 8:00 PM, your network problems will indeed be resolved, and you can continue watching the videos as planned.
30/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Thank you sir for understanding
30/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 229 7277: My network is really bad but what l've learnt from the few minutes that l was able to watch the first video is that the founders of EDOOFA take pride in seeing their Edoofians  live their dream lives.l have also come to acknowledge the importance of the EWYL program as it instills a feeling of independence as one gets to earn scholarship credits whilst also learning which in turn deducts a percentage of what he/she has to pay for his/her education
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 229 7277: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 229 7277: The problem l am facing
30/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, shall I share with you the audio version of the video?
30/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 229 7277: yes please !

We are happy to proceed!
02/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
02/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
02/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
02/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
02/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
02/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes sir,I was able to understand all of the above. Thank you!
02/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 359 5826: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Question 1
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Question 2:Explain the mechanism of cavitations in pipes and drains?     

Cavitation is the rapid formation and implosion of vapor pockets inside a pumped fluid. The implosions create shock waves that travel through the fluid and damage equipment. The cavitation process can wreak havoc on sensitive and highly engineered lcomponents of piping systems.

Any fluid, especially water has a boiling point proportional to its pressure. The lower the pressure, the lower the point the fluid vaporises. For example it is impossible to get a hot cup of tea at the top of mount Everest as the water boils at a lower temperature due to the reduction in atmospheric pressure.

Any design features in a piping system which cause a sudden increase in fluid velocity can reduce the fluid pressure due to the Bernuli principal where velocity and pressure are proportional. If the fluid pressure drops below the boiling point of of the fluid at the fluid temperature inside the pipe, fluid vapour will be formed. The vapour usually forms bubbles in the flowing fluid. The bubbles themselves are not a big problem but as soon as the fluid pressure stabilises downstream the reverse process occurs. The fluid pressure is now greater than the boiling point of the fluid and the vapour condenses back into fluid. This process is almost instantaneous and the collapsing bubbles create a shock wave as they implode. Each implosion is not a significant shock in itself but multiple small shockwaves can create a resonance in a piping system which can be significant.
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Question 3:What is the meaning of soil reinforcement and why is it important?Please state with example the main causes of a building collapse

Soil reinforcement is a technique which is used to improve the strength and stiffness of soil. Different engineering techniques are used to enhance the strength of soil, like geogrid and geotextile. It is a combination of earth fill and reinforcing strips. They are capable of bearing large tensile strength. Soil reinforcement is a modern technique which is employed in various projects to prevent the failure of slopes of soil and it improves the bearing capacity of the soil.

The benefits of soil reinforcement are as follows
* Compaction behaviour of soil is affected by fibre inclusion with an increase of fibre content dry density is reduced and a marginal increase in optimum moisture content (OMC) is noted.
* The increased numbers of layers and confining pressure lead to an improvement in the performance of reinforced soil.
* Fibre reinforcement increases the tensile strength of soil with an increase in dry density.

Main reasons why building collapse are:
* Lack of maintenance-A lack of maintenance will lead to things like not noticing a problem before it becomes catastrophic 
* Use of inferior materials/chemicals-Such as older (1960s – 1980s) fire retardant treated wood roof assemblies made with cheap ammonium phosphate are prone to collapse after 25 years of service
* Soils-Development of a sinkhole (human-made or natural) can cause a building to collapse
06/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very good, please carry on !
06/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Question 4:Please explain MIVAN construction method and its usage in building projects today?

Mivan technology is a modern construction technique that utilizes aluminum formwork to cast and construct various building elements such as walls, floors, columns, beams, slabs & stairs, etc. Mivan technology or MIVAN Formwork system is a completely modern method that is best suited for the construction of large-scale structures especially when repetitive slabs and blocks are involved. This structural system is very popular for low-cost housing in large cities. It is a slip form work system which was very popular in Middle east, Europe and South East Asia much before it became very popular in India. It came in to India in the early 2000 and is very popular because of the speed of construction and hence the economy it can bring in. The name MIVAN comes from the parent company MIVAN which improvised and innovated the structural form work system. MIVAN revolutionized the speed of construction.

The main difference of MIVAN structural system from a conventional RCC system with respect to structural analysis and design, is the presence of RC walls instead of masonry walls. In a conventional system the stiffness of masonry is often ignored. Even if considered, the masonry stiffness is much different from the RCC walls.
06/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Question 5: What do you mean by pre-fabricated structures and its usage in large infrastructure projects?

Prefabricated buildings, or prefabs, are buildings with components (walls, roof, and floor) that are manufactured in a factory or manufacturing plant. These components can be fully or partially assembled in a factory, then transferred to the site. This method of building construction is preferred due to its cost efficiency, fast turnaround, and reusability. Common applications of prefabricated buildings are temporary construction facilities, office spaces, medical camps, evacuation centers, schools, apartment blocks, and single-detached houses.

Prefabrication is more efficient than conventional on-site construction since manufacturing through a production line is more controlled. Because most buildings have repeating sections of walls, roofs, and floors, a manufacturing process can be developed by putting together a sequence of operations. These operations can be studied and improved, making the manufacturing process more efficient.

Prefabricated buildings provide plenty of benefits for manufacturers, contractors, and end-users. The idea of dividing activities on- and off-site enables greater flexibility on the project schedule and costs, provided that the planners have effective project management capabilities. Off-site fabrication also brings the advantages seen in optimized assembly lines. With regards to market opportunities, prefabricated buildings will ride the trend of eco-friendly or green sustainability. Market share of the industry, both residential and non-residential, is expected to rise in the following years.
06/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the annswers with me. May I know if you were able to fill out the online SOP form as well?
06/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes sir!
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 359 5826: l have not received the message that my response has been recorded though
06/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry now; I have gone through my records, and indeed your details have been submitted. Great job!
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Okay, thank you sir!
It is quite a relief.
06/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you might be able to sare me with these documents too?
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes sir but is it possible if l will share the Statement of Entry another day as it is at the centre that we are using for our examinations
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 359 5826: *center
06/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, dear. Please share me with the other remaining documents.
06/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes sir! l have sent them but my network is quite poor.
06/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 359 5826: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand. I shall wait for the same.
06/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 359 5826: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Good Evening Sir 
Have you received the documents?
06/11/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes  I was. Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The information is accurate sir.
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you sir
Its so unfortunate that l could not connect to you earlier due to the usual challenge but hopefully the following sessions will proceed smoothly
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Afternoon,Kudakwashe is experiencing network challenges.I think we can start without him if it's okay with you.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Yes ,sure!
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process
08/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Noted!
08/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Acknowledged!
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Yes he did!
08/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Yes sir!
08/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
08/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
08/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Yes l have.So you have not added the registration fee on the total annual  fee because we will subtract it from the total annual fee🤷🏾‍♀️
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct and I am happy to see that you are paying genuine attention to our session. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
08/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
08/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Following
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Noted!
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
08/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Noted!
08/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 777 2056: No questions so far.... everything is clear!
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Very excited!
08/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Impressive!
08/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
08/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 777 2056: We can proceed to the detail.
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
08/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Really glad to hear that!
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 71 359 5826: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 777 2056: That's very good news! It is also convenient to us and will help us plan financially.
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright.
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
08/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: I have a question sir!
On which platform will the Offer Letter from the University be sent on?
08/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Crystal clear!
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Am loving this !
08/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for the day now. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and wi be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the *"Festival of Lights."* It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

14/11/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update, and I completely understand. I hope Kudakwashe's revision sessions go well, and there's no need to apologize for any inconveniences. Family commitments and academic priorities come first.
14/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Thank you for understanding sir!
21/11/23, 7:53 am - +263 71 359 5826: Hello everyone!
How have you been?
It's so unfortunate that l was unavailable for a while due to exams and my cellphone was not operating well as well but l'm done with my exams and l'm hopeful that our sessions will be held smoothly.My apologies for any inconveniences caused.
21/11/23, 7:54 am - +263 71 359 5826: Is it okay if l send the Statement of Entry now?
21/11/23, 7:57 am - +263 71 359 5826: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. It is alright, I understand the challenges. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Good Evening Sir!

I'm happy to proceed with our session.
21/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from evening onwards and continue with this session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 7:33 am - +263 77 229 7277: Good Morning Sir!

Sorry l could not connect with you yesterday during your availability hours due to power shortages which resulted in network unavailability.
22/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Good Evening Sir!

I'm ready for today's session.
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
22/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes Sir l recall...we discussed about The Statement of Purpose but the other sessions that l was unavailable, l went through them and have no questions pertaining to those
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The sessions were about  counselling on university submission and the registration  process.You had that session with my sister but l went through the messages thoroughly.
22/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with further continuation - *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 359 5826: No sir its crystal clear.
22/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
22/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 71 359 5826: I'm not quite aware of it.Can you please explain further?
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes sir!
Thank you for explaining.
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Definitely!
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 359 5826: True
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you.
Have a wonderful night as well.
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Evening sir ,how are you?
23/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking.May I knwo if you are ready to proceed with the session?
23/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Am Kudakwashe 's sister.cant get through to him,we can proceed .he will catch up with us when he is available.
23/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 777 2056: We live in different cities.
23/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Am sure power and network issues.
23/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, 
Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
23/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
23/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Good Evening Sir, its Kudakwashe

I'm happy to begin our session!
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes Sir!
