I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

08/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. How are you doing today?
30/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parent.

I have received an insight that you wanted to inquire about Anodiwa's admission process and payment. However, I was hoping to discuss the same with you here in the admission group. Unfortunately with repeated reminders I received no response from your end. So if you are currently available now. Shall we proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers and their parents, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
06/11/23, 6:05 am - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you Sheevjet for your kind gesture. Am sorry for the inc9nveniences that couod have been caused by our inconsistences as regards attending our admissions sessions. We as Anodiwa's proud Edoof8an parents mentioned earlier that we are sole traders usually we are always out of network working from hand to mouth. Anything that requires out attention as parents might have slipped through the fingers mostly because we will either be out of data or network. Im.usually driving nearly daily for the most part of the day do in Zimbabwe we experience serious intermittent internet network problems. However am sure ad from the *16th of November 2023* Anodiwa will vlbe through with her final examinations and we as her parents would be prepared to proceed with the 1hour sessions without any problems. Please kindly bear with us and allow us to proceed with the sessions as from the 16th of November 2023. Thank you in advance👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
06/11/23, 6:08 am - +263 71 291 4917: However, as I  asked from Saloni earlier on, we are prepared to get a copy of our great daughter's admission breakdown so we can schedule all the payments plan in advance as we await her final results.
06/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding and for providing this update. I completely understand that you may have some challenges due to network issues and your busy schedules. It's great to hear that Anodiwa will be finishing her final examinations on the 16th of November 2023, and you'll be ready to proceed with the sessions after that date.

Regarding your request for Anodiwa's admission breakdown, we can certainly provide you with that information. When we proceed with the session.
06/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. We will surely await to get all finer details as  early as possible 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

13/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I think maybe in mid January Ma'am
13/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, in that case you need to connect with your school and ask them to provide you the statement of entry for your exams in which they should mention you subject combination. I hope you understand?
13/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am let me look for it
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I have reviewed them ma'am
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 694 6404: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect @263716946404
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/12/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 May I know dear if you have taken a note of my messages?
13/12/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I am looking forward for your response however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anodiwa, Wishing you a good day!

During our session yesterday, we were looking forward for your response as we have not received your response. I would like to know if you are available for the discussion now so that we can move ahead with your admission journey?
14/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes l have ma'am
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263716946404. May I know if you are ready for the session please?
14/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Good afternoon
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes um ready lets continue
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let's continue with the second benefit of Endowment Plan
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes it does
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750 , this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
14/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 Are we still connected?
15/12/23, 5:23 am - +263 71 694 6404: Ma'am it was raining this side so we had no network .
Um sorry for the inconvenience caused
15/12/23, 5:26 am - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 5:26 am - +263 71 694 6404: Good morning
15/12/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anodiwa, I hope you are doing well.
15/12/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you had network challenges yesterday. May I know if you are available now for the session ?
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263716946404
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are available for the session?
15/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes l am available
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, Let's proceed with the fourth benefit of Endowment Plan.
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

15/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 694 6404: No ma'am l was not aware but l be delighted if u highlight me
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
15/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
15/12/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/12/23, 10:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
