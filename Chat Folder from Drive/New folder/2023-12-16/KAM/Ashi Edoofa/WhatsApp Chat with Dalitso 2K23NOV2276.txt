30/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/11/23, 4:38 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Your very much welcome
30/11/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

30/11/23, 4:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/11/23, 4:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/11/23, 4:56 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: They very much clear
30/11/23, 4:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/11/23, 4:59 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am ready to move forward with the discussions
30/11/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/11/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
30/11/23, 5:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes u may share the videos
30/11/23, 5:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265992606054 I am sharing the videos with you and I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
30/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:03 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Very excited
30/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265992606054 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/11/23, 5:07 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: An hour will be more than enough for me to watch and give a summary of what I was able to understand
30/11/23, 5:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once you complete the videos, please share your response
30/11/23, 5:14 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay will do so
30/11/23, 5:48 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: In the first video it’s to my understanding that the founders said that the Edoofa program boosts the confidence of Edoofians and gives them the feeling of independence. They carried on to say that when they came to Africa they studied successful people as well as the failures so that they understand the difference between the two groups of people.
They explained a story about a kid who wanted to make calculators. So he contacted the CEO of Hp computers and asked for spare parts. The CEO was interested in him so the CEO of Hp computers help steve jobs to realize he potential. The founders also stated that the best way to understand and stay on track with the program is to follow instructions and be open minded.
30/11/23, 5:48 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: In the second video the founders talk about the vision that Edoofa has for me as the applicant. They also talked about a student from Ghana who registered on the edoofa program. They said that after he was accepted and granted a scholarship through Edoofa he told them his heartbreaking story when he was scammed by an agent that made him pay $1000 for enrolment fees to a Chinese university. After avoiding the student for 3 months, the agent asked for $300 more as a shipment fee for the student’s documents that were allegedly in China.
30/11/23, 5:48 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: In the fourth video they talk about the next step, which is the Statement of Purpose. They also said that when they are contacting  multiple universities, they send three things which include my documents, Edoofa's recommendations and the insights gathered from the counselling sessions and Statement of Purpose. The Statement of Purpose is used to create the best first impression. This is were I am supposed to explain who I am, my skills and achievements. They also instructed me to be smart and I should not delay when filling the form
30/11/23, 6:07 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: The founders talk about the stage 5 of the Edoofa cycle which talks about university interactions. 

As any parent would want a good education for their child the Edoofa program as this its students as their and offer the best colleges and universities with well teaching systems and including its environment as they want the best of the best 

The aim is to build up a students ability to express themselves and work along with others as the co-founders said what good is a degree if u can’t put your ideas out there and prove that your the best among the many.
30/11/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265992606054 You have gathered great insights from the videos. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
30/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
30/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
30/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
30/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: The videos were very clear and well explained so yes I agree and understand
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic @265992606054 Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
30/11/23, 6:18 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes we are
30/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:00 PM.
30/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
30/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
30/11/23, 6:22 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Will do so
30/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have seen the questions and would be able to complete the tasks in 4 hours or less
30/11/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the documents and forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
30/11/23, 6:33 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you very much and will be looking forward to the next session
30/11/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265992606054
30/11/23, 10:11 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 3:28 am - +265 992 60 60 54: 2.First off, entrepreneurship can help improve the standard of living for individuals and communities by creating new businesses and jobs. This means more opportunities for people to work and earn a living, which can make life better for everyone. It can also help reduce poverty by giving people the chance to lift themselves up and improve their financial situation.

Secondly, entrepreneurship can drive economic growth and increase the overall income of a country. When people start businesses and make them successful, it can boost the country's economy as a whole. This means more money flowing into the country and more opportunities for everyone to earn a good income.

Next, entrepreneurship encourages innovation and creativity. When people start their own businesses, they often come up with new ideas, products, and services that can meet the needs and wants of consumers. This not only improves people's lives, but it also helps solve social and economic problems.

Additionally, entrepreneurship can enhance competition and make markets more efficient. When new businesses enter the market, it can lead to lower prices, better quality products, and more choices for consumers. This healthy competition can benefit everyone and make the economy stronger.

Lastly, entrepreneurship can contribute to community development and social change. When entrepreneurs invest in their local communities, it can improve the infrastructure, services, and amenities available. It can also empower women and marginalized groups, giving them the opportunity to succeed and make a positive impact.
01/12/23, 3:30 am - +265 992 60 60 54: 3.GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are a set of rules and standards for financial reporting. They're super important because they make sure that financial information is clear, consistent, and comparable across different businesses and industries. GAAP is followed by most public companies in the U.S. and is managed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 

Why is GAAP so crucial? Well, first, it helps investors and stakeholders make informed decisions based on reliable financial info. Second, it helps companies maintain trust with shareholders, creditors, customers, and regulators. Third, it helps companies avoid legal issues that can come from inaccurate financial statements. And fourth, it improves internal controls and management practices.

Basically, GAAP is like a common language for financial info. It's always changing to fit the needs of the business world, so it's important for companies to stay updated and follow GAAP rules. It keeps things fair and transparent for everyone involved.
01/12/23, 3:36 am - +265 992 60 60 54: 4. Accounting standards act as a rulebook for recording and reporting financial information. They're incredibly important because they ensure everyone is on the same page when it comes to money matters. These standards protect the interests of investors, regulators, and the public, while also promoting honesty and transparency in the accounting profession and business community. Additionally, they facilitate smooth collaboration among global financial markets. Without accounting standards, things could get pretty messy in the financial world. That's why we rely on authorities like the SEC, FASB, and IASB to enforce these standards and maintain fairness and reliability. So, you can see how crucial it is to have these guidelines in place! They're like the backbone of financial reporting, helping us make informed decisions and maintain trust in the system.
01/12/23, 3:40 am - +265 992 60 60 54: 5. Accounting is all about keeping track of financial activities, measuring them, and then reporting them to show how well a company is doing. On the other hand, auditing is all about double-checking and evaluating the accuracy of those financial statements.

Accountants are responsible for preparing important financial documents like balance sheets and income statements. They make sure to follow specific accounting standards while doing so. Auditors, on the other hand, review these statements to make sure they meet auditing standards.

Accounting is an ongoing process that involves recording and maintaining daily transactions. It's like a continuous cycle. Auditing, on the other hand, is done periodically. It involves reviewing and assessing the financial statements to ensure everything is in order.
01/12/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Dalitso, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for the next step?
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes am ready for the next step
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (5-Dec-2023).
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/L8Sr3HyHEu6IS8d5lqjDGe
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Kamtimaleka Dalitso Steve, and my EWYL group name is Dalitso EWYL23E0964. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (5-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
01/12/23, 1:08 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay will do so , am just waiting on my parents who seem to be offline at the moment
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - +265 991 33 54 43: Good afternoon
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @265991335443, I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Shall we continue please?
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes we may
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - +265 991 33 54 43: Thanks
01/12/23, 1:25 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes that’s accurate
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
01/12/23, 1:32 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yeah that’s true
01/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
01/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
01/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it was addressed
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
01/12/23, 1:56 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes we are .
01/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
01/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
01/12/23, 2:01 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yea i have
01/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
01/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
01/12/23, 2:16 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Have gone through the details and have an understanding of the process and requirements
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/12/23, 2:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay am following
01/12/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/12/23, 2:53 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: No it’s all clear
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: This is really admirable and truly exciting
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Dalitso. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/12/23, 3:04 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am really glad to hear that and have to say your drive to ensure the best quality higher education to your students is a blessing on it’s on
01/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: We may proceed
01/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/12/23, 3:14 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s ensuring.
01/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/12/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/12/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/12/23, 3:21 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it does .
01/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
01/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/12/23, 3:26 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yea it does.
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am following through
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/12/23, 3:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have an understanding of both but if my parents should have any queries I think they will address it .
01/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

15/12/23, 5:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

  2. After the sponsorship the annual accommodation fee adds up to 0 dollars 

  3. Annual fee is 1250 dollars 

  4.  They both add up to 250 dollars together 

   5. 1000 dollars is to be paid to secure the scholarship seat
15/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 5:34 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s truly an amazing offer and great opportunity
15/12/23, 5:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that @265992606054 . As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 5:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/12/23, 5:44 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it does . 

And does this fee have to be paid all at once or can be paid in installments?
15/12/23, 5:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Yes please, These fees can be paid in installment, we will give you more detail about this soon.

15/12/23, 5:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 5:56 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: We may proceed
15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it is clear
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1500. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1500- $1000 = $500, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it does thanks for the clarification
15/12/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @265992606054. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 6:29 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes please explain
15/12/23, 6:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yeah the details are clear
15/12/23, 6:47 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: A small question_ when should we expect the offer letter release?
15/12/23, 6:49 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: And to add on that , should we assume this is the only offer letter we are receiving?
15/12/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265888352425 I am not able to understand your query as your offer letter is already out, could you please elaborate your concern please?
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: My concern is that you indicated that you got the offer letter from the University that is why you were able to share with us so that it can facilitate todays discussions. My thinking was that we will get official communication from the university and possibly that is when the 15 days count down will start. Please help to clarify on this. Thanks.
15/12/23, 7:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know regarding your offer letter. I understand your concern and would like to assure you that the offer letter has already been sent to your inbox. I kindly request you to check your inbox and confirm the same with me here please.
15/12/23, 7:46 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: Thanks so much for your response. We will check about email and get back to u. Thanks
15/12/23, 7:46 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I checked my inbox haven’t received it yet
15/12/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, In that case please share your alternative email id with me so that we can request the university to share the offer letter with you. I hope you understand?
15/12/23, 8:03 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: skamtimaleka@gmail.com
15/12/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the id with us, let me share the same with the team. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 8:07 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: We are in Malawi not zimbabwe
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265992606054, Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
15/12/23, 8:31 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: We will use telegraphic transfer through national bank.

Or might try using a dollar account of someone outside of Malawi
15/12/23, 8:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265992606054, Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 8:38 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: You may proceed to share the insights
