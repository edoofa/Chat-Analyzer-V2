22/11/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Evening sir
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 448 6799: We may start
22/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 733 5006: Good evening sir we can proceed
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Yes , they are clear
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Indeed I am following
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Understood sir
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Indeed we may proceed
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Let's move forward
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Goodnight to you too
23/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 448 6799: I do not think I'll be able to proceed as my internet connection is very low
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Good afternoon to you sir
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 448 6799: I am now available for the session
25/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the videos?
25/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Yes I was
25/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: The first one is about eligibility whereby an Edoofian is supposed to follow Edoofa ways , be teachable
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Also one has to be open minded
25/11/23, 1:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, please carry on!
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 448 6799: From the second video , the first issue which was discussed is about reliability taking from the story mentioned about the Chinese scholarship, Edoofa is always giving feedbacks so that one will be able to trace the progress
25/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Also students are taught to be responsible and independent that they may work out something on their own without troubling parents leading to maturation of their minds
25/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 448 6799: There is also emphasis on the issue of following rules
25/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please carry on with the last video, please
25/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: On SOP , I'll be using the achievements I have whereas the board will be giving recommendations to the schools. For my achievements, I'll be using my certificates . The SOP is said to be my only subjective document giving me a unique advantage on the course
27/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Very well I thank you. How are you today?
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 448 6799: I do agree and I got to understand better including some points I missed out .
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 2) Zimbabwe lately has been developing better as compared to previous years and all thanks to the president by the implementation of NDS1. Indeed people still face challenges in the road to success .There are many ways that a geographer could contribute to Zimbabwe's development.One way would be to conduct research on the country's natural resources, including minerals, water, and arable land. This research could help inform policies around the sustainable use of these resources. A geographer could also work to improve the country's infrastructure, like roads and railways, which would help connect people and increase economic activity. Additionally, I could use my skills to help plan and develop cities and towns in a way that promotes sustainable growth. I could also help with disaster preparedness and response in Zimbabwe. I can use their knowledge of geography and data analysis to help predict and prepare for natural disasters like floods and droughts. They can also help with the relief and recovery efforts after a disaster has occurred. Additionally I could help develop strategies to address the issue of urban poverty in Zimbabwe. This could involve studying the spatial distribution of poverty and identifying areas that are most in need of assistance. So, there are many ways a geographer could help Zimbabwe!
 I could definitely help with issues of trade and environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Zimbabwe. On the trade front, I can use their expertise to study the country's trade patterns and identify opportunities for increasing trade and economic development. They can also help to identify any barriers to trade and recommend ways to overcome them. In terms of EIAs, I can help to assess the environmental impacts of development projects, like mining or agricultural projects, and recommend ways to mitigate any negative impacts. All in all, as a geographer I have a lot to offer when it comes to issues of trade and the spatial distribution of benefits and costs.I can help to study how the benefits and costs of trade are distributed across different areas, and can recommend ways to ensure that all regions of the country benefit from trade. This is particularly important in a country like Zimbabwe, which has a high level of regional inequality. In partnership with other geographers, we can also study how trade can be used to promote regional development and reduce poverty.
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 3)The relationship between humans and the environment is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, humans depend on the environment for basic needs like food, water, and shelter. On the other hand, human activities like agriculture, industry, and urbanization can have significant impacts on the environment. So, it's a two-way relationship, with humans both relying on the environment and affecting it in turn. It's important for humans to understand and respect the environment, in order to ensure a sustainable future for both people and the planet. The human-environment relationship involves many different aspects, from environmental ethics to sustainability. One important issue is the impact of human activities on the environment. Activities like deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have negative effects on the environment, and can lead to the loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction. On the other hand, humans have also made positive contributions to the environment, such as through environmental conservation and restoration efforts. So, it's a complex and dynamic relationship, with both positive and negative effects. . Sustainable development is about finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. It's about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This can involve things like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and the circular economy. The idea is to create a system that's not just focused on short-term gains, but that also takes the long-term health of the planet into account.
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 4From a geographical perspective, places are connected in many ways. Firstly, there are physical connections, like the natural features that connect one place to another, like rivers and mountain ranges. There are also cultural connections, like the exchange of ideas, goods, and people between different places. And there are also economic connections, like trade and investment. And finally, there are political connections, like international agreements and treaties. These connections make it so that what happens in one place can have a ripple effect that reaches other places far away. Let's start with economic connections. One example is trade, where countries exchange goods and services with each other. This has a big impact on local economies and even the global economy. Another economic connection is investment, where businesses and governments invest in other countries, creating jobs and opportunities. Another example is tourism, where people visit different places and bring in revenue to the local economy. These economic connections can be very positive, but they can also have negative effects, like environmental damage and economic inequality.One example is international organizations like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization. These organizations bring together countries to solve problems and create policies. They also help to keep the peace and promote human rights. Another example is international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, there are also things like military alliances, which connect countries for security reasons. One interesting example is the concept of nation-states. A nation-state is a country that's made up of a single nation, or group of people who share the same culture and history. These countries can be very strong and influential, like the United States or China. Nation-states can have a big impact on other countries, through things like diplomacy, military force, or cultural influence. Another interesting political concept is the idea of globalization, where countries become more connected and interdependent.  Interdependence is the idea that countries are linked together, and that they can't function without each other. For example, many countries depend on each other for natural resources, like oil or food. Many also depend on each other for things like trade and investment. There are also cultural interdependencies, like the spread of popular culture around the world. This idea of interdependence means that countries can be very affected by what happens in other countries, like when there's a global recession or a pandemic.
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 5)GIS stands for "geographic information system." It's a technology that's used to capture, store, analyze, and display geographic data. This data can be things like population density, elevation, or climate. GIS is important because it allows us to visualize and understand data in a way that's not possible with traditional methods. For example, we can use GIS to map the spread of a disease, or to see how climate change is affecting a certain area. GIS has become an essential tool for governments, businesses, and researchers to make better decisions and solve problems.One important use of GIS is in emergency management. During natural disasters like hurricanes or wildfires, GIS can be used to track the event and coordinate relief efforts. For example, GIS can be used to create evacuation plans, or to see where resources are needed most. Another important use of GIS is in urban planning. GIS can be used to create models of urban areas, and to test different scenarios, like traffic patterns or the location of new housing developments. This helps cities make better decisions about how to use their resources and plan for growth. Another important use of GIS is in agriculture. Farmers and agricultural organizations can use GIS to make decisions about things like where to plant crops, how to manage irrigation, and how to monitor crop health. GIS can also be used to track things like soil conditions, weather patterns, and pests. Another use of GIS is in public health. GIS can be used to track disease outbreaks, identify risk factors, and plan public health interventions.

12/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank you very much madam. What I want to know is that, are we going to pay his fees on monthly basis or we will wait until you confirm you have secured him a place at the University.
12/12/23, 2:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263775401325, as the admissions for the August 2024 academic intake are now open, the student will be starting the university admission process. Once offered a scholarship by the university, the next step involves paying the university registration fee, which is a part of the first-year university expenses. Given that Mr. Shivjeet is currently unavailable and you appear to be available for the session, would you like me to assist you in connecting with one of our admission officers who can guide you through the further procedures?
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 540 1325: It's ok madam, it will help me and the family to budget for Clive's fees
12/12/23, 3:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me help you connect with Ms. Ashi, our admission officer. While Mr. Shivjeet is away, she will guide you through the procedures.
12/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank yóu
12/12/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Clive, 

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to have a conversation with you.

On the same note, I would like to schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02:00 PM, If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 02:00 PM to 06:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
12/12/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For now,  I wish you a blessed night ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
13/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Clive, Wishing you a good day!
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With reference to my above message, I was looking forward for your response. On the same note, I would like to know if you are available for the discussion, could you please share your response?
13/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 540 1325: I will be available from 2pm
13/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Afternoon madam
13/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes am available now
13/12/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @263775401325, Thank you for letting me know that you are ready for the discussion. 

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Geography)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes it's correct
13/12/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263775401325, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/12/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/12/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/12/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Understood thanks
13/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263775401325, Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
13/12/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
13/12/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
13/12/23, 8:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 540 1325: I have taken note
13/12/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/12/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
14/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Clive, Wishing you a good day!

During our session yesterday, we were looking forward for your response as we have not received your response. I would like to know if you are available for the discussion now so that we can move ahead with your admission journey?
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes am available, good afternoon
14/12/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your reponse @263775401325, Before we start our today's discussion, May I know if you have taken a note of my above messages regarding the fees break up?
14/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
14/12/23, 4:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that @263775401325. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank you, understood
14/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 540 1325: How long can it take him to get an offer so that as pareñts we can budget for his registration fees if he succeed to get a scholarship
14/12/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'll be more than happy to assist you here, and I appreciate your approach as with this you can start preparing your finances. We will be able to share the offer letter in the coming week most probably.
14/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank u very much, confirm if we use Mr Kawadza's F. B. C's account it will be around US$1250.00
14/12/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263775401325, Please don't worry as we will inform you regarding the same at the time of payment so that we can share the latest update with you. On this note, May I know if we can proceed with the session?
14/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
14/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank you very much, one of the student is my neighbor's child and it makes me  confident that my child will be safe during his stay in India.
14/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263775401325, I am happy to hear that you have found the familiar face in the picture.
14/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Am pleased to hear that as a parent.
14/12/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/12/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/12/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/12/23, 6:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes I have.
14/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Clive, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his seat before the competition even begins. He will be the trailblazer among his peers, firmly positioning himself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Understood
14/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
14/12/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
14/12/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
14/12/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/12/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/12/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes I have followed and there is nothing I want to inquire
14/12/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/12/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Clive, Wishing you a good day!
15/12/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to our conversation yesterday, I was waiting for your response. Could you please let me know if you have gone through my message? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes I have gone through, good afternoon.
15/12/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in that case could you please share your response regarding the same? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 540 1325: No am no familiar
15/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
15/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
15/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
15/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Thank you, understood
15/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes
15/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes I agree.
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
15/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Well understood
15/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
15/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
15/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 540 1325: Yes it's clear
15/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
