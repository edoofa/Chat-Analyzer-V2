09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your warm wishes, and I am glad to know that you are available to connect with us now. Coming to the queries that I was unable to attend as I was not available due to my illness, let me help you have a better understanding now, as we move ahead with Step 4 in your admission cycle, we will now start preparing for your application @263773564124 and then share your applications with the Universities, and before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes but l wanted to change my program if possible ma'am
09/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, it is possible Natasha, however, could you please let me know the reason behind the changing of course why do you wish to change your course now, please?
09/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I did much research and l concluded Risk Management is better offer for me and just to go with the trending time we in .Bcom offers accounting but am not feeling it l feel like l won't do my best in it since my passion is being diverted to Risk Management
09/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me Natasha. I understand where you are coming from. If I were in your place, I would have had the same thought process. 

However, over the years, I have gained enough experience in the education and management industry to help you understand that students tend to make the same mistake as yours while choosing their courses.
09/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A Bachelor in Commerce *(B.Com)* can establish a strong foundation for a career in risk management, let me also let you know that Risk Management is not a field, but rather a sub-field in Commerce and you will also be studying the same in your course. Here's how a B.Com can be advantageous for a risk management career:
09/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Comprehending Business Principles:* B.Com encompasses a broad spectrum of business-related subjects such as economics, accounting, business law, marketing, and management. Grasping the fundamental principles and operations of a business is vital in risk management.

*Financial Expertise:* Risk management often entails financial analysis and decision-making. B.Com equips you with essential financial knowledge, encompassing areas like financial statement analysis, risk evaluation, and investment principles.
09/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Risk Assessment and Analysis*: B.Com programs frequently include courses that delve into risk assessment and analysis. These courses help you comprehend the various types of risks that businesses encounter, the methodologies for assessing them, and strategies to mitigate these risks.

*Legal and Regulatory Insight:* B.Com programs incorporate business law, which is pivotal for understanding the legal aspects related to risk management.
09/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Problem-Solving and Decision-Making Abilities:* B.Com programs emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. These capabilities are crucial for analyzing risks, identifying potential issues, and proposing suitable solutions.

*Communication Proficiency:* B.Com programs frequently concentrate on enhancing communication skills, both written and verbal which lead to effective communication that plays a vital role in risk management to convey risks and mitigation strategies to stakeholders.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Wow l understand better
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Teamwork and Collaborative Skills:* B.Com programs include collaborative projects and activities that enhance your capacity to work efficiently in a team, a vital skill in risk management.

*Internship Opportunities:* Numerous B.Com programs offer internship opportunities in areas such as finance, accounting, or related fields. These internships can provide valuable exposure to real-world business operations and risk management practices.
09/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I wont change then
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To specialize in risk management, you may consider pursuing further studies or certifications like a Master's in Risk Management, Certified Risk Manager *(CRM)*, or Financial Risk Manager *(FRM)* certification. These options can enhance your expertise and marketability within the field of risk management after you have set your roots and gained enough practical experience from B.com.
09/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Natasha. I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Confirmed
09/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

09/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay noted

09/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 356 4124: On the university admission Edoofa applies for students into reputable and excellent universities  thereby the student awaits the reply from the prospective universities .If they reply the student is supposed to pay university admission fee of $500-$750 within a stated period
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
09/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
09/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 356 4124: How long might it take
09/10/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are active, our discussion will only take your 1 hour of time.
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Was coming from school
09/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Am now at home
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I don't mean the session l mean the university admission process
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the universities are able to generate the offer letter within a week's time, once we are through with the discussion all your queries will be covered ahead.
09/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay noted Ms Kirti
09/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Am glad and now relieved
09/10/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l am
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Ms Kirti!
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted ma'am
09/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 356 4124: We can proceed
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
09/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I wanted to ask that wah if l dnt get the cut off points needed
09/10/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, also we do have the necessary benefits, that will help you, as we move ahead and discuss this in detail. So may I know if you are ready to proceed ahead?
09/10/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
09/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Can you explain further
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*


On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Natasha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Wow that's huge
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Well explained
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes it does
09/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I am following
09/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 356 4124: More information if possible
09/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
09/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted
09/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Very well explained
09/10/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
09/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I agree with u
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Do l redo the payments
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, that is the benefit here, that without the repayments you will be able to join the batch of 2025, I hope we are clear now?
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 356 4124: P 
Yes
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well, since we were not able to continue with our discussion earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 344 0122: Gud afternoon  we are fine
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you are clear so far?
10/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l am
10/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes we are
10/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 356 4124: No l dnt have any query
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l am
10/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: If l may ask which university is this
10/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773564124 we would now be sharing your application with the universities so as soon as we receive an update about the offer letter we shall let you know.
10/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay noted l was just relating with the seats you mentioned
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted thank you and have a great day
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Evening Ms Kirti
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I want to talk to you if possible
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263773564124 It is a pleasure to connect with you again, yes please share your thoughts of concerns?
10/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 356 4124: What my parents are facing challenges in completing the university admission fee is there an alternative
10/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Can they be given some time to arrange for the money
10/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that covering the university admission fee can be challenging for some families, however, could you please help me understand which university admission fee are you referring to since your intake is for 2024, and right now your only focus is to register yourself with the University with the registration fee of $750 which to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

And with the help of the Endownment program, you even experience Financial ease as well of the $150 grant which Edoofa will be covering and direct towards the university on your behalf, and you will only be required to pay $600 that also in two installments the first $300 to be paid within 15 days of receiving the letter to reserve your seat and the other $300 after a month, thereby completing the total as $750.
10/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So could you please let me clearly understand where are you facing challenges since we at Edoofa, think for your welfare first and then come up with this solution to ease your parent's burden?
10/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Am referring to the $750  registration fee for University.
You said the university will reply in 4 to 5 days and then that's when half of the $600 left is to be paid within 15days after Edoofa has covered $150 of that amount .
So my question what if my parents exceeds 15 days to gather the money since as we all know our Zimbabwe economy is in dispair .
They are really trying their best but my dad has been at home for a month something is up at his work place so he wanted to know what if he doesn't raise the money in time what will be be the outcome
10/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773564124 I understand your concern here, however, if they exceed the deadline they would have to state a valid reason for that as well, and some genuine reasons are taken under consideration and the academic board does allow them extensions. 

However, please know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, and share it with multiple universities which means every university will take its time accordingly, please. So please do not worry.
10/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I don't understand Ma'am
Am sorry might seem like bothering you
10/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Does it mean the whole might take month or 2
10/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773564124 no please you are not bothering me, I am more than happy to assist you. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
10/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application will be prepared and since we will share your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from many universities. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities will evaluate your application. I hope we are together with this?
10/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted so in short it is possible that the universities might take up to next year to reply
10/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I can suggest universities also
10/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No that will not be the case, as I mentioned we share your application with multiple universities so at least one of them would offer you a scholarship.
10/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay noted so about the money l should worry yet
10/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now coming back to your query @263773564124 as you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, so let me share the importance of registering yourself with at least one university.  In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by University B you would lose out on the scholarship from University B and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, there is a transfer option available to the students. May I know if you are aware of that?
10/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Ms Kirti so what am l expecting in the next few days
10/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: No
10/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 356 4124: What if l register with B n then A responds
10/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve your scholarship seat at University A by paying your registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if you receive a better scholarship offer and decide to change your university, you will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that the University A offer is still the better choice, you can pursue your education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for your academic journey.
10/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope we are clear now?
10/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Very clear😊
10/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Have a great night ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
10/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I will definitely do
Same to you have a great night
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natasha.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
19/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 356 4124: Noted
19/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 356 4124: 1.1800 us
2.3years
3.500-750us
4.300us
19/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Now, on that note, when it comes to point number one, may you please take a look at the letter again and let me know of the correct amount. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 356 4124: 1.900
19/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 356 4124: 1.900us
19/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
19/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 356 4124: Noted
19/10/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 356 4124: Yes we are
19/10/23, 11:50 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 356 4124: We can move on
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I am clear on that
19/10/23, 12:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
19/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes are good
19/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 356 4124: So the 750 us is paid in instalments right
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 356 4124: We are
19/10/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l am in Harare
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Noted
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Ok
19/10/23, 12:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes please
19/10/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 356 4124: So l can actually send the amount again to Mr Charles
19/10/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, you can do that.
19/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 356 4124: What the charges for him
19/10/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: As I mentioned here, the charges are 12.5% of the amount that you would be paying.
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Mr Rajah is more affordable
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, you can use that mode as well. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 356 4124: So will l have to go to Masvingo
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, if you want to pay through Mr. Charles, you can do it anywhere from FBC Bank.
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 356 4124: What about if it's on campus
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay noted Mr Milan
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 356 4124: What do l say to Mr Rajah
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 356 4124: He said how do l assist you
19/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: You can let him know that you wish to pay the university registration fee please.
19/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Oky
19/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 356 4124: So l only got accepted at Galgotias
19/10/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes we are
19/10/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 356 4124: No
19/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, I believe you are clear about how the admission process is navigated, right?
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes
19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, before we move ahead, I believe you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes , l am
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natasha!

19/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I was recently reviewing your Scholarship Application File, and I observed that you have secured your scholarship seat with Galgotias University by paying your first part of the your registration fees which is $50, and the remaining amount for the same fee which is $592 is due by 28th November, 2023.

Since the deadline date is just around the corner, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity? Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $592 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?

My dad is not in the country due to work and mom will reply soon she just went to funeral and in couple of hours she will back

24/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yah
27/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natasha, I hope you are doing well. 

With respect to our last conversation, I was hoping to receive an update from your end, however we didn't received your response. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you to know if you had the chance to connect with your parents, Could you please share your response with us?
27/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 356 4124: My parents suggested that l reapply next year since our finances are not yet stable 
My father just got a job and hasn't received his salary yrt
27/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern that your finances are not unstable because of which you are thinking to reapply next year. Being your admission officer, I would not suggest you to delay your Higher Education. I remember the other day, that you mentioned about making the payment on 7th of December to complete your registration process, May I please know if my understanding was incorrect?
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes it was but we discussed with my parents l have a little brother who is starting form 1 of which their results are coming out this week and it's about $500 for him to get admission for January intake and they also have me so they decided to start with my little whose starting school earlier than me and the l will be next
So l think and they saying money will be available for you month end of January after completing your little brother's payment of school since his starting high school
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from Natasha, The plans you and your parents are planning are fine. Although, as you remember that you have taken your admission for 2024 because of which you have been provided a grant of $150 with the help of Endowment Benefits. However, If you are planning to continue your Higher Education in the next year, you will ended up losing this grant which will increase financial burden on your parents.
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Also, your cost of education will be revised according to the 2025 intake which would increase the cost of education upto 40%. Hence, As you admission officer, I would like you to rethink regarding this decision as delaying your Higher Education is not the right option. I hope you understand that if you start your academic journey in August, 2025 you will graduate in the year of 2028, if your course duration is 3 years. By this time, I am sure your brother will be pursuing his upper levels which may lead to more financial burden on your parents.
27/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: On the other note, If you start your journey now, you will be able to contribute to your parents financially as in the third year you will be given the internship opportunities. Moreover, You have EWYL program with the help of which you can pay your tuition fees which can help you in reducing the financial burden. Please share your thoughts on this,
27/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 344 0122: We understood you   give me a day to discuss this with my husband pliz

05/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in response Natasha, I had an unexpected call because of this I couldn't attend to your message. Also, addressing the messages shared by you earlier Natasha, I did not get you well regarding the query you shared for the refund? Your application for a scholarship has already been processed after which you were able to secure your scholarship seat and hold the same till you complete your remaining formalities and hence it is non refundable as per the procedures. May I know what happened because of which you had the same query?
05/12/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: While you share your response to the same, let me address your query regarding the payment modes. If you are planning to make the payment from South Africa in rands, there are two modes available -

1. Telegraphic Transfer - If you have an International Nostro Bank Account or a Visa Card, using the same you would be able to make the deposit directly to India. The details of the same are mentioned in your offer letter and you can use those. The transfer charges for the Telegraphic Transfer will be notified to you by the bank you use. 

2. Mama Money - If you are planning to make the payment in Rands, that can be done using Mama Money. The transfer charges for the same mode is zero percentage and hence this is the most feasible mode in case one plans to make the payment from South Africa. For this mode, we will share a Mama Money Order and using the reference id mentioned in the same, you will be able to make the deposit in cash at any of the Mama Money stores in your locality.
05/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Okay will tell him
05/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Ma parents where asking if they cant pay the money so it's a loss for them right
05/12/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your thoughts dear, however I believe your parents are now ready to make the payment, is that correct?
05/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 356 4124: My father asked mi to inquire about the means he can use to pay
05/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Whilst he is in South Africa
05/12/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear. As we have shared above about the mode of payment your father can use in order to make the payment while he is South Africa. Let me reshare them with you.
