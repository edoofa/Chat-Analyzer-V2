The head of a government in a parliamentary system is usually a prime minister whereas in a presidential system the head is a president. On the other hand, the prime minister i directly accountable to the Parliament, whereby in a presidential system the head or president is not directly accountable to the legislature. The government in a parliamentary system can be dissolved by a vote of no confidence but in a presidential system, the president term of office is fixed not subject to vote of no confidence. To add on, in a parliamentary system, the government is formed by a coalition or majority, whereas in a presidential system, the president forms the government and appoint cabinet ministers. It can also be noted that in a parliamentary system, the government is responsible for both legislative and executive functions while in a presidential system, there is separation of powers between executive and legislative branches. To sum up, the prime minister can dissolve a parliament and call for new elections, whereas the president in a presidential system has no mandate to dissolve the legislature or call for elections.

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to Masket's journey.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
04/11/23, 12:35 pm - +27 81 046 0123: The discipline of political science is fundamentally concerned with the political nature of problems of a nation and the world, determining lasting solutions and concerns such as how a society can be distinctly be constituted and reproduced in the backdrop of conflicts of interest between diverse social groups and how to choose the best political and philosophical principles so as to realise better policies, programmes  and options in terms of distributive justice are at the core of political science. The subject also focuses on nature and strature of the government as a decision making process of those who press their claims on it.Having mentioned the above, our country has not achieved much in this direction, social unrest, corruption, violation of human rights in broad daylight, constitutional reforms, electoral reforms to mention but a few. With my career, I am looking forward to educating the public from grassroots level on all the above matters from any platform available, spearheading global awareness campaigns and out reach programs to people from all walks of life.

04/11/23, 4:02 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes Sir
04/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Political Science)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/11/23, 4:50 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes Sir
04/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 5:01 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/11/23, 5:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/11/23, 5:02 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 5:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/11/23, 5:03 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/11/23, 5:04 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/11/23, 5:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 5:10 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 5:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/11/23, 5:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
04/11/23, 5:15 pm - +27 81 046 0123: I'm with you
04/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
04/11/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/11/23, 5:25 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
04/11/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/11/23, 5:31 pm - +27 81 046 0123: How much is the visa fee and the plane ticket?
04/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27810460123 The Visa fees is around $85 and flight tickets depends on various factors although it approximately cost between $400-$500. Please don't worry we will share all the information regarding Visa and flight ticket at the right time.
04/11/23, 5:41 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Trying to work out the figures 🙈
04/11/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand and really appreciate your proactiveness. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
04/11/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
04/11/23, 5:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
04/11/23, 5:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 5:48 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Great
04/11/23, 5:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @27810460123 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
04/11/23, 5:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
04/11/23, 5:50 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Great
04/11/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @27810460123 . With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
04/11/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
04/11/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
04/11/23, 5:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
04/11/23, 5:56 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
04/11/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
04/11/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Masket, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his seat before the competition even begins. He will be the trailblazer among his peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
04/11/23, 6:07 pm - +27 71 069 8295: That's great
04/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/11/23, 6:36 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
04/11/23, 6:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @27810460123, However as our operational hours are concluded. we will now resume our session on Monday at 2:00pm. Please take a note of the timing and have a good day ahead.
04/11/23, 6:39 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Thank you Sir, have a blessed evening further, may you have a wonderful Sunday too
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket, Wishing you all a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
06/11/23, 12:35 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Greetings
06/11/23, 12:35 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon my kind Sir, we are ready to roll
06/11/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @27810460123, Let's start our session with the third benefit of Endowment Plan.
06/11/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 1:16 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes Sir
06/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 1:19 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
06/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 1:27 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Shed more light please
06/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27810460123, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
06/11/23, 1:46 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
06/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/11/23, 2:04 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
06/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 2:53 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
06/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27810460123 May I kindly know if you are experiencing any challenges as our session hasn't been going smoothly, please share your concern so that I can assist you in the best possible way.
06/11/23, 3:04 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Not much, my only challenge is my time management, I can hardly sit still, I have to attend to safety issues on site,
06/11/23, 3:06 pm - +27 81 046 0123: As for the sessions, I am fine, as soon as I get the opportunity to respond, i will do so immediately
06/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand that Being the Health Safety and environmental officer, requires higher attention at the work. In order to have effective sessions, I would like to schedule our session for 8pm today, Could you please share if you can attend the session?
06/11/23, 3:10 pm - +27 81 046 0123: I am comfortable,
06/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, let's reconnect at 8:00pm
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Until then, have a blessed afternoon
06/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @27810460123, wishing you the same.
06/11/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Masket, I hope you are having a good day!

In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Good evening
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session @27810460123 ?
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Getting ready
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 81 046 0123: He is writing in 2024,results in 2025
06/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Noted
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2025, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2026, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of his interest in August 2025 itself. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 8:33 pm - +27 81 046 0123: Yes Sir
06/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
06/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 8:34 pm - +27 81 046 0123: We have to work hard for a Degree program
06/11/23, 8:34 pm - +27 81 046 0123: All good
