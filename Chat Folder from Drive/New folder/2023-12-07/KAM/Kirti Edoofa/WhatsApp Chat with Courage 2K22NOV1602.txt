17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK l remember
17/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 039 9759: On the registration process on the University admission first process is to share the qualifications with the Universities and after that you will wait for the response if it is acceptable then one is axpected to pay $500 to $700
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK thank you for that 
I want to inform you that since my intake is in 2024 is there any problem if you share my qualifications with different universities in  2024 around May
17/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand since the academic month in India is August every year, sharing applications in the month of may be tricky since most of the seats will be filled and almost every student will be focusing on the visa applications because only 2 months will be left for their arrival, so being your admission officer, I would like to know that it is not a wise choice @263780399759, as there is a chance the university seats might already be taken.

I hope you understand?
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK thank you very much for good explanation on that now I'm aware and clear on that 👏
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you have understood well. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes absolutely ready
17/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes that's correct
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Noted
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Noted
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes . we have also discuss about it with my counsellor
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Duly noted
17/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
17/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
17/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 039 9759: So far so good
17/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 039 9759: That's very amazing to hear
17/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK we will be waiting for it
17/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes I'm done we can proceed
17/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Courage, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK l understand
17/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes it is
17/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Alright l understand
17/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK so if the registration fee is 500 Edoofa will also cover $150
17/10/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. However, for a safer side we always consider the registration fee as $750, so that even if the fee in less as parents you will be prepared with the $750 amount and that extra finance can be used further in the admission journey.
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK...so far so good
17/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 039 9759: You can explain on the admission process
17/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780399759 That is all for our discussion, I wanted to ask if you have any queries now with respect to how the admission process unfolds, as the admission process was explained to you earlier, with cost break down, if you want me to reiterate it, I can surely do that?
17/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK ,Alright it's so clear.   So is there any problem if we continue with our discussion tomorrow
17/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Absolutely not, however, the discussion is over @263780399759. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes I'm very excited about this and can't wait for the year 2024 to come
17/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see your enthusiasm. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Good evening to you admission officer l hope you are doing well
18/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Alright l will be waiting

4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK 

1   .$900 per semester after the scholarship 
2.  5 years course 
3. $300 
4.  $750
03/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
03/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Alright l understand
03/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
03/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Duly noted with us
03/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK so l will choose when l arrive in India
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 678 2200: ok
03/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
03/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK so the $200 per 2 semester is not part of fees
03/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes we are on the same page
03/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK so this $ 300 is part of the $750
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK thank you for thorough explanation..l understand
03/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 039 9759: No l live in Rusape but it's not away too much from Harare
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK thank you very much we will communicate with him
03/11/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 039 9759: In case you can send we will discuss where to go but 7% rate is reasonable
03/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited
03/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Okay
03/11/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
03/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Noted ✅
03/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
03/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
03/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
03/11/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes l understand
03/11/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!

04/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
04/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
04/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
04/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Yes it so good 

OK no problem
04/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK l have been share with them
04/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please have a great day and weekend ahead.
04/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 678 2200: I WOUID LIKE，TO THANK yOU  ALL EDOOFA TEAM FOR THE EFFORT YOU HAD MADE TO MY SON COURAGE FOR HIS HIGHER EDUCATION NOW ITS OUR TIME TO MAKE IT TRUE
04/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK and you too
04/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear your heartfelt gratitude, I really appreciate it. Now, as you step into this important phase of making his higher education dreams a reality, dedication, and efforts from all sides are necessary. It's a team effort, and your commitment as a family is just as vital. Have a blessed weekend Mr. Richard
04/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 678 2200: OK THANK YOU SO MUCH
06/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Courage.

I hope you are doing well. I hope you were able to go through the university insights by now and I am sure you must have questions to ask too, we can connect today at 08:00 pm, may I know if 08:00 pm today is suitable for you as well?
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can make progress and move ahead with the admission process?
06/11/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 2:04 am - +263 78 039 9759: Good morning to you admission officer..network was the challenge  yesterday
07/11/23, 5:32 am - +263 71 678 2200: Good afternoon to you all the Members of Edoofa  l hope you are doing good 

I want to inform you about  what we have been agreed and all steps that was taken 

At this moment things are fall apart and we were not expecting this before 
We were expecting to get our back payments this month as commercial farmers but unfortunately our government postponed the dates 

So at this moment we are stuck so is there any problem if you will do the same next year on around Mid April so that we will pay all the burden and l promise there will be no obstacles
07/11/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Courage.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with a meeting. Thank you for sharing that, I really appreciate you sharing with us transparently the challenges that you are going through. However, could you please help me understand the reason as to why the government postponed the dates for the payment?
07/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK we can understand...

As we were promised earlier after our sells in April  before the elections took place. The government promised to give those payments after the elections in the early November but unfortunately it's look like it went in shambles
07/11/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand that the economic situation in Zimbabwe can present difficulties, which is why parents seek educational opportunities abroad for their children. It's clear that, like many others, your parents are also committed to providing you with the best possible future, which is why they're considering an international education for you, with Edoofa you are getting international education as well as affordable education.
07/11/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, I would like to know what kind of commercial payment were you referring to and if you do not mind me asking, could you please let me know the amount of the payment you were expecting to receive which got postponed. This information can help me get better clarity?
07/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 039 9759: That's very true and we can't let this opportunity go
07/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
07/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Alright l think it was typing error it's commercial farmers 

When we sell tobacco to companies they give us money but later own the government gave these farmers money called back payments or it's like a token of apriciation of what we did and the money varies depending on the amount of tobacco one's sold 

We were expecting money around $700 to $750
07/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 039 9759: I replied here
07/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I understand your perspective Courage, and it's clear that you were planning to be fully prepared for your admission in August 2024. However, I would like to know what are your backup plans you have in mind for your higher education since you are preparing for a long time for your 2024 intake. Maybe you can help me with that?
07/11/23, 10:59 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK let me explain 
For the meantime or next few months we are working day and nights in the tobacco fields to raise money for this opportunity and l promise beyond reasonable doubt we will then pay all needed necessities
07/11/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that. As you mentioned above you wish to proceed ahead next year in April. That can certainly be possible, however, we can not assure you that you would have the same benefits that you have now. These international scholarships are highly competitive since students all over the world are applying, and seats are limited. Therefore, the earlier you initiate your admission process and secure your scholarship seat, the better your chances of success. The longer, you run the risk of missing out. This could also affect the additional financial benefits offered under the endowment plan, which may no longer be available.
07/11/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since the due date for your scholarship seat is November 16th and it has been six days, there's still an opportunity for us to discuss this with the university, ensuring you not only secure your high quantum scholarship but are also avail the endowment benefits. While you can still take admission later in the year, you might lose your scholarship and endowment benefits. I believe this isn't the outcome you as a family hope for?
08/11/23, 6:47 am - +263 78 039 9759: Oky we understand if they is  anything happening in the next few days left l will definitely inform you
08/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Courage.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. I am looking forward to our our discussion at 08:00 pm today so that we can move ahead and figure out a possible solution for your admission process.
08/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK l will be available
08/11/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

08/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now coming back to our discussion. Now that you are aware of the importance of the letter and the endowment benefits, may I know what you thought about your backup plan and how to wish to reserve your seat and even use the endowment benefits?
08/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 039 9759: At this moment l would like to inform you that my parents has managed to get registration and admission fee so we are going to pay it on the 14th of November
08/11/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Via cash $USD
08/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
08/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 039 9759: Alright l will actually ask
08/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
08/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
08/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK we will make sure that on 14th of this month we will definitely pay
08/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 039 9759: OK l will share it with you
08/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are making a really important choice for your career ahead. Also, I would like to inform you that we as a team will not be available from 10th- 13th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. <This message was edited>

May the festival of lights bring you joy, prosperity, and success. Looking forward to the day we can celebrate together. Until then, let the light of Diwali shine bright within your family.
