02/06/23, 10:51 am - You were added
02/08/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu.

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, please how have you and your family been?
02/08/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you were finally able to collect the documents and thank you for sharing the academic documents they are duly noted with us.
02/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 967 4664: We are doing good and thank you for asking.
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2023 intake?
02/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes that's true but it's August 2024 intake
02/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, allow me to correct. I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
02/08/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes it is
02/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
02/08/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes I am ready
02/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
02/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
02/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/08/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I agree
02/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
02/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
02/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
02/08/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 967 4664: my counsellor discussed the registration fee and even now all you are saying is clear
02/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
02/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 967 4664: understood
02/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
02/08/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 967 4664: it is clear
02/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I am following
02/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
02/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 967 4664: no I don't have queries, everything was in detail
02/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
02/08/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I will inform them definitely. 
It is ok , I don't have any problem , as you said tomorrow we will start with EWYL Program
02/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
02/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 967 4664: Thank you and same to you
02/08/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you!
03/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I am good , how about you ?

08/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 967 4664: that's great
yes I am available to connect with you
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
08/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 967 4664: not at all
08/09/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Mondliwethu, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
08/09/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 967 4664: thank you for clarifying. I understand
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 967 4664: indeed that's true
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 967 4664: you can go ahead
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
08/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 967 4664: no
08/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I wasn't aware
08/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
08/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 967 4664: it's clear
08/09/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
08/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 967 4664: it's clear
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great now moving ahead.

2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
08/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I am following
08/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.

3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 967 4664: understood
08/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
08/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 967 4664: no queries
08/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these points clear?
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 967 4664: all is clear and well detailed
we can go ahead
08/09/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm please make sure you and your parents both are actively available to connect.
08/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 967 4664: alright.. I will do so
08/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day till then.
08/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 967 4664: thank you and you too
09/09/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Mondliwethu.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

09/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 967 4664: the discussion was good and they understood what you were saying
09/09/23, 11:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
09/09/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 967 4664: they are available
09/09/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, could you please, ask them to connect with us?
09/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 263 3780: Morning hope you are well   thank you
09/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263772633780 greetings, I hope you are doing well, Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Before we move forward may I know what were your thoughts regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously, and If you have any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
09/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 263 3780: Thank you for being part of this conversation .yes was following each n every explanation you gave us all is well understood  yes early benefits are suitable for our child coz we are on the safe side of fees increament
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
09/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 967 4664: we are on the same page
09/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 263 3780: Yes we are on the same page lm following
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
09/09/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 967 4664: it's clear
09/09/23, 11:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
09/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 967 4664: yes
09/09/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 967 4664: that's clear
09/09/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
09/09/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
09/09/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 09th of September, the deadline becomes the 24th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 09th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 24th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 24th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
09/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes
09/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
09/09/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes it's clear
09/09/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
09/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 263 3780: Yes yo explanation is clear
09/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what the registration fee is, and the deadline dates in each approach so that we can be on the same page?
09/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 967 4664: the first part of the 300usd is to be paid within 15 days then the second part of the 300usd is to be paid within a month
09/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed for the early decision process you have explained it really well, may I know what is your understanding of the standard admission process?
09/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 967 4664: as per standard procedure, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of 750usd
09/09/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
09/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 967 4664: that's clear
11/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mondliwethu.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/09/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
14/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 967 4664: Good morning @917292063289
14/09/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation in the personal window, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 967 4664: I am available
14/09/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
14/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 967 4664: that was clear
14/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
14/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *24th September* and *24th October*.
14/09/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *24th September* and *24th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Mondliwethu's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 967 4664: let me ask something
14/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please Mondliwethu?
14/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 967 4664: so even if the offer letter comes on the 16th of September, still that 300usd is to be paid on the 24th of  September ??
14/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, As stated clearly above the registration amount would be paid after 15 days of getting the offer letter, so if you receive the offer letter on the 16th of September, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *01st October* and *01st November*. 

I hope you are clear now?
14/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes that's now clear. thank you
14/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if your parents are available as we would only move forward if they give us *go-ahead*
14/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 967 4664: they are available

14/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 263 3780: Yes you can go ahead thank you
14/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Mondliwethu's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *24th September* and *24th October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
14/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 263 3780: From my understanding you said we will be guided by the offer letter    when we get it ...is it not so
14/09/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263772633780 from the day you receive the offer letter you would be required to pay the first part of the registration fee within 15 days and the next part after a month. Now that depends upon the university how much time it will take to generate Mondliwethu's offer letter, please. So may I know if you are mentally prepared for the next steps as you have given us a Go-ahead?
14/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 263 3780: Ok noted thank you

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?

2. The Standard Duration of my course is 5 years

30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mondliweth!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
30/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 967 4664: yes that's clear
30/09/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
30/09/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
30/09/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
30/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 967 4664: can you clarify more about Off_ Campus Accomodation
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please what do you wish to know about the Off-Campus Accommodation please?
30/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 967 4664: like can you explain the last point of the Off campus accommodation
30/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 967 4664: so if I may ask .. is this the only university which accepted me ??
30/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 967 4664: as you said before that many universities will respond then I choose from which I see it as the best university for me
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding your queries, stay assured that I have taken a note of the same, and I will be answering them towards the end of our discussion, till then, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion here?
05/10/23, 7:55 am - +263 78 967 4664: Good morning everyone.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead with our discussion here, can you please let me know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
05/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes am clear
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 263 3780: Hw are you everyone
06/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 263 3780: Yes we are together
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
11/10/23, 11:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mondliweth!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
13/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 967 4664: yes we good
13/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
13/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
13/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 967 4664: ok I hear you
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the discussion that we had here earlier, I believe you were aware that the deadline to make the payment for Mondliwethu's registration fee was of 13th October 2023, hence, can you please share an update with me about the same that if you were able to make the payment by now?
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 967 4664: not yet .. Isn't I was supposed to receive another offer letter to choose or that was the final one ??
15/10/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
15/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 967 4664: oky so that means some rejected my application?
15/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, it is just that Galgotias is the first offer letter that you have received. Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 263 3780: That's clear . So what's the way forward ?
15/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 263 3780: No lm not aware
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/10/23, 11:20 pm - +263 78 967 4664: that's well detailed
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, since you are now clear about how the admission process is navigated, I believe you are ready to complete the admission process, right?
16/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 967 4664: yes
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the discussion that we had earlier, where you go the clarity on how the admission process is carried out, can you please help me in understanding more about by when is it that you are planning to make the payment of the registration fee please?
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we were having here earlier, I was expecting you to connect with me here so that we could have discussed the next steps in your admission journey.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you are aware that we are already past the due date for the payment of your registration fee in that case, the university officials are waiting for an update from our side, and about that, I want to share the same with them only after I have a discussion with you here. Hence, can you please let me know when would be the right time for us to connect and discuss the same?
21/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 967 4664: good afternoon

06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mondliwethu!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mondliwethu!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been quite some time since we were last able to connect with each other here, and I apologize for the delay in our communication. I got occupied with our students here in India for some campus activities, which led to this delay. I truly appreciate your patience during this time.

In order for us to continue our discussion and address any pending matters, I propose scheduling our next discussion for 03:30 PM tomorrow. I hope this time is suitable for you. Thank you for your understanding.
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mondliwethu!
