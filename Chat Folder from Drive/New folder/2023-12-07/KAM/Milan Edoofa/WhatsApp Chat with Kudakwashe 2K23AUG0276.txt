On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?

14/08/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Ohhh okay mam l think there is a misunderstanding!
I was just asking so that l get a clear understanding,not that l want to change right away. <This message was edited>
14/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright. Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
14/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we can continue
14/08/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes
14/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 084 7544: I am ready
14/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 084 7544: If you can explain to me in detail that will be helpful
14/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes well understood
14/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam you can go ahead
14/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So is the SOP in form of essays or?
14/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780847544 no, we shall be assisting you with your SOP also please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
14/08/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we can move ahead
14/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 084 7544: As per acceptance letter l read that the amount will be  adjusted in the first-year fee when l arrive in India, effectively making the registration fee $0 is that so?
14/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 084 7544: This is clear
14/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely true.
14/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Very well
14/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we can proceed
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 084 7544: I think by tomorrow
14/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since tomorrow is a National holiday here in India, we will not be able to connect with you tomorrow so can I anticipate you will be able to go through the videos by Wednesday at 01.00 pm?
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam Wednesday is fine
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect on Wednesday at 01.00 pm, have a great night.
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Same to you
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
16/08/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon  Parents and Kudakwashe.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our previous conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now? <This message was edited>
16/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Good afternoon mam
16/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l was able to go through the videos
16/08/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
16/08/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Well l have understood that Edoofa is not just scholarship program rather it is a community per say that helps one to achieve set goal through education
16/08/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Also that Edoofa is connected to a number of top schools and universities where students are enrolled at
16/08/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Also the SOP is an important statement as it plays a major role in university admissions
16/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam
16/08/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
16/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 084 7544: We can proceed
16/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
16/08/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

*1. O-Level Results*

16/08/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Good evening

16/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 084 7544: The BPM lifecycle is comprised of five phases that is process design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each phase of the lifecycle builds on the previous one, and the result is an efficient and effective business process management system that meets the needs of the business.

Design
The process design stage is the foundation of a successful BPM initiative and is all about understanding the current state of your business processes and developing an improvement plan. This begins with identifying the goals you want to achieve and determining which processes need to be redesigned to meet those goals.

Model
After you have analyzed your business processes in step one, it is time to start modeling them in step two.
The first thing you need to do when modeling your business processes is to identify the inputs and outputs of each process. Inputs are anything that goes into the process, such as raw materials or information. Outputs are anything that comes out of the process, such as finished products or services.
To map out the entire process and steps in detail, you will need to create a flowchart. A flowchart is a diagram that shows the steps in a process in sequential order.

Execute
Implementing the business process is the third stage in the business process management methodology. This is where you take all of the planning and theoretical work that’s been done and put it into action.
Before fully implementing the new process, testing it out on a small scale is essential to ensure that it works as intended. This will help identify potential problems and allow for adjustments before rolling it out company-wide.

Monitor
To effectively monitor your business processes, you need to establish a set of metrics and  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track. These will vary depending on the type of business and the specific processes you are trying to improve. However, some common examples include cycle time, customer satisfaction, error rates, and throughput.
You can identify potential bottlenecks or areas needing improvement by monitoring these metrics. Once identified, these areas can be optimized, which takes us to our final stage in the business process management lifecycle.

Optimize
The optimization stage is about continuously improving the business processes that have already been identified, documented, and analyzed. The goal at this stage is to continue making the business processes more effective and streamlined.
Process optimization is important because it can help businesses achieve their desired outcomes while also reducing costs. In today’s competitive business landscape, companies must continually strive to find ways to do more with less
16/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 084 7544: A business is very essential to the development of the economy.A business will contribute in the investment sector.If there is a business,investors will find interest in investing their resources in the business. When this happens the business grows and whilst the business grows it will cause the gross domestic product to rise. Rise in gross domestic product is the increase in the economy output therefore goods produced will be more.

A business also contributes in raising the employment rate. When a business commences there is need for labour therefore people in the nearby areas will be employed and this decreases unemployment rate in the economy.The people employed in the business will have high living standards.
High living standards will reduce level of poverty in the economy.
16/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 084 7544: One of Human Resources primary roles is managing payment and benefits for an organization's staff. Proper management of compensation, time off, and insurance is what keeps employee satisfaction high. As a human resource manager, you'll be in charge of distributing, communicating, and improving compensation and benefits packages.
Recruiting and hiring talent is also one of the most important HR functions, and it goes far beyond attending job fairs and going through resumes.
Human resource management helps improve the effectiveness of an organization. From improving company morale and developing methods to ensure high performance standards to resolving conflicts among employees and ensuring a company stays within its budget
16/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 084 7544: At my school l got an opportunity of getting into the jazz department. It deals with buying and selling stuff at the school. Well l got an opportunity of becoming the head of department for at least 2 months. And for the 2 months l have noticed that we did quite come up with a huge profit. As l was given the duty to show my skills l think they worked very well given that we made high profits during the time. Of course we having having profits before but the strategies which we carried out while l was the head made me realise the managerial skills l have
16/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form and the academic interview questions, may I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
16/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Let me share with you
16/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 084 7544: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 084 7544: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Business Administration, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam
16/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l am ready
16/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes it is not possible
16/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l am aware
16/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780847544 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
17/08/23, 6:55 am - +263 78 084 7544: Good morning mam.
Sorry for inconvenience caused last night.
17/08/23, 6:56 am - +263 78 084 7544: Yes very well understood

And l am aware that if l do well in the EWYL program l might even afford the $2000-$3000?
17/08/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/08/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l am available
17/08/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great and yes indeed that is true. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
17/08/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So l will be the one paying  $2800 per annum right?
17/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let, me help you explain further. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
17/08/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay l am following
17/08/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
17/08/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 084 7544: No l do not have any
17/08/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now Kudakwashe, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
17/08/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay thank you
17/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead and extend my regards to your family as well.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
28/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
28/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
28/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
28/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam if you can briefly explain one by one in detail
28/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
28/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his registration formalities, you will be presented with his Official Admission Letter with the help of which he will be able to apply for the student visa.
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kudakwashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his seat before the competition even begins. He will be the trailblazer among his peers, firmly positioning himself as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
28/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay this is well understood
28/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes it does mam
28/09/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
28/09/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 084 7544: This is quite helpful and understood
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 084 7544: No l do not have any questions…this is self explanatory
28/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 084 7544: If you can provide me with more information it would be really helpful since l do not know
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/09/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
28/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 084 7544: The endowment plan is wuite helpful
28/09/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. I would have loved to continue with our discussion ahead, however, it is past our available working hours, so let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm to continue with the discussion.
28/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Hello mam <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So l will be expecting the offer letter in the coming days?
28/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
28/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes
28/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear here?
28/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l am clear mam
28/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes
28/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l definitely agree
28/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Ohh well understood
28/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
28/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So l will be under Edoofa scholarship whilst doing a diploma?
28/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes you are absolutely right.
28/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay mam you may proceed
28/09/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings may I know if we are still connected?
29/09/23, 6:15 am - +263 78 084 7544: Good morning mam
29/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Afternoon Kudakwashe is still at schoo
29/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Greetings,l am now available

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 084 7544: Greeting mam

Yes l am available
30/09/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
30/09/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So far l am clear mam
30/09/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/09/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So approximately how many days are left for the offer letter to be sent?
30/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780847544 the university is able to generate the offer letter within a weeks time, however, it completely depends on the University that how much time they will take to generate the offer letter.
30/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay mam
04/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

04/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter now please?
05/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we can move on
05/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, were you able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
05/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l was able to go through the offer letter
05/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 084 7544: 1.$900
2.3 years
3.$300
4.$750
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
06/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes this is clear
06/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 084 7544: I am well sir

How are you?
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine too dear, thank you for asking. Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 084 7544: So you are saying that the $800 will include transportation and food?
06/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please. This $800 is the accommodation cost please. Now these accommodation costs also have the food costs factored in with that please. 

On that note, I would also like to mention that all the off-campus accommodation facilities are located within walking distance from the university campus therefore, no transportation costs. I hope this is clear?
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay this is clear
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we are together
06/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
06/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 084 7544: We can move forward since l am clear
06/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
06/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we may continue
06/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
06/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 18th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 18th November 2023.*
06/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *18th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we are on the same page
06/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Sir if l may ask

Is there a chan e of getting admissions from other universities?
09/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here, for now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter here?
09/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Greetings sir

Yes we can move on
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, regarding this query of yours, we would discuss that further during our discussion, will that be okay with you?
09/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay
It is okay with me
09/10/23, 6:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear till here please?
09/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes l am clear
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 084 7544: No l am residing in Gweru
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/10/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/10/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
11/10/23, 11:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!

13/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you wish to make the payment through Mr. Rajan only, then you can use his Mukuru account for the same as well. Shall I share the details for the same with you here?
13/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Good day sir
13/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes you can send the details

16/10/23, 7:03 am - +263 77 246 7187: I would like to inquire if this is the only option that we have?
16/10/23, 7:03 am - +263 77 246 7187: Are there no other 2 or 3 universities so that we might compare the quality of education provided as well as the tution fees
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here right?
16/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes we are clear

You can continue
17/10/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 084 7544: How are you doing sir?
17/10/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we will wait and hope for the best
17/10/23, 12:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 084 7544: No sir may you please explain
17/10/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/10/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
17/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay sir
This is clear
17/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Morning good people .l still remember someone in this group saying there is a room to decline the offer if one can't afford the fees . Another university will be sort for the individual . I stand to be corrected here
17/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 246 7187: I was also doing our budget and found out that accommodation and tuition are beyond our limits as a family . If Kudal can find a university which wle can afford
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is entirely correct. However, in that case, instead of declining the offer and losing on the scholarship seat, there is a better alternative for you to follow, and that is to secure the scholarship seat in time by paying the registration fee and then utilizing the transfer option to shift your admission to another university. I hope this is understood, right?
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier regarding the discussion that we were having so that we could have moved ahead with our conversation about your admission process. On that note, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same so that we can proceed?
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 902 5265: Good day, we're still making deliberations as a family on the way forward and we will surely come back to you Sir.
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, on that note don't you think it would be better to make sure that I am also aware of all the discussions that you are having so that I can also help you in making sure that your plans are being made in the right direction?
25/10/23, 4:15 am - +263 77 246 7187: Thank you we are all fine. Is it possible to reschedule the meeting to next week Tuesday since this week we are all committed to somewhere
25/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your response, and I understand that you have commitments this week. However, I would like to emphasize the importance of the scholarship offer from Galgotias University that you have already received. 

The offer letter from Galgotias University has a deadline date of 28th October. If we reschedule our meeting for next week Tuesday, you risk losing this scholarship opportunity and from there, Kudakwashe won't be able to get this scholarship offer again. I'm sure that you do not want that to happen, right?
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good evening my apologies am seeing this now since l was busy the whole daly
26/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we can move on sir
26/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Greetings to you
26/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good afternoon yes let's discuss
26/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 246 7187: We managed to discuss yes
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 246 7187: From our discussion we found out that we do not have enough resources . If we can have a university which we can afford
27/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to ask how much do you think you can afford per annum for Kudakwashe's higher education so that we can plan the admission process accordingly?
31/10/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to revert to me here in the group earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion further. May I know if you were able to go through this message of mine, so that we can discuss the same and plan the next steps about your admission process?
31/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good afternoon sorry for the silence. Here we work 24/7 .We were busy and Kuda is still tied up with exams . Our budget for him  is 2000 accommodation and tuition fees
01/11/23, 9:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 9:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the budget for Kudakwashe's accommodation and tuition fees. Considering the financial constraints, there are still possibilities to explore. There might be other universities offering suitable education within this budget. I'll be glad to assist you in finding potential options that align with your financial plan. Shall we move ahead to discuss about that please?
02/11/23, 7:37 am - +263 77 902 5265: Good morning Sir. We would also have preferred a situation whereby we are given a list of at least 5 or so institutions with their requirements so that we can go through and choose the one that suits us of course with your guidance, thank you.
02/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your suggestion for a list of institutions with their requirements. However, the admission process doesn't typically operate in a manner where choices are provided for selection, as this involves planning the student's academic future, aligning aspirations with suitable educational opportunities. Nevertheless, I understand your perspective.
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward, considering your financial constraints, I will explore other partner universities. I aim to find an opportunity for Kudakwashe to pursue higher education within the specified budget range. I believe this could provide a feasible solution. How do you feel about exploring this avenue for his education?
02/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 902 5265: Ok, good day, please go ahead and let us know the options that are available.
02/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 246 7187: In the same vain we don't want to disadvantage him by putting him in a university which does not offer quality education
If l may also ask where does earn while you learn come in
02/11/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your interest in exploring options. Rest assured, Edoofa collaborates exclusively with top-tier universities in India. The quality of education and the environment your son, Kudakwashe, will experience are of the highest standard. You can be confident that he'll receive an exceptional education at our partnered institution. I hope this is understood?
02/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Well understood
Earn while you learn has not yet been added
02/11/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, when it comes to EWYL Program, can you please clarify what exactly is it that you wish to clear about the same?
03/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 246 7187: It was mentioned earlier on that there is that facility that learners learn while they are given assignments to do which will make them earn some points which will be converted to their tuition
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:12 am - +263 77 246 7187: Noted
07/11/23, 5:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good evening
07/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes we may continue


Sorry l was having network problem
07/11/23, 8:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Now, moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding that how is it that you are planning to complete Kudakwashe's admission process?
07/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 246 7187: We want to know if there will be universities which can meet our budget
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please first help me in understanding how much is it that you can afford for Kudakwashe's admission?
07/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Around 2000 per anum
07/11/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, if we manage to get an opportunity for you where the total costs of Kudakwashe's higher education would be around $1300-1600 per annum, what would your reaction to that be?
07/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 246 7187: We would really appreciate and proceed with the admission
08/11/23, 7:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Let me move ahead to discuss the same with the academic board and move ahead to process Kudakwashe's application for the same.
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 902 5265: We will be looking forward to your feedback Sir.
13/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good morning group members
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you're doing well. 

From the discussion that we had here earlier regarding the completion of your admission process, I had a conversation with the academic board and in the conversation we discussed that since you can manage to raise $2000 per annum for your higher education here in India, in that case, we do have some partner universities here in India that offer scholarship opportunities with a higher quantum of scholarship where the costs of your higher education would come down to around $1200-1800 per annum, and these costs would include all teh university expenses. Now, would you be eager to discuss this opportunity here?
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 246 7187: $1200 -1800 is it inclusive of accommodation, food and tuition
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, it included all, tuition, food, and accommodation. What are your thoughts on that?
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 246 7187: As long as it offers good quality education
15/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, the universities we collaborate with maintain excellent academic standards. I can assure you that these partner universities are known for providing top-quality education, ensuring a holistic learning experience. I hope this is understood?
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Well understood
15/11/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, as you are aware that you can pursue your higher education here in India for the same costs, how do you wish to move ahead with that?
16/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 246 7187: If you can give us the names so that we can also find out how they are . Good morning everyone
17/11/23, 6:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Good evening l am available but network is on and off
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. How have you been doing for the past few days?
18/11/23, 4:24 am - +263 77 246 7187: It was business as usual
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes true it has been a long time how are you. Here everyone is good
23/11/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am doing very fine, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, shall we begin with our discussion here?
23/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes sir
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead since, you are aware that it has been quite some time since we have received your offer letter, may you please let me know if you have planned something with respect to your admission process as of now? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 084 7544: We are sill waiting for some offer letters as we will not be able to ,meet up with the requirements of the one which was sent to us
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask which requirements are you referring to here please?
23/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 084 7544: The tuition fee sir
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. On that note, can you please help me in understanding what is the challenge that you are facing in terms of the fee at Galgotias?
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for joining today's session. As my available hours are concluding, and it has been a long day, I'll be closing our session for now. Let's reconvene tomorrow starting from 01:00 PM to continue our discussion. Have a wonderful evening, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe! I hope this message finds you well.

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes sir
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier yesterday, you had mentioned that you are not able to meet up on the requirements as of now, and to be specific it was the tuition fee, right? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes please
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. Now, on that note, can you please let me know are you comfortable in paying just the registration fee as of now?
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 246 7187: As long as it's 2000 my parents can't afford
24/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kudakwashe, I am asking about the registration fee dear, not the tuition fee now?
24/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 246 7187: No until l find an affordable university
24/11/23, 6:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well. May you please come again and help me understand what is it that you wish to say dear.
24/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 246 7187: No
24/11/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask why is that please?
24/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 246 7187: We are still saving the money. What was saved previously has been used by Kudakwashe's on her school fees
24/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is understandable please. However, on that note, can you please let me know how are you planning to raise the fee now? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 246 7187: If we save December and  January it will be fine . This month we are paying for his passport
24/11/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, why is it that you wish to get his passport so soon, since he will be coming to India in 2024?
25/11/23, 1:25 am - +263 77 246 7187: Things here are not stable in case it may delay everything
25/11/23, 10:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
25/11/23, 10:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, may I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about the admission process?
25/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 246 7187: Yels please although network is giving us a challenge here
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, since you have mentioned that it may delay eveything, that is true. However, if you won't complete the admission process, then what would be the passport used for?

On that note, don't you think it is important and wise to complete the admission first and then come to things like Passport, etc.
25/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 246 7187: You are right unfortunately l have already paid the passport
25/11/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask, how much have you paid for Passport?
25/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 246 7187: 120
25/11/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, on that note, since you had taken an action without discussing it with anyone here, I believe that is why you could not complete the admission process in time. 

Moving ahead, since you are now planning to make the payment of the admission fee in December, in that case you won't be getting the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the $150 Grant, and hence, you would have to pay the whole $750 registration fee. I hope you understand?
25/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Our main reason for not paying was that the tuition at the University of Golgatia was just too high for our pocket and we suggested that if you could find another university which is a little bit cheaper but offering quality education
25/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 246 7187: This is what was said earlier on
28/11/23, 8:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to connect with you here for the past few days since I got occupied in something that require my urgent attention. I apologize for the delay. 

Now, I understand that the fee at Galgotias may seem to be very high for you, and I want to assure you that we are always looking for ways to make education affordable for our students. That's why we have shared your application with a few of our other partner universities as well, where the costs of education would comparatively be less than what it is at Galgotias. We are expecting a response from them soon, and we will let you know as soon as we have any updates. In the meantime, may I know if you are aware of how the admission process of a student is carried out?
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Morning Apology accepted.Yes we are aware of the admission process
28/11/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Can you please share with me here about your idea of how the admission process is carried out?
29/11/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your admission process. 

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here now so that we can transition to the next steps in the admission journey?

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been quite some time since we were last able to connect with each other here, and I apologize for the delay in our communication. I got occupied with our students here in India for some campus activities, which led to this delay. I truly appreciate your patience during this time.

In order for us to continue our discussion and address any pending matters, I propose scheduling our next discussion for 03:30 PM tomorrow. I hope this time is suitable for you. Thank you for your understanding.
05/12/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Well noted
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe!

06/12/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine as well please. Thank you for asking. Now, earlier we had a discussion with each other regarding Kudakwashe's admission process, do you recall?
06/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes
06/12/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier, you had mentioned that the costs at Galgotias University seem a bit too much for you right?
06/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 246 7187: True
06/12/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, how is it that you are now planning to move ahead with Kudakwashe's higher education?
06/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 246 7187: If we can find another university which we can afford
06/12/23, 4:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: About that, may you please let me know how much is it that you can afford for Kudakwashe's higher education? <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 246 7187: This is what we suggested previously
06/12/23, 5:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if you are comfortable in raising that much amount, I would like to mention that there are certain partner universities of Edoofa where the cost of education is comparatively low since they offer a higher quantum of scholarship. May I know if we shall discuss about that?
06/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes please
06/12/23, 5:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, let us say that the cost of education for Kudakwashe comes down to $1200-1500 per annum. In that case, you would be comfortable in raising the same, right?
06/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Yes
06/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Provided food and accommodation are included
