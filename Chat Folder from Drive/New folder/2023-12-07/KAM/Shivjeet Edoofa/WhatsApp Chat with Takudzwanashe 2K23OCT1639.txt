07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
07/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 817 5746: I agree Sir.
07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 2:00 PM.
07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

07/11/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright.

08/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 817 5746: 3) The relationship between humans and the environment is that humans use resources they extract from the environment like water, minerals and food from the environment. Also the interact through pollution whereby they introduce harmful substances into the environment like carbon dioxide and plastic waste .
Humans also interact with the environment through agricultural activities, landuse where we build structures,farms and other development activities .
Also they interact through energy production where humans generate energy from fossil fuels when when released they contribute to climate change.
However also developing renewable energy sources like solar and wind power by the environment which is an advantage to the humans.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Urbanisation also is an interaction between humans and the environment because as the population grows,more people in the cities will lead to problems like air pollution and increased water use.however cities also provide benefits like improved sanitation and access to healthcare.
Transportation is another way humans interact with the environment through use of cars and planes which also increase green house gases and other pollutants but also make it possible to travel and transport goods quickly.Also things like tourism and recreation have an impact on the environment because tourists can litter and Degrade the environment.
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 817 5746: 4) Places are connected to each other through transportation and communication which allow the movement of foods, people and information between different places.

08/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for the day now. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and wi be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the *"Festival of Lights."* It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

15/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Good evening sir , yesterday my phone was off due to power outages but we can proceed with today's session if necessary.
16/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course! Here's a response you might consider:

Good evening,

Thank you for getting back to me, and I hope the power situation has improved for you. It's understandable; power outages can indeed disrupt communication. If you're ready to proceed with today's session, that would be excellent.
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Good day to you Sir
20/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 817 5746: We can proceed
20/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you were not able to submit this said document, I would like to let you know that your EWYL session has again been postponed to the 24th of November. So, may I know by when you might be able to fill out the form with the correct date, which is the 24th of November?
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 817 5746: By tomorrow
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session?
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes we may proceed
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Correct
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
20/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes,I'm ready
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes ,so do you then choose the best out of them all
20/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct and we will help you choose the best out of them. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Okay duly noted sir ,so when paying this registration fee will  there be any other charges included.
20/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee, and there would be transfer charges, similar to the enrollment fees. We will discuss more about this in our future session soon.
20/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes it was discussed
20/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes we're on the same page
20/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today.

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 5:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Thank you sir 😊
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 817 5746: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Sorry sir my network is very bad.
21/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Ready Sir
21/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
21/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
21/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
21/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes taken note of
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
21/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Okay so the adjustment will only cover my first year's fee only and after that l will be paying $2800 as per the example above.
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Admission process and higher education costs are $2800 per annum am l correct?
21/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today.

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from Evening onwards and continue with this session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

04/12/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
04/12/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 817 5746: I am done with the benefits
04/12/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. I wasn't able to connect with you yesterday due to some technical challenges. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Good evening sir we may proceed
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Interesting point 😊.
05/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Well understood
05/12/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/12/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Yes sir it does resonate, proceed please
05/12/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to have our session productively today. However, thank you for being available. I really appreciate you being online with me. As my available hours are coming to an end and it was a long day for me, let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/12/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
06/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 817 5746: Thank you sir and warm greetings to you too.
