05/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking.
05/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 249 4868: You may proceed they are clear
05/12/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/12/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 249 4868: Yes I'm following
05/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/12/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 249 4868: Yes they are clear
06/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
