14/10/23, 9:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
14/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 584 7613: It's accurate

14/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 584 7613: Okay thank you
14/10/23, 9:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
14/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
14/10/23, 9:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
14/10/23, 9:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes l don't remember that much but l can recall a few things
14/10/23, 9:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
14/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes we can proceed
14/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 584 7613: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 584 7613: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 584 7613: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
14/10/23, 10:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
14/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes we are very clear
14/10/23, 10:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
14/10/23, 10:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
14/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 584 7613: Okay that's great
14/10/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
14/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 584 7613: No l don't have any questions everything is clear
14/10/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
14/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 584 7613: We will be very happy to receive the letter and we will be eagerly waiting for it
14/10/23, 10:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/10/23, 10:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/10/23, 10:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
14/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 584 7613: That's great that's why I'm a proud Edoofian
14/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
14/10/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
14/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 584 7613: Oaky
14/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 584 7613: This is good
14/10/23, 11:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 11:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 11:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 584 7613: That's great
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
14/10/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is the weekend and we have limited time during the weekend, I will be closing our session for now. Let us connect on Monday from 3:00 onwards to further proceed with our session. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
14/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay Thank you very much
16/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 584 7613: It's very understandable
16/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
16/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes I'm following
16/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 584 7613: So the is the grant applicable to everyone?
16/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The grant is applicable only to the students of Edoofa. May I know if you are clear?
16/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 584 7613: I would like clarity
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay that's great
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Understandable
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Sorry for responding late it's currently raining so I'm facing network challenges as the network is tripping
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright,  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Ok
16/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/10/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 584 7613: No questions everything is crystal clear

14/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 584 7613: 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Beauty,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay l went through it thoroughly
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes the approach is understandable
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 584 7613: 1 .$1165
2. 3
3. $ 750
4. $750
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, her annual tuition fee amounts to $1165, and the annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2415. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If ones plans to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2165 ($1165 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
15/11/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with Yemurai's annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
15/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 584 7613: This is great and affordable
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $2165, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 584 7613: That's great
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Noted
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you together for the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Yemurai with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2165. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2165 - $1000 = $1165, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how Yemurai can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Wow 👌 this is great
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 584 7613: She is indeed a hardworking and dedicated person
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 584 7613: No queries yet everything is clear so far
15/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
15/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I will be closing our session for now due to unexpected work that just came up.

So please do excuse me for that and, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay thank you very much for the lovely session
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Beauty !

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay I'm ready
16/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: am happy to hear that. Now continuation to  my above message. 

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1165 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2415. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665. This amount can be paid in two installments of $832 and $832, spaced 6 months apart.
16/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
16/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 28th, 2023.
16/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Okay thank you
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 584 7613: Yes
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
16/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 584 7613: I have received them
16/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
16/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
