22/11/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Evening sir
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 448 6799: We may start
22/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 733 5006: Good evening sir we can proceed
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Yes , they are clear
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Indeed I am following
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Understood sir
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Indeed we may proceed
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Let's move forward
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Goodnight to you too
23/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

24/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 448 6799: I do not think I'll be able to proceed as my internet connection is very low
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Good afternoon to you sir
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 448 6799: I am now available for the session
25/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the videos?
25/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Yes I was
25/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: The first one is about eligibility whereby an Edoofian is supposed to follow Edoofa ways , be teachable
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Also one has to be open minded
25/11/23, 1:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, please carry on!
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 448 6799: From the second video , the first issue which was discussed is about reliability taking from the story mentioned about the Chinese scholarship, Edoofa is always giving feedbacks so that one will be able to trace the progress
25/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Also students are taught to be responsible and independent that they may work out something on their own without troubling parents leading to maturation of their minds
25/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 448 6799: There is also emphasis on the issue of following rules
25/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please carry on with the last video, please
25/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 448 6799: On SOP , I'll be using the achievements I have whereas the board will be giving recommendations to the schools. For my achievements, I'll be using my certificates . The SOP is said to be my only subjective document giving me a unique advantage on the course
27/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 448 6799: Very well I thank you. How are you today?
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 448 6799: I do agree and I got to understand better including some points I missed out .
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 2) Zimbabwe lately has been developing better as compared to previous years and all thanks to the president by the implementation of NDS1. Indeed people still face challenges in the road to success .There are many ways that a geographer could contribute to Zimbabwe's development.One way would be to conduct research on the country's natural resources, including minerals, water, and arable land. This research could help inform policies around the sustainable use of these resources. A geographer could also work to improve the country's infrastructure, like roads and railways, which would help connect people and increase economic activity. Additionally, I could use my skills to help plan and develop cities and towns in a way that promotes sustainable growth. I could also help with disaster preparedness and response in Zimbabwe. I can use their knowledge of geography and data analysis to help predict and prepare for natural disasters like floods and droughts. They can also help with the relief and recovery efforts after a disaster has occurred. Additionally I could help develop strategies to address the issue of urban poverty in Zimbabwe. This could involve studying the spatial distribution of poverty and identifying areas that are most in need of assistance. So, there are many ways a geographer could help Zimbabwe!
 I could definitely help with issues of trade and environmental impact assessments (EIAs) in Zimbabwe. On the trade front, I can use their expertise to study the country's trade patterns and identify opportunities for increasing trade and economic development. They can also help to identify any barriers to trade and recommend ways to overcome them. In terms of EIAs, I can help to assess the environmental impacts of development projects, like mining or agricultural projects, and recommend ways to mitigate any negative impacts. All in all, as a geographer I have a lot to offer when it comes to issues of trade and the spatial distribution of benefits and costs.I can help to study how the benefits and costs of trade are distributed across different areas, and can recommend ways to ensure that all regions of the country benefit from trade. This is particularly important in a country like Zimbabwe, which has a high level of regional inequality. In partnership with other geographers, we can also study how trade can be used to promote regional development and reduce poverty.
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 3)The relationship between humans and the environment is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, humans depend on the environment for basic needs like food, water, and shelter. On the other hand, human activities like agriculture, industry, and urbanization can have significant impacts on the environment. So, it's a two-way relationship, with humans both relying on the environment and affecting it in turn. It's important for humans to understand and respect the environment, in order to ensure a sustainable future for both people and the planet. The human-environment relationship involves many different aspects, from environmental ethics to sustainability. One important issue is the impact of human activities on the environment. Activities like deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have negative effects on the environment, and can lead to the loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction. On the other hand, humans have also made positive contributions to the environment, such as through environmental conservation and restoration efforts. So, it's a complex and dynamic relationship, with both positive and negative effects. . Sustainable development is about finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. It's about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This can involve things like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and the circular economy. The idea is to create a system that's not just focused on short-term gains, but that also takes the long-term health of the planet into account.
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 4From a geographical perspective, places are connected in many ways. Firstly, there are physical connections, like the natural features that connect one place to another, like rivers and mountain ranges. There are also cultural connections, like the exchange of ideas, goods, and people between different places. And there are also economic connections, like trade and investment. And finally, there are political connections, like international agreements and treaties. These connections make it so that what happens in one place can have a ripple effect that reaches other places far away. Let's start with economic connections. One example is trade, where countries exchange goods and services with each other. This has a big impact on local economies and even the global economy. Another economic connection is investment, where businesses and governments invest in other countries, creating jobs and opportunities. Another example is tourism, where people visit different places and bring in revenue to the local economy. These economic connections can be very positive, but they can also have negative effects, like environmental damage and economic inequality.One example is international organizations like the United Nations or the World Trade Organization. These organizations bring together countries to solve problems and create policies. They also help to keep the peace and promote human rights. Another example is international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, there are also things like military alliances, which connect countries for security reasons. One interesting example is the concept of nation-states. A nation-state is a country that's made up of a single nation, or group of people who share the same culture and history. These countries can be very strong and influential, like the United States or China. Nation-states can have a big impact on other countries, through things like diplomacy, military force, or cultural influence. Another interesting political concept is the idea of globalization, where countries become more connected and interdependent.  Interdependence is the idea that countries are linked together, and that they can't function without each other. For example, many countries depend on each other for natural resources, like oil or food. Many also depend on each other for things like trade and investment. There are also cultural interdependencies, like the spread of popular culture around the world. This idea of interdependence means that countries can be very affected by what happens in other countries, like when there's a global recession or a pandemic.
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 448 6799: 5)GIS stands for "geographic information system." It's a technology that's used to capture, store, analyze, and display geographic data. This data can be things like population density, elevation, or climate. GIS is important because it allows us to visualize and understand data in a way that's not possible with traditional methods. For example, we can use GIS to map the spread of a disease, or to see how climate change is affecting a certain area. GIS has become an essential tool for governments, businesses, and researchers to make better decisions and solve problems.One important use of GIS is in emergency management. During natural disasters like hurricanes or wildfires, GIS can be used to track the event and coordinate relief efforts. For example, GIS can be used to create evacuation plans, or to see where resources are needed most. Another important use of GIS is in urban planning. GIS can be used to create models of urban areas, and to test different scenarios, like traffic patterns or the location of new housing developments. This helps cities make better decisions about how to use their resources and plan for growth. Another important use of GIS is in agriculture. Farmers and agricultural organizations can use GIS to make decisions about things like where to plant crops, how to manage irrigation, and how to monitor crop health. GIS can also be used to track things like soil conditions, weather patterns, and pests. Another use of GIS is in public health. GIS can be used to track disease outbreaks, identify risk factors, and plan public health interventions.
