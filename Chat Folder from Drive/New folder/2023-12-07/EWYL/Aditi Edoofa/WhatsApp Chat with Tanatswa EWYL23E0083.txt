16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning
We will take the second option <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.?
16/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 902 9727: Yes
16/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 288 6038: Well she will take the second option.
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
Have a good day.
25/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I apologize for being unable to take your Saturday session because the organization was closed. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.

I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning, we are having connectivity issues
30/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I will face a lot of challenges with consistency throughout the session 
My sincere apologies

30/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 902 9727: I am also very excited to get in touch again but as my parents and I have mentioned earlier, we had put the EWYL program on hold because of school and we informed the EDOOFA family via email
30/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I haven't started the ewyl projects
30/09/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I get it. I was of the notion it was Tanatswa's phone number.
30/09/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tanatswa* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

30/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Can you share what you've retained till now from your EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
30/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Yesterday you shared this document with me and asked that I go through it and give a brief of the document, so in essence I understood that the document outlines the activities for the EWYL program as well as the skills attained and the scholarship   credits received for each completed task
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Noted

30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The audio explains the document to be specific Cooperate Alliance
The Edoofian is expected to identify technologically driven companies in their region and share and market  Edoofas vision
The Edoofian also has to create a linked in account and get in touch with managers and shareholders and set up a meeting for the company of choice and Edoofa
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

30/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The document is a guide for searching for companies that would best suit the ideal companies Edoofa wants to target, nature, scale and founding details come into play
The document also gives examples of such ideal student centric companies 
Furthermore the document explains ways to get in touch with such companies be through their social media or company apps
30/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Before we continue I have a question
30/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The document mentions different companies from different countries but the earlier document had said the companies which we are to get in tough with have to be local
So to make the task clearer is it possible that you give examples of companies that meet your required criteria that are Zimbabwean <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic! <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 902 9727: What happens to the scholarship credits from this now canceled project?

1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

01/12/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.

01/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Noted
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TANATSWA/ADITI*
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
01/12/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

01/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
01/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

05/12/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Basically Tanatswa, we are not partnered with your school but we are associated and connected with the schools.

05/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Ok noted

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
05/12/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.
05/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Ok
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Ok
05/12/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

06/12/23, 1:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!🌻
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
06/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Yes, i am ready for the session
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 902 9727: But before we begin, I just have a few questions concerning the scholarship
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may ask.
06/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The main aim of the EWYL initiative is to earn scholarship credits that will cover atleast a third of tuition as initially promised whilst recruiting edoofians 
I am expected to then tell them what edoofa offers but yet I haven't received any of the benefits that I will have to speak on

Additionally I understand that the EWYL is to get scholarship credits but I haven't been placed into a university yet, so where are these scholarship credits going towards 

Lastly after reviewing the EWYL document, the amounts earned through the activities seem rather insignificant compared to thousands of dollars of fees, for example the first activity might get you 30 dollars at most and in comparison to roughly 8000 dollars a year the amounts are incomparable. Not anywhere close to the two thirds of tuition fees you had earlier said we would get  for a university I unfortunately haven't been placed <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns and appreciate your transparency. It's indeed crucial to have clarity on the benefits of the EWYL initiative. Regarding the scholarship, while the aim is to cover a portion of tuition fees, I acknowledge that you haven't received these benefits yet, and I understand the frustration but you have been on hold that's why you missed out on a lot of updates The placement process is ongoing, and you will be soon placed into a university. <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Even if I had started earlier 
Considering the placement process has been ongoing since April, I would still be getting rather insignificant amounts and also marketing a scholarship program I haven't received tangible benefits from
06/12/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Tanatswa, you would have received benefits if you had actively participated, but unfortunately, you haven't earned any scholarship credits, amounting to $0.
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 902 9727: If I am getting you correctly
Me being occupied with school and exams slowed down the university placement and the other promised offers? <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, because you were unavailable for sessions.
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 902 9727: I see
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, so may I know if you are ready to continue?
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 902 9727: We can
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
06/12/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
06/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Yes
06/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
06/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Noted
06/12/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up our session, we will continue from tomorrow.
