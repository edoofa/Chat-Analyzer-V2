16/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 239 0550: I’m the father of Shingirai
16/10/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to meet you, sir! I'm Ms. Aditi, and I'm here as Shingirai's mentor. I'm wholeheartedly dedicated to helping him along the way and making sure he achieves his goals. I'm thrilled to see your active participation and sincere interest in his career growth.
16/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 239 0550: We sacrificed for this journey to start and  we really appreciates your involvement in Shingirai’s growth agenda. This converges with our family dream. Thank you ma’am.
16/10/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your dedication and sacrifices for Shingirai's growth journey are truly commendable. It's heartening to hear that my involvement aligns with your family's dreams and aspirations. I'm here to support and guide Shingirai to the best of my abilities, and I appreciate your kind words.
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic long-term goal to aim for success in both sports and academics. Sure the EWYL program will be be a valuable resource in terms of providing additional financial support for your academic endeavors.
16/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Yes I also agree with you
16/10/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 290 1534: I don’t know the 2 key objectives
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Okay noted Ms
16/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
16/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Okay understood
16/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

16/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Thank you miss
16/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will have our session from *5:30 PM to 6:30 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 5:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
16/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 239 0550: Thank you very much for your support

18/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Yes it is something big and great to be mentioned by the owner

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 290 1534: It sounds warming and great Ms
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 290 1534: Im ready
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

18/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And what about the first answer?
18/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 290 1534: I don’t get your question
19/10/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings! ☀️
May your day be filled with positivity, productivity, and moments of joy.
Are you ready for today's session?
19/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 290 1534: Sorry miss I’m busy rn ..I’m at school finishing my checking in

19/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 290 1534: I have cricket practice that time too
19/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 239 0550: I thought you had indicated 12:00hrs to 1:00pm to accommodate his cricket practicing sessions.
19/10/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: I understand that there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the rescheduled session timings. I was under the impression that we had agreed upon a time slot from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM to ensure that it wouldn't clash with his cricket practice sessions.
19/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 239 0550: There is no misunderstanding madam only that there was a challenge of getting C form to complete the registration process. I shared this with the relevant authorities. He got the C form yesterday evening and today is completing the registration for him to start lessons. 
Maybe if he gets the LPU lessons timetable the program will be well aligned.
19/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. I understand that the delay was due to the challenge of obtaining the C form for registration, and you've already taken the necessary steps by sharing this with the relevant authorities. I appreciate your prompt action in resolving this issue.
We'll ensure that everything falls into place smoothly for his education and cricket practice.
Your communication is greatly appreciated, and I look forward to a successful coordination of his schedule.
20/10/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday!

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️
