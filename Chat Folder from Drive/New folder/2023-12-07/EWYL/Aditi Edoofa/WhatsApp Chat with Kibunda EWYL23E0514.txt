19/08/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
19/08/23, 8:58 am - +260 96 9739802: Yes Ms Aditi

22/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @260974599522!
I hope you are doing well.
I am *Ms. Aditi*, and I extend a warm welcome to the new member who has joined the group for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
22/08/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 4599522: Greetings. My name is Maureen Sompa-Kabuta. I am the aunty to Kibunda. I have been sponsoring her secondary school education. I am so grateful for this opportunity and am happy to start this journey with her.
22/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Maureen Sompa-Kabuta,

Thank you for reaching out and introducing yourself. It's wonderful to hear that you're Kibunda's aunt and have been supporting her secondary school education. Your commitment to her education is truly admirable, and I'm sure she deeply appreciates your support. This journey you're embarking on together is a meaningful one, and I wish both you and Kibunda all the best as you continue to support her education.
22/08/23, 9:56 am - +260 96 9739802: Indeed she is an amazing person
22/08/23, 9:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: I agree.
22/08/23, 9:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your allotted time slot.
I am happy we have come this forward and I am extremely thrilled to take this journey ahead with you.
22/08/23, 9:58 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok Ms Aditi
23/08/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
23/08/23, 8:35 am - +260 96 9739802: Morning, iam ready
23/08/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Kibunda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/08/23, 8:48 am - +260 96 9739802: My goal is to  help people and also help stabilize my countries economy hence the EWYL will help me learn to manage small amount of money for that reason I will be able to handle bigger money at a national level
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: I agree with you on this.
23/08/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 9:00 am - +260 96 9739802: No
23/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 9:06 am - +260 96 9739802: Okay
23/08/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:13 am - +260 96 9739802: I have read it
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure you must be motivated after reading this.
23/08/23, 9:14 am - +260 96 9739802: Yes I am
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
23/08/23, 9:16 am - +260 96 9739802: Is she the only one
23/08/23, 9:16 am - +260 96 9739802: On the team
23/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - +260 96 9739802: Looking forward to interacting with them
23/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Currently, they are busy with meetings but surely you'll get a chance to interact with them.
23/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/08/23, 9:21 am - +260 96 9739802: Very much
23/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>

24/08/23, 9:27 am - +260 96 9739802: Okay
24/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 9:30 am - +260 96 9739802: A take on accountability
24/08/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that is nice.
24/08/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/08/23, 9:33 am - +260 96 9739802: I did notice it
24/08/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
24/08/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
24/08/23, 9:34 am - +260 96 9739802: Wonderful day to you to

14/09/23, 8:35 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok
14/09/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/09/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kibunda, I am waiting for your response on this, so I hope everything is okay till now?
14/09/23, 9:07 am - +260 96 9739802: Yes
14/09/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay
14/09/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/09/23, 9:08 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok
14/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*KIBUNDA/ADITI/14SEPT23*
14/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
14/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Is it clear?
14/09/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: @260969739802 I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
14/09/23, 9:31 am - +260 96 9739802: Noted
14/09/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's it from my side.
Let's meet tomorrow at the same time for our session and be pro-active in our sessions.
Till then have a good day.
14/09/23, 9:36 am - +260 96 9739802: 🥰
14/09/23, 9:49 am - +260 96 9739802: MS Aditi , I am finding it so difficult with this especially that iam looking for scholarships then I start looking for people to join even when they are so many platforms to to do that . like Facebook , please elaborate on this one I need to understand
14/09/23, 9:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kibunda, I understand your frustration, and I'd be happy to elaborate on this topic for you.
May I know why you are looking for scholarships, Edoofa is already providing you with it and about looking for people to join you can surely connect with them on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram and Kibunda 80% of your doubts would be resolved itself if you are actively participating in your sessions.
14/09/23, 10:02 am - +260 96 9739802: ❤️
15/09/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday!

15/09/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kibunda, you have to share it with the students you would be reaching out.
I hope it's clear.
15/09/23, 8:35 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok noted thanks
15/09/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
15/09/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
15/09/23, 8:41 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok

15/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
15/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉 <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of more than 3000 students from different countries📍
15/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
15/09/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope everything is clear till now, Kibunda?
15/09/23, 8:54 am - +260 96 9739802: Yes
15/09/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
15/09/23, 8:58 am - +260 96 9739802: I will be doing that
15/09/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

21/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - +260 96 9739802: I left my phone number with the head teacher he said he will contact me ,iam just waiting
21/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
21/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

21/09/23, 9:04 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok
21/09/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

26/09/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 8:57 am - +260 96 9739802: Noted
26/09/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

26/09/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
26/09/23, 9:03 am - +260 96 9739802: Ok

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me.
26/09/23, 9:37 am - +260 96 9739802: Noted
26/09/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
