Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Very interesting

30/11/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
30/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 1:40 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Let me do that

30/11/23, 1:50 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Done Thanks
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Second section
Questions for you
30/11/23, 1:54 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It gives an insight of how  I should perceive life and challenges as an individual as well as a student.
It motivates and inspires one to keep up making great effort towards there goals even if it may seem hard

30/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: That every step taken is important in ones growth and towards reaching a certain goal
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It also gives the importance of cerebrating your wins and progress even if they're minimal.
One should always cerebrate their achievements as that can also help in building confidence of satisfying and accomplishing the main goal .
30/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: The first section is also a good one as it simply explains the value of helping each other as individuals.
That as people we should be willing to help those in need with what we have and in whichever way we can.
30/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: A candle does not lose its light by lighting another candle.
30/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, I absolutely loved your thoughts🚀🫶🏻
30/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am impressed to a level infinity👏🏼🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

How does that sound, Witness?

I can't wait to gain the skills I need.
And learn from the best while earning

4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions

06/12/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Witness, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Witness!

06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: The project will require me to find students who have just finished their secondary school education or are in their final year and Inform them about Edoofa so that if interested they also enrol into the program
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Witness, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
