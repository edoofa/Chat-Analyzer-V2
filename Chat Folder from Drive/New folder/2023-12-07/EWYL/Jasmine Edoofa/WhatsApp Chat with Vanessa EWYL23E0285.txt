10/08/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *UPDATE* - Session timing is 1:30 pm.
10/08/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So Vanessa, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨
10/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Alright, actually l don't have instagram username and Facebook username
10/08/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I would suggest you make an account on them. Can you share your photograph now?
10/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Alright
10/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 412 0599: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Please note a few things:
FIRST- From now onwards, you will have sessions on 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
10/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Alright
10/08/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
10/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Ok ok noted
10/08/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
10/08/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
10/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Alright
10/08/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
10/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Ok ok
10/08/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
10/08/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
10/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 412 0599: Okay miss Jasmine
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So now you can drop a message on the Line and I will get back to you.
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up our today's session. 
It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead ☺️
10/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 412 0599: You too miss Jasmine have a great day
11/08/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon
As we head into the weekend, *I encourage you to take this time to relax and rejuvenate, preparing yourself for the week ahead.* We will reconvene on _*Monday at 01:30 pm*_ for our session. Your dedication and participation are valued, and I look forward to our continued work together.

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

I hope you are doing well. IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organized. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

09/10/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon Vanessa!_* I hope you had a wonderful weekend. 🌞✨

Have you ever heard about the incredible feat of _Felix Baumgartner_, who jumped from the edge of space and landed safely in New Mexico? It's a remarkable testament to human courage and the thirst for exploration. Let's channel that spirit into our week ahead and reach for the stars in our own way! 🚀🌠
*So, are you ready for the session?*
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263714120599 
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
16/10/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Vanessa and Parents* @263714120599 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263714120599*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Vanessa*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Vanessa* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*

09/11/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity.
