27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Yes
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Lynette. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $300 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $0. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Yes
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Okay
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 396 8555: About expected enrollment what to do you mean
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Are you aware of Community Building?
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Yes
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, whenever one of your students pays the enrollment credits. You get credits. 

Are you aware of this?
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Yes
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, this is written in the table. The target for December is more than 4-5 enrollments
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Okay
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 396 8555: noted
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
27/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 396 8555: Noted thank you
