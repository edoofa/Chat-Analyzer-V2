Thank you for reaching out and providing an update on your schedule. I appreciate your proactive communication.
21/08/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thankyou very much. I really appreciate your kind words.

15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Greetings @918982519022 
I hope you are doing well
15/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you for understanding
15/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I've decided to consult my parents first before I make a decision as well
15/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I'll get back to you as soon as I can
16/09/23, 7:41 am - +263 77 698 9967: Good morning @918982519022
16/09/23, 7:42 am - +263 77 698 9967: So I've decided to attend the sessions myself on the time frame you stated
17/09/23, 11:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
17/09/23, 11:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Could you please let me know your time frame?
17/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 698 9967: My time frame is Saturday 0830 -0930
23/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Good evening @918982519022 today the cell service was down on the time frame I stated it got back to normal around 1300hrs and any inconveniences is sincerely regretted 
I hope everything is well
10/10/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon,*_ 
How are you doing? It's time for the session. 
Are you ready?
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Good afternoon ma'am
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I was in a lesson
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Im ready for it
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Nice to meet you Ms Jasmine
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Woow
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I think I do
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Prosper is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
10/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I understand now
10/10/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
10/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I understand I remember Mr Shubham Madhwal told me about this during our sessions
10/10/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I will tell you more about this in the near future. Now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I understand
10/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Very well then
Noted.
10/10/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Promise to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
10/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Oh okay
So is there a specific time frame for connecting with you
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Okay give me five minutes
10/10/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Im done reading it now
10/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Promise’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
10/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 698 9967: That's Great!
10/10/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 698 9967: It is not a problem at all
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Promise can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I understand
10/10/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.
10/10/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if is Promise available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
10/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Well it depends on the time frame stated .... starting from next week I'll be starting my final exams so I'll have to notify you if anything is ongoing on the time and day you state
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So I am sharing a contact of the EWYL LINE below. Kindly save that number and come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Okay
10/10/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, would you like to consider temporarily pausing your sessions until your exams are over?
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I would actually considering this as I am going to be done with them by 10 November
10/10/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Have you messaged on the EWYL LINE Promise?

I trust you all are doing well. I know your child is currently focused on school and exams, and you've formally paused the sessions. However, I want to ensure that Promise stays connected with the community's progress, and that's why _*I'm willing to share the newsletter from the past week.*_ 📰

18/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I enjoyed the quotes from Oprah Winfrey and Brian Wang that simply tell me to hope for the best and expect the worst an also that what is important is to be significant
18/10/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm glad to hear you found inspiration in the quotes from Oprah Winfrey and Brian Wang. They beautifully encapsulate the idea of hoping for the best while being prepared for the worst, and the importance of making a significant impact in our endeavors. It's wonderful that you're embracing these valuable insights. Keep the spirit of positivity and significance alive in your journey!
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you ma'am
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*, I trust you're doing well. 

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.

01/12/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
