I hope you are doing well! I wanted to inform you that there have been some updates to the rules, and now we require students to show the one-year fee in their bank account. I understand this might be a new requirement and could raise questions.

29/08/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

No matter what challenges you face, believe in yourself and your abilities. Success often comes to those who persevere, stay positive, and keep moving forward.
You have the power to create the future you want. 
How are you doing?
09/09/23, 7:22 am - +264 81 267 7809: M doing good n m staying positive in any challenges
09/09/23, 7:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Why do you think that Nyashazashe?
09/09/23, 7:26 am - +264 81 267 7809: One of the best ways to stay positive when facing challenges is to focus on the things you can control. For example, you can control your thoughts, your actions, and your reactions to a situation. When something is out of your control, it's important to accept that and focus on what you can do to improve the situation. It's also helpful to take a step back and look at the big picture. Remember that a single setback or challenge doesn't define your life. Finally, it's important to find support from friends and family, and to practice self-care.

Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We are excited to hear about your experiences and aspirations.
Best Regards
Ms. Jasmine
