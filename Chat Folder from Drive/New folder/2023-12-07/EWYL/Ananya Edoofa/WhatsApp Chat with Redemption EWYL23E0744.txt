06/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 597 8719: My name is Redemption Musona , I'm the first born in my family, a girl . May goal for now is to pass my A level examination , and from there do my desired course and get myself a career and be able to say that I made it. I love listening to music, reading novels , comics cause. I believe that from reading I will be able to get to know a lot about life , and discover things I didn't know before . I also love athletics
06/10/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Redemption. You know we have a thing in common. I also love reading novels!
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, what's your favorite Genre?
06/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Fantasy and historical fiction
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! That's amazing!
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Could you please enlighten me on the two objectives
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure,the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Thank you for enlightening me on the  two  the goals
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
06/10/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I have read the same and I am very excited to start my EWYL journey so that I can get the scholarship ship credits that will help me to pay for my tuition fees
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We are done with our today's session. Our next session is on Monday. We do not have our sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. 

Happy Weekend!🌸
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Thank you for the session, happy weekend to you too
09/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Redemption!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session? 🚀 <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 597 8719: I'm doing well , and I am ready for the session how are you
09/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
09/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Well understood
09/10/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
09/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes it does sound interesting <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

09/10/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Hall of inspiration section
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
09/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Yes it really is a great deal to he mentioned by the founder himself in the Newsletter
09/10/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Redemption?
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 597 8719: It really sounds great Ms Ananya and I'm looking forward to you walking with me in my EWYL journey
09/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
09/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*

11/10/23, 6:13 am - +263 77 597 8719: From listening to the contents of project 1, I understood that the project is about corporate alliances and the aim is to understand the market which I am going to work in  in the future and start to prepare myself for it at an early age
I have to work with companies that are technologically driven and digital in nature and I also have to identify these type of companies in my country
I also have to create a LinkedIn account and look for companies as well as the employers of that company
I also have to talk to different managers and after I have managed to find the suitable company that is willing to collaborate with Edoofa I have to set a meeting time , for that company to meet with Edoofa
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Redemption,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Noted Ms Ananya , due to the commencement of my A level final exams  in the following week , I won't be available to continue my EWYL journey till 17 November. Hence if it's still ok with you we can continue the EWYL sessions after my examinations, that way I won't be occupied with either exams or lessons from school.
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand; however, I just want you to connect with me for like 15-20 minutes to discuss the process of putting your session on hold. May I ask when we can connect?

11/10/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Redemption, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Well understood Ms Ananya and I would follow all these steps you have mentioned
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 597 8719: So just to make sure tht we are still on the same page, when will I start to connect you with the new number you have provided me with
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You have to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 597 8719: After my examinations or ....
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can do it now,  so that we connect on that number once your exams are over.
11/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 597 8719: Thank you for clarifying Ms Ananya
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, to put your session on hold, as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my exams.

19/10/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

23/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 597 8719: If it's not a problem I would like you to resend all the EWYL projects

23/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 597 8719: There are three EWYL projects 
The first project is called Corporate alliances
Under this project the Edoofians have to represent Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers . This will help them to create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits.

Project 2 is Community Building
Students will reach out to their personal and extended network and offer them an opportunity to be a part of Edoofa's educational ecosystem and acquire international education which prepares them for the future.


Project 3 is African Schools Education Reform Mission

The primary outcome of this project is for students to be able to reach out to local schools in their local region to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. This project is only for senior secondary schools
23/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 597 8719: If it is fine with you we can proceed from where we are currently  with our EWYL journey I just wanted to recover the  projects I had lost

24/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Redemption!

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries?

28/11/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Redemption!

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
28/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 597 8719: Morning Ms Ananya
This is surely fascinating

28/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
28/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 597 8719: I've finished listening to the audio file
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
28/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 597 8719: I've understood that the first project the corporate alliance  aims at making students understand the market they are going to work in ,in the future and start preparing for it at an early stage
The students have to create a LinkedIn account first then find companies and employees of those companies and connect with the decision makers of those companies and tell them to collaborate with Edoofa and once they have agreed then i have to set up a meeting between the decision makers and Edoofa
28/11/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Redemption. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

28/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 597 8719: It was nice chatting with you too 
I am about to finish reading the pdf you sent me about the guide for searching for companies
28/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 597 8719: From this i understood that there are factors to look at  for one to look for the right type of companies these include
Nature of the company
Scale of the company
Financial stability
Background of the founder
 There are also steps that should be followed which include
Step 1 searching
For google i  should use keywords like recently funded start ups
For LinkedIn i should start connecting with the  founders of a few start ups and explore their connections ,activities to get constant updates

Step 2
I should study a little more about the company and its functioning

Step 3
I should study about the website of the company and check if it works properly.

Step 4
I should check various social media pages of the company

Step 5
I should understand and study the background of the founder and other core members

Step 6
I should start reaching out to members of the company by dropping an invitation note and send a connection request .
I should first reach out to the heads to various departments before connecting with the founders of the company
29/11/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Redemption!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️
29/11/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 597 8719: Morning
That is surely an interesting fact Ms Ananya
29/11/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
30/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 597 8719: Well noted Ms Ananya
30/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 597 8719: Well understood Ms Ananya
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

30/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 597 8719: Noted Ms Ananya
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
