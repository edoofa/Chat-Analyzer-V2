06/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your daughter is, what are her strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
06/12/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 857 3350: I'm I'm tendai jembere's father and husband to S Angelina Makoni. We are a small educated family. We have three kids. Jesca Jembere, courage Jembere and tendai jembere. My wife, she is a professional teacher, teaching at primary Level. My first born she is a nurse here in Zimbabwe and my son is also a teacher. Teaching is like genetics within our family, I'm also a teacher. However the economic situation on our country is not favorable so we are financial constrained but we have been trying for tendai and we managed to pay for her secondary level and she passed both O and  A level studies 

Tendai is a hard working girl a well behaved daughter. She strive by all means to succeed in life and she made us proud when she passed here o and A level studies. With this opportunity coming we are more than happy, she is showing that she can't give up on her academic journey  even tho we are financially crippled. Again as the father I'm not giving up on her we will push harder for tendai to achieve her goals

Tendai she is a kind hearted person, who is value free she can accommodate everyone and she always do good to others. 

Like everyone she got her weaknesses, she works too hard to achieve her goals she can't rest if she wants to achieve something. I concidered that as a weakness. However all in all I see her as a very strong women... and she will prosper and never disappoint us
06/12/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 857 3350: I have a diploma in education together with my wife. Our whole life we have been teaching. So education is of great importance in our family,  and it was easy for us to groom our children. We encouraged them to focus more on education. 

I think tendai started to develop interest in agriculture long back probably because we live in rural area where agriculture is the only basic area which gives us money and food. Therefore to her learning and studying agriculture will help her and the community to utilise the land and commercializing agriculture for the betterment of everyone  and it helped here to choose agriculture at A level and now willing to do it at university level.
