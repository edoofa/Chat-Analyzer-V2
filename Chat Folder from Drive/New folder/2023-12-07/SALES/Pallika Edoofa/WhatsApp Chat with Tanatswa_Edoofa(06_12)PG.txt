06/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 834 8363: Well we had a set back in physics for a short period but believe we polished up on vacation school and the time we wrote l was better
06/12/23, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tanatswa, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

06/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 834 8363: Understood
06/12/23, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanatswa, I would like to know if you are interested in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering, so, why haven't you opted for Chemistry in your A level?
06/12/23, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 834 8363: Well l am interested in aircraft engineering also pilotry.and did not choose chemistry well did not really engage

06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanatswa, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 834 8363: No l am not
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanatswa, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 834 8363: It is affordable also with the earn while you learn it is better
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 834 8363: No l dont
06/12/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
