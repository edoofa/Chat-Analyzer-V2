20/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 086 8163: Yes  we can
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ruramai,
I hope that you are doing well today.
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ruramai, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Persistance ?*
20/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 086 8163: 1. My first motivation to apply for the Edoofa Schorlaship program is to esteem my life through international recognized degrees ,doing international law in India more to that India is an economically stable country with better living conditions
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 086 8163: 2 my understanding of the program *Edoofa Program Benefits* 


 *Edoofa: Education for All.* 
The Edoofa program is the result of years of dedication of our founders *[Mr.Angad & Mr.Avreen Singh]* 
towards solving two of the most important problems in the current education system- lack of 
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success anymore.

• The industry 
moves at a very fast pace in this digital era and students need to prepare not only for the jobs of 
today but also of the future. 
That can happen only through *real experience and exposure.* 

• What Edoofa has managed to accomplish is *unique and transformative* - providing a higher 
education that is of a *global standard* , the *most affordable* and is *highly employment oriented* .
No student or parent should be crushed by debt for wanting a better future ahead.

• Edoofa was 
built to provide a forward-thinking, world-class education that prepares students for the jobs of 
today and tomorrow.

• There are quite some few reasons for Edoofa program being the best scholarship program for 
International students:

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a 
decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed the lives of 
thousands of students. 
This unique benefit comes to all our students where they get to 
learn and make great career decisions because of the help and mentorship that our 
expert counsellors give.

● *Higher Education Concierge* (care-taker); this is also one of the unique benefits and 
valuable services that our students enjoy. No other college or program offers this level 
of mentorship which starts before the admission and stays with the students 
throughout their college journey.

All our University campuses have Edoofa offices and Edoofa campus managers are 
there with the International students to help them with all the aspects of education —
from Academic to SEELS, from hostel to food, from teaching staff to other extra 
activities, from making friends and joining communities to having access to events and 
other extra -curricular activities — *Our students rely on the full-fledged support*
*provided by our campus managers.*

 No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to 
them during their course of Education!
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 086 8163: In short the Edoofa program Schorlaship is trying to uplift the Academic life of International students

20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries.

20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 



The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
