11/07/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: Good to hear that
I am doing well, thanks for asking

While the evaluations of our Academic Board was progressing, it was observed that Lauren's course- Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science is offered a lower quantum of scholarship. At the same time, the course, Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology offered Lauren's application a higher quantum of scholarship(90-100%) thereby reducing the costs to $1200-$1800 per annum.
11/07/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: So would you like to understand more on the course Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology?
11/07/23, 3:37 pm - +265 992 23 12 01: Yeah sure
11/07/23, 3:38 pm - Austin: *BSc Biotechnology* is a 3-year undergraduate course that allows the candidates to learn how technology is utilized to create useful and necessary products from living organisms.

BSc Biotechnology Syllabus includes subjects such as Organic Mechanisms in Biology, Microbial Genetics, Molecular Genetics, DNA Typing, Proteomics & Beyond, etc. 

After completing BSc Biotechnology, students can opt for MSc Biotechnology or other similar Biotechnology Courses available in India to grow their career in the field of Biotechnology.

*What is BSc Biotechnology?*
Biotechnology is one of the most important fields in modern scientific research as the field deals with the application of biology and different techniques to modify products so that it can be used for human needs. The three year undergraduate course equips the aspirants with skills to alter the DNA of various living organisms.

*Why Study BSc Biotechnology?* 
BSc Biotechnology has lots of prospective career opportunities to offer to the students. Some of the benefits of pursuing the graduation in Biotechnology program are as follows:

>After completion of this course candidates will be equipped with the skills to excel in the Bioinformatics and Computer-Assisted Research and Analysis. 
>As this course covers a variety of practices and technical knowledge required in the medical field, it opens up a number of career prospects for the candidate. 
>Due to the constant innovation found in all industries nowadays, students can be assured of longevity in employment due to their knowledge in the field of Computer Science. This allows students to adapt their skills and knowledge to any changes in the industry.
>Candidates who keep their knowledge updated according to the current trends and data will also have the option to diversify into the field of education. This is quite a popular career for graduates of BSc Biotechnology. 
>Another unique feature of this course is the inclusion of a Management & Entrepreneurship paper in the final semester. This equips graduates with the skills to perform well in positions of management and administration.

*Who Should Study BSc Biotechnology*
>Candidates who have interest in genetics should pursue this subject as a career option.
>Career as a biotechnologist requires continuous research in different fields. The candidates who are enthusiastic about research can opt for this course.
>The biotechnologist works on altering the genetic material of plants and animals so that the production food and lifestocks increases . >Candidates who wish to work on food security can find interest in this course.
>Students who are enthusiastic to develop drugs and vaccines can pursue this course.

*BSc Biotechnology Curriculum* 
The BSc Biotechnology Curriculum is generally divided into 6 semesters. The average length of each semester is 6 months. Candidates mainly learn about the core subjects in their second and third year. The candidates are sometimes required to go for a training in the final year of the course.
