02/09/23, 12:17 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

EDOOFA is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is *inclusive and equitable for all* by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than *1500* stduents to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than *100 schools* with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we now look to close the *2023 academic year with 500 proud Edoofians of Zambia*. 

Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including *Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others*. We are also connected with institutions like *Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding* among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia.

07/09/23, 6:11 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *9:00 am CAT on Friday(08/09/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

*“Each day comes bearing its gifts. Untie the ribbon.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
09/09/23, 10:42 am - +260 772955982: Yes
09/09/23, 10:43 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
09/09/23, 10:44 am - +260 772955982: Am fine thank you
09/09/23, 10:44 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
09/09/23, 10:44 am - Arshita: Please answer this
09/09/23, 12:13 pm - +260 772955982: My family
09/09/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/09/23, 12:15 pm - +260 772955982: They feel its a good thing as it is a person who studies abroad has high chances of employment
09/09/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
09/09/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
09/09/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/09/23, 1:23 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *9:30 am CAT on Monday(11/09/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

I was looking forward to your response .

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation.
09/09/23, 5:33 pm - +260 772955982: Okay
11/09/23, 8:01 am - +260 772955982: Yes
11/09/23, 9:39 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
11/09/23, 9:39 am - +260 772955982: Greetings how are you
11/09/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
11/09/23, 9:43 am - +260 772955982: Am fine thank you
11/09/23, 9:44 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
11/09/23, 9:44 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
11/09/23, 9:49 am - +260 772955982: Yes
11/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
11/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
11/09/23, 9:54 am - +260 772955982: Yes
11/09/23, 9:55 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/09/23, 9:55 am - Arshita: However Mwamba, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/09/23, 9:58 am - +260 772955982: Okay
11/09/23, 10:01 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 10:02 am - +260 772955982: Stage one
11/09/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/09/23, 10:05 am - +260 772955982: Yes
11/09/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
11/09/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
11/09/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/09/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
11/09/23, 10:07 am - +260 772955982: Yes i am very clear
11/09/23, 10:16 am - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
