They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.

01/11/23, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
01/11/23, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
01/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 796 8606: I think the EWYL program is really good and will be really helpful both in acquiring skills and reducing the cost of fees
01/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 796 8606: So you will get to participate in the EWYL program after what exactly?
01/11/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
01/11/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You will get to work in the EWYL Program after your enrollment into the program. <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Wow, this is really amazing, then so it will just be like paying my own fees
01/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 796 8606: So does it mean l can start even on my first semester?
01/11/23, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Munashe
01/11/23, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
01/11/23, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
01/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 796 8606: I think number 1, the counseling really opened my mind to the wonders of the Edoofa program
01/11/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Expert Career Counseling*


Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

01/11/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Wow, that's a lot of earning,
01/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 796 8606: My dad
01/11/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Munashe, That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/11/23, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is!!
01/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 796 8606: They are actually interested in the idea of such an opportunity
01/11/23, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Munashe, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
01/11/23, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
01/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Yeah that's it
01/11/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
01/11/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
01/11/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
01/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Yes go on please
01/11/23, 1:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Munashe, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
01/11/23, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Oh okay that's reasonable, so after paying, is it guaranteed that I will get a place to study abroad?
01/11/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Munashe.
01/11/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 796 8606: I guess 5,but we didn't talk about the interview though
01/11/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Munashe,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Okay
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
01/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Yes thank you so much for the guidance
01/11/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Munashe, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
01/11/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

06/12/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Am sorry Ms Pallika but I don't think we can afford the fees, thank you for your help
06/12/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: Good Evening Munashe!
Which fees do you feel is unaffordable to your family and have you compared the same with the fees in Universities in Zimbabwe?

06/12/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Semester
06/12/23, 9:55 pm - Austin: Munashe, I think you have misunderstood
06/12/23, 9:55 pm - Austin: The mentioned range is annual fee not semester fee
06/12/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 796 8606: So you mean I will be paying $1000 per semester?
06/12/23, 10:25 pm - Austin: That is right, if your cost of education per annum is $2000 , then you will be paying $1000 per semester which can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program
06/12/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 796 8606: Does this include accommodation and food or it's just tuition fee
06/12/23, 10:35 pm - Austin: It includes Tuition, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, laundry, library fee etc
06/12/23, 10:35 pm - Austin: Please refer to the same
