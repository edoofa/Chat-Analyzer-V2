28/11/23, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 898 6737: 1.India has good quality of education therefore my qualification will be regarded one of the best so it's going to be easier of me to get employed because of my qualification background which is being  an Edoofian. 


I will achieve my career aspirations by working hard ,and seizing opportunities when l see them ..l want to move ahead of the pack not to outperform others but to achieve more and aiming  higher because No sweat    there is No sweet
28/11/23, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Silebele, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 898 6737: Yes we're aware but we were hoping to get a scholarship
28/11/23, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Silebele, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 424 2074: We appreciate
28/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Yes
28/11/23, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Ms. Dube!!
28/11/23, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
28/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 424 2074: No we don't .we will greatly appreciate the information
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
28/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 898 6737: Yes it's good for me and l think l will benefit a  lot and gaining experiences in life
28/11/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Noted thank you so much
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're welcome!!
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As we about to end, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 424 2074: I liked them all

28/11/23, 7:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
28/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Wow this is great
28/11/23, 7:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, Ms. Dube
28/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 424 2074: But I noticed that almost all earned 75 dollars
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Dube, It depends upon their hardwork!!
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Noted
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Ms. Dube,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family as well after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feel about you studying abroad?
28/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Thank you it has been great talking to you . Our family is familiar with this situation as other family members did nursing abroad except for me .so I know we won't face any challenges
28/11/23, 7:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Dube, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Silebele's career advance at an even greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting her family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents.
28/11/23, 7:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
28/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 424 2074: True
28/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 898 6737: I feel grateful and inspired by it ,it's a life time opportunity  and my family is looking forward to it
28/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Police clearance ,verification of certificates ,passports and visas I guess might be needed as well
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Dube, These will also be required, but the main requirements are those that I have listed above.
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Silebele.
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Noted
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 898 6737: Noted
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Yes we would love to hear about it
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Ms. Dube, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Dube,

We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
28/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Yes

28/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Dube, Kindly excuse me for the same!!
28/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As if she found eligible, she will be enrolled for 2024 intake
28/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain that!!
28/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Noted
28/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
28/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
28/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process now.
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 898 6737: Yes
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 424 2074: Noted

I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

29/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 898 6737: My family are grateful for this opportunity and they want to be with me with every step l take beacuse without a general an army is lost. They won't give up on this opportunity no matter what it takes because they see Edoofa scholarship program as a good institution where l will create my own image ..They are praying for me to get enrolled on August 2024 even if the road its gonna be difficult but we will take it with both hands .They are motivated by that Edoofa has many branches all over include in Zimbabwe and that makes them to choose it for me and besides my parents l also consider it the best afterall my choice is the best .They want me to pursue my goals and dreams and become an independent women ,stand on my own because spoon feeding is not good. Moreover they have trust in me bacause they no that they are not watering for nothing soon or later they will receive outputs. 

Apart from everything the method of paying small amounts every month,they are good with it like you said it will give them time to prapare everything so they won't fail to pay it every month .They are happy with Earn while You Learn Program because it will help with to gain experience and not to suffer because of shortage of income and that will give them peace knowing that l have everything and will also assist on paying my fees till l.finish my studies  ..furthermore after seeing so many pictures of black Edoofians they are proud of it and happy that l will represent my family there and proud to be a black person  .Also l am a girl and most people think a girl child can't make it so they think l will motivate other children even family children and they will want to fly high as me if l get enrolled  


Therefore as a Dube Family we are grateful n appriciate this opportunity
