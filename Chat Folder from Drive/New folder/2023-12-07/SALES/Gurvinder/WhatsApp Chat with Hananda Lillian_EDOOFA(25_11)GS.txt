*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 8:02 am - +263 77 490 6366: Morning sir
01/12/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 490 6366: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: I see that you are well informed.
01/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
01/12/23, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes sir
01/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 490 6366: Okay sir
01/12/23, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 490 6366: It is sir an I hope to have such a great opportunity
01/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Lillian, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
01/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
01/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/12/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 490 6366: Ok
01/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I do sir  I do
01/12/23, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Lillian, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

01/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 490 6366: So my name is Lillian Hananda .I am 19 years old and I just finished writing my A level and I'm hoping to go to university. In my O Level I came out with eight subjects out of 10 and I am waiting for my A level results. Personally I am a self-motivated person I work hard and I actually Excel more through things that involve hands and talking to people also writing I can interpret something through writing too. I personally am hoping to do a social work program this is because I am a person who would like to assist those who  are need and the underprivileged ,those who need assistance in life. Social work gives me a broad way of doing it not just doing it in my community but also in other countries. I come from a family of five which has two parents and two siblings. My father is a police officer my mom is a housewife and we live in  Zvishavane Police Camp
01/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 490 6366: This should help
01/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Great answer, Lillian.
01/12/23, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: So Lillian, could you kindly tell me how much *Chibi High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
01/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 490 6366: School fees $415 .My father he is a Police  officer

01/12/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study social work, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
01/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 490 6366: My motivation in social work began when I saw children being mistreated by parents and the people in the society an, also discrimination of women and their rights and  discrimination of people by color . Studying social work and becoming a social worker enables me to be able to help people in at a large scale that is   I can help children, can help women and I can help those who are discriminated. Ever since I was a child I've always liked helping people so I decided to become a  social worker this is because I feel a joy and a happiness inside when a person is relieved from the problem that they were facing or the discrimination that they're facing this is what motivated me to want to become a social worker
01/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: That is a noble thought, Lillian.
01/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 490 6366: Thank you sir
01/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
01/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 574 3360: Good morning Mr Gurvinder .As Lillian's parent l  have also seen that she has a passion for being involved in the betterment of others around her as she has helped to spearhead one of the charity organizations at her school that has helped underprivileged children

01/12/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
01/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 490 6366: Thank u sir I do appreciate you for taking out time to help me in looking for an ideal career that will help me achieve my dreams and aspirations
01/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 490 6366: If I am ask does the Edoofa Scholarship Program have scholarship spots for someone looking to study *B.A.(Hons.) in Sociology*
01/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Yes Lillian, you do not have to worry about that.
01/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: But I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
01/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I am Mr Gurvinder
01/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 490 6366: That is very flexible sir
01/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
01/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 490 6366: Thank you sir
01/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the course?
01/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes Mr Gurvinder please do
01/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.
01/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: *Course Outline*

This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people’s lives and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by.

01/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 490 6366: This is a really good course Mr Gurvinder
01/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I did sir
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 490 6366: And I do understand it provides a lot of opportunities so I understand it for
01/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
01/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I have understood that through this program I am taught  traditions and cultures and how to help a society. In 5 years I see myself working for a non-governmental organization or working for the government being able to help those who need  help. I see myself achieving greater goals than those that I want to achieve. I see myself as an inspiration for future people  who would like to go through this scholarship in order to achieve greater in life. If it is to say I am awarded the scholarship I will work hard and see to it that in the next 5 years I would have made a difference.Hence in the next 5 years I see myself as a person who's going to be able  to inspire other people to go through this program  that will assist them in their carrer path as they are into social work or sociology. Thank you
01/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lillian, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
01/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Yes Mr Gurvinder I am will to work hard for it
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I would like to study abroad and not in my country because of the school fees in Zimbabwe. These prices are raising higher and higher every day which is not affordable. If I study   abroad on a scholarship and it is much cheaper this would be easier for my parents to take me through education. I would also like to experience different cultures and meet different people from different backgrounds. This information also helps me in getting to know and to understand different cultures traditions and values of people and how i can help them through the course that i have decided to take which is*B.A(Hon.)in Sociology*
01/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 490 6366: To improve the educational system my country. I would like to sponsor a number of children into school and assist them through school up until University that is God willing and I would also help those less privileged especially from the rural areas to be able to go to school to have uniforms to go to school and also try to assist them in motivating them to do school work so that they can achieve greater
01/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lillian, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree? <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I do agree sir
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I am curious why is it that we need to study in India
01/12/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
01/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

01/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
01/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 490 6366: No we are not aware please assist how much is  it
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Ok this is good sir n affordable
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Lillian, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Ok noted
01/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
01/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Yes sir if u can
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Lillian, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 490 6366: This is a very good program makes a person to learn responsibility and still learn
01/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
01/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I think this will really benefit me a lot
01/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lillian, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 490 6366: This is really nice and promising
01/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
01/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Understood sir
01/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I do see that Edoofa is different
01/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Lillian, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
01/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I now fully understand
01/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lillian, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
02/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes sir
02/12/23, 11:14 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
02/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I have
02/12/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 490 6366: Ok sir can we start at 1200
02/12/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Can you tell me the reason for this delay?
02/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 490 6366: I wanted to  secure data n network
02/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Noted, just remember that we are just about to end the counselling session, and if we delay it any more then it hampers your chance of securing a higher quantum of scholarship, so I would like you to be on time.
02/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 490 6366: .I Will be ready by 12
02/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
02/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Hello sir
02/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: So are you ready now?
02/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Yes sir
02/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Lillian as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 490 6366: 15000or even more
02/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Lillian, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Ok sir
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I do think so
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
02/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: However Lillian, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Ok understood
02/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 490 6366: No please take me through it
02/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lillian, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
02/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
02/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Yes I have
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 490 6366: So if it's just to say I have 50% scholarship would that mean you would pay 50% off the scholarship let's say they say the fees is 3,000 you'd pay $1,500 and what about plane ticket and also where I would stay
02/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Lillian, the cost of travelling to India is a one time cost, in that too our experts will be there to guide you through the VISA application, and for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: The University provides accommodation inside the campus which is very affordable.
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 490 6366: Okay sir
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
02/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 490 6366: I have understood
04/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Hello @263774906366 @263775743360.

As your counsellor, I feel you are suitable for the program, so I have decided to do the eligibility check evaluation myself.

Are we good to proceed ahead?
04/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Lillian, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Hello @263774906366 @263775743360.

As your counsellor, I feel you are suitable for the program, so I have decided to do the eligibility check evaluation myself.

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
