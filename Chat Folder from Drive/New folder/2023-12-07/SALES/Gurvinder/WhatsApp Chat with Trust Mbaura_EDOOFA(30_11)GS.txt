I am a self-motivated with a couple of self help books and videos. This gives me a sense of high encouragement to become what I want to be. I am serious with my studies, day and night,non stop. I always have a strong belief in what I want such that nobody can grab me from my road to success.
My biggest weakness is that I end up wanting to try everything I no one wants to help me in my path to success. I hate non influencers such that I end up isolating myself if such people are around me.
I love reading motivational books during my spare time.
