09/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 682 2706: Yes sure
09/11/23, 2:17 pm - Tushti: Alright so Mirirai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

From a family of 5 where I live with my parents ,mom a general hand and my father who is unemployed. I am currently in L6 and I'm doing Business studies,economics and statistics and geography.

09/11/23, 6:36 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
09/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 682 2706: Yes they are sometimes my sister can be turned away from school due to inability to pay fees

17/11/23, 9:54 am - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
04/12/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 682 2706: Hie how are you hope you are well , me I'm fine, had some challenges with data and my phone, I really need your assistance if there is still a chance please do assist and let us carry on . The break was beyond my control my apologies.
