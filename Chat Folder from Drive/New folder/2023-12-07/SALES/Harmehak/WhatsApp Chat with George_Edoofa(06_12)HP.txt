What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? Its a scholarship program that seeks to promote educational development through offering a guaranteed 50% scholarship hence lessening tuition burdens to those with low incomes.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? My income is very meagre hence i am incapacitated to fund my education.
