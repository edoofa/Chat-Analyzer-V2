So how was your experience?
17/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 931 8011: My experience was wonderful I learnt a lot of things from the student's experience . I learnt that learning abroad offers more than just education it also offers new caltures,new experiences and gives an opportunity to meet new people with different experiences and different point of views.The video also tought me that you have to aim higher to archive more,don't limit yourself learn to broaden your horizons no matter how tough your situation maybe there is always an alternative solution for example in this situation Edoofa is my solution. I also learnt that Edoofa is the people's choice due to it's affordability, employability afterwards, accessibility plus it is a program that is trustworthy.Another aspect i admired is that the Edoofa program will always be of assistance even after helping you in attaining a good college thereby meaning that in case of emergencies or problems you are able to assist.I got the vibe that everything that the program is about is true especially the earn while you learn
17/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see that you thoroughly watched it and happened to learn more about the program.
17/11/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Tawanda, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Lyvinia!

17/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I understood that the Edoofa program is all about helping student to study abroad with affordable prices, quality education and even enriching strong and helpful human values. I also learnt that education is not about learning the theory or the practical independently but it is about enriching both qualities at the same time like the EWYL program.I also understood that the Edoofa program is a scholarship offering  program which does not descriminate between cultures, believes or personal values but rather it accepts all student throughout the country
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I also learnt that the Edoofa program is a partial scholarship but in some cases it can offer up to 100 percent .It is a program that does not leave you even if you find your desired college but they help you throughout the way. The Edoofa program aim to make it's students employable and desirable internationally.

20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Tawanda, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Thank you mem for sharing this  information with me . I am delighted to be part of something that is as big as this program. Thank you , you are really appreciated
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tawanda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St Anthony's high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Since you already know my name let me start by saying that I am an introvert, I like to do things on my own. Before I make any crucial descions I like to think twice an make the best possible choice. I am a person who has found his interests in computers and technology. I started my grade 1 in 2012 and finished my primary level in 2018 at Rudhanda primary schoool. I then continued my high school at St Anthony's High School. Our current school fees is  about 400 USD. After high school I would like to do further study in Computer sciences since I am currently doing 4 A level subjects ( MATHS , PHYSICS , CHEMISTRY AND COMPUTER SCIENCES) Well personally I think that my strength is the ability to never give up , I vowed to myself that no matter how difficult it may get I will never loose hope . Well my weakness is social interaction I find it very difficult to form social relationships with people especially my peers , I   am much of a loner. I am a person who likes to partake in many extracurricular activities for example i play volleyball, I sing sing in the school Qiour. I am also part of a group called computer sciences wizard at school, we partake on fixing broken CPUs at school. I am a very ambitious person one day I hope to change the world with my ideas. Of resources permit I would like to introduce my software, this software will change the educational system all over the world

A detailed description on family background 
Well my mother is my only guardian she is a a teacher her highest level of education is a diploma. I have one sibling ,my older brother he is currently in the US doing his undergraduate degree under a scholarship. Currently I live with my mother and my cousin at my mother's work place   since we don't have a decent home to stay. Well as of my father I don't know his occupation since he left the country after he divorced my mother. All I know about him is that he   left the country. My mother is our only source of income so it's really hard on  her since she also has to support our Grandmother.

20/11/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Well Tawanda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Yes
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I believe I am
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
20/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Tawanda.
20/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Yes they are aware
20/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 931 8011: They are willing to support me both financially and mentally
20/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Network issue
20/11/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: I understand please.
20/11/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: It's great that they are willing.

Are you aware we are proudly associated with your school?
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Yes I was aware there was this guy who came and told us about this program
20/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

There are students from the school who are already a part of the program and we look forward to you joining them, Tawanda.
20/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I am also looking forward to joining them
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: That's good
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I am confident I will attain 20 points
20/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Another issue I that I would like to know if I can get 100 percent scholarship
20/11/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/11/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Sure, what's your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Tawanda?
20/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Full coverage
20/11/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
20/11/23, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
20/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Okay thank you I have understood
21/11/23, 7:33 am - +263 71 931 8011: Ok
21/11/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I would be connecting with you at *12 PM CAT today* since I have to attend an urgent meeting.
21/11/23, 11:54 am - +263 71 931 8011: Ok
21/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Hello Everyone!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Yes
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind delayed response, Tawanda?
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Network plus Power. Problems
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: I can understand
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Computer Engineering?
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I at school right now so I will be in between lessons so I will be really busy attending lessons
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: You can address the same now.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Okay well growing up it was very tough for me and my family we had little access to technology. I was always eager to find out more about technology and it's transformation. Having such a background myself I would like to change it for all those who come after me.During the covid era some other student who had financially stable parents partook in online lessons whereas for those like me we had to wait for the Covid 19 protocols to be lifted. Having faced this situation it made me choose this department since I want to make technology available and accessable for the under preveledged like me . I would like to introduce a software that can make online education affordable, available and accessable for everyone.
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 931 8011: For my results my mom will send the document
21/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright please

22/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Well in five years from now I see myself running a software design company after getting admitted into Edoofa program. This company will be there to ensure a huge change in the educational system of all students especially in Africa. This company will be producing the most user friendly softwares that ensue maximum understanding and communication between software and user. These software will come with affordability and usability for everyone since they can take voice commands and can also output sound making them usable even for the phsically impared.Edoofa is there to ensure that I get the quality education and field experience that will allow all my ambitions to be fufiled. Without the support from your program I might not even go to college since my mom isn't capable of paying for my college funds
22/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tawanda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations, I understand what you are sharing.

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 931 8011: I would like to broaden my horizons , meeting new people with better experiences and creating opportunities for myself through new people with different views. I believe that my home country has good educational experiences but I would like a to build something that will last and something that comes from real experience and think that this can be archived through studying abroad and through your program that has tought me that education is a compination of the theory and practical thereby i would like to gain both experiences unlike here in my home country we only learn the theoretical part but never the practical which makes us incompitable for  any job
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Tawanda, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
22/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 71 931 8011: There are top  Indian universities, where integrates skill development and practical training into our curriculum. This approach ensures that I not only graduate with academic knowledge but also with the skills that employers are actively looking for. The diversity of the Indian culture makes me even more eager to visit India. I would like to meet new people with different views and opinions on different things which opens up my eyes to different choices. Indian universities offer one of the best education in the whole world which is my main aim to study there. Other thing that makes me what to study there is the culture , people in India do not decriminate due to skin colour but they accept you as who you are. Another thing I also like about India is how the people stand to thier value, they always stay true to theirselves no matter the situation. In my life I have never boarded a train I believe this could also be my chance to travel and meet new people.
22/11/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Admirable knowledge and research, Tawanda.

23/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Good evening.Poor network here ,sorry
23/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
23/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Have you the discussion so far Mrs Tavengwa?
23/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Please come again
23/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: Have you been following my discussion with Tawanda please?
23/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Yes
23/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 531 8011: No,we haven't any idea.
23/11/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
23/11/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Thank you Ms Harmehak.Now understood.
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Trying to download this one
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Thats will be great because as for me its difficult  to pay even $2000 per because I am earning only $250 per month.
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mrs Tavengwa!
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you how the Earn While You Learn Program would help you and Tawanda!
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Thank you. I have understood Ms Harmehak.
23/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: I am pleased to have you thoroughly following.
23/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 531 8011: So Edoofa is doing a great job?
23/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
23/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Thats really wonderful,Willing to know if you have adimmitted my child to this program?
23/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are in the counseling stage please.

From tomorrow he would proceed for his interview stage to get accepted into the program.
23/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Tavengwa, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 531 8011: As for Tawanda today ,i think he faced power challenges or they were busy with lessons plus its a boarding school where cell phones are prohibited.
23/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

I appreciate your participation in the discussion on his behalf too.
23/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Yes l am
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tavengwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 531 8011: $1500-$2250
23/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Tavengwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Even $750 its unaffordable again,especially poor people like us.
23/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: It's $350 please, and it's paid in installments, Mrs Tavengwa
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 531 8011: I think that will be good
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 531 8011: That one can be manageble
23/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to have you share the same!
23/11/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

23/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Kindly excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the academic board.

So shall we start your session now ?
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Yes
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Noted
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 7 th  or 8 th December 2023 for $200 and the  7 th  or 8 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 7th  or 8th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Let me see .I will come back to you
02/12/23, 4:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
02/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 531 8011: Not prepared to pay that amount
02/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 531 8011: I dont think l will  manage to get  the money since I will be busy preparing  his first term 2024 fees
02/12/23, 7:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Seats are being reserved in advance due to the multi-step process involved in studying abroad. The reservation process for 2025 will conclude by the end of this month. Additionally, I'd like to hear your insights on the session you had with your counselor and what you've gathered regarding the advantages of securing a seat early.
02/12/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 931 8011: Ok
04/12/23, 12:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
