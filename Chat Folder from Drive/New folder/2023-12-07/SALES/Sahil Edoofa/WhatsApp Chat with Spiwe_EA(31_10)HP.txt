03/11/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: That's great, Spiwe!

Could you please add more regarding the finances and tuition fee?
03/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 73 529 2896: Okay :
The average cost of education in India for international students is
$6000-$8000/year. That’s the standard. But it is only because of Edoofa, that if
you’re found eligible for our program, you’ll have the chance to get admission into
one of our seats as part of the $10 Million Scholarship Fund which has been made
available only because of Edoofa’s good work with the government recognized and
accredited universities, schools & colleges over the last 13 years. With the help of
this fund, the fee comes down to $2000-$3000/year.
That is why Edoofa rigorously interviews each student to declare them eligible for
the program. One of the things which they value, which they look for in a student is the
right attitude and discipline.
As long as a student continues to demonstrate the right attitude, and discipline and
maintain decorum like a sincere student with merit, the scholarship will continue to
exist and the fee will be $2000-$3000/year.
03/11/23, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Spiwe!

Comprehensive Understanding of the Fashion Industry: Combining fashion design with business administration can provide you with a unique skill set. You'll not only be able to create beautiful designs but also understand the market, consumer behavior, and the business side of the fashion industry, making you a well-rounded professional.

Networking Opportunities: Business administration programs often offer opportunities for networking with professionals from different backgrounds. These connections can be valuable for your career, helping you gain insights and access to potential job opportunities.

Problem-Solving and Decision-Making Skills: Business administration programs emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. These skills can be extremely beneficial in the fashion industry, where you might need to make quick decisions on design, production, and marketing.

Risk Management: Understanding risk and financial management can be crucial in the fashion industry, which often involves investment in materials, production, and marketing. Your business administration background will help you make informed decisions and minimize risks.

Market Research Skills: Business administration includes market research, which can be invaluable in fashion design. Knowing what consumers want and staying up-to-date with industry trends is essential for success in the clothing design and construction pattern design fields.

Why l don't want to study in my country is there is no much exposure to many things .
04/11/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: You see, Spiwe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
04/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes that's the situation here
04/11/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts, Spiwe 

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

04/11/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Spiwe.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Can you come again
04/11/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of the costs of education in India without the Scholarship, Spiwe?
04/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Am not aware
04/11/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/11/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay l understand
04/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 73 529 2896: That's great
04/11/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Spiwe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay
04/11/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Spiwe, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
04/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay that is good
04/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes l do agree
04/11/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making education affordable and accessible for international students here in India?
04/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes l can relate, Edoofa is reducing the cost of education of a student from a higher amount to a lower one and the amount will include accomodation , food and basic university expenses
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Oky l get it
04/11/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 73 529 2896: That's awesome
04/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 73 529 2896: That is good
04/11/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes that will be fine
04/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay
04/11/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the pictures and video Spiwe?
04/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 73 529 2896: I went through the pictures the video l didn't because  l don't have much data to download
04/11/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

Do go through once you have data!
04/11/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Spiwe, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Oky will do so
04/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes l am ready
04/11/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Spiwe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay good
04/11/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Kindly follow properly, Spiwe!

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay , the student will end up paying $1500- $2250
04/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes parents can't afford it .
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 73 529 2896: That's great
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Spiwe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes l think so
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Oky l get it
04/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 73 529 2896: This will be great
04/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/11/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay
04/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes l understand
04/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Yes
04/11/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/11/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/11/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

04/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Okay l get it
04/11/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/11/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

04/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 73 529 2896: Will download when l buy data
04/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 73 529 2896: My battery is now low
04/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 73 529 2896: There is no electricity here
04/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: We have concluded the session itself please.
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
