18/08/23, 2:27 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes ma'am I do!
18/08/23, 2:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 8:30am to 9:30 am (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.

It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
18/08/23, 2:35 pm - +250 791 847 538: Thank you so much Ms Tenzin. 

The meeting hours are very fine with me. I am glad because morning hours are my productivity period as well.

Noted; I shall message me five minutes prior to mark my attendance.

I am looking forward to working with you towards all of it. 

I'm usually a freelancer, so I am guessing I shall not be difficult to figure out everything.

Thank you for assistance Ms Tenzin.
18/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am sure, We will do great together.
18/08/23, 4:49 pm - +250 791 847 538: So do I.🙏

I'm doing wonderfully great
19/08/23, 9:23 am - +250 791 847 538: My apologies, I was late to reply because I was not expecting your text in the weekends.
19/08/23, 9:43 am - +91 78273 08969: It is okay, I just wanted to greet you.
19/08/23, 10:14 am - +250 791 847 538: Oh thank you!

"Every day, think as you wake up: Today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, and I am not going to waste it." - Dalai Lama
21/08/23, 8:35 am - +91 78273 08969: How are you today?
21/08/23, 8:36 am - +250 791 847 538: Today I'm doing wonderfully well.
21/08/23, 8:36 am - +250 791 847 538: How are you? How was the weekend?
21/08/23, 8:36 am - +91 78273 08969: I am well, I had a great weekend.
21/08/23, 8:37 am - +250 791 847 538: Great, I'm glad
21/08/23, 8:38 am - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/08/23, 8:39 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank you, please enlighten me?
21/08/23, 8:41 am - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/08/23, 8:44 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes that is so amazingly interesting. I'm so glad that one gets self-finance their education.
21/08/23, 8:46 am - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/08/23, 8:48 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank you, I'm looking forward to walking with the team through out this journey.
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Amani?
21/08/23, 8:50 am - +250 791 847 538: That sounds amazing.
21/08/23, 8:51 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
21/08/23, 8:53 am - +250 791 847 538: Wow!! It sounds really interesting.
21/08/23, 8:54 am - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
21/08/23, 8:54 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 8:55 am - +250 791 847 538: Sure thing, let me go through it.
21/08/23, 9:07 am - +250 791 847 538: EDOOFA HALL OF INSPIRATION is my best part of the newsletter. Oh my God, I'm so moved and inspired by the story.
21/08/23, 9:12 am - +91 78273 08969: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
21/08/23, 9:20 am - +250 791 847 538: Very much so
21/08/23, 9:20 am - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
21/08/23, 9:22 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes I am ready
21/08/23, 9:24 am - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
21/08/23, 9:32 am - +250 791 847 538: 1. So there's my *EWYL mentor* who's called Ms. Tenzin, Ms. Deepali who's *the head of department* and Ms. Davi who's the head coach. Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi ensure and evaluate that Edoofians achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course.

2. First, is Equal opportunity.
Second is self-finance their education.

3. Newsletter

4. The Hall of Inspiration; It's simply like *SUCCESS STORIES* for inspiration designed to inspire and motivate the Edoofians at large.
21/08/23, 9:43 am - +91 78273 08969: Your answers showcase a strong grasp of the concepts we have been discussing. Your ability to articulate your thoughts and ideas clearly and concisely is truly impressive. Keep up the excellent work.
21/08/23, 9:47 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank you for your kind words!
21/08/23, 9:51 am - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Have a great day.
21/08/23, 9:59 am - +250 791 847 538: Likewise
21/08/23, 3:01 pm - +250 791 847 538: This message was deleted
22/08/23, 8:30 am - +91 78273 08969: Good morning! As we gather for our session today, let's remember Gandhi's words: 'The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.' Let's make this session a meaningful journey of learning and growth
22/08/23, 8:50 am - +250 791 847 538: Good morning there!
22/08/23, 8:52 am - +91 78273 08969: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
22/08/23, 8:52 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 9:13 am - +250 791 847 538: Wow. I've finished to read it.
22/08/23, 9:18 am - +91 78273 08969: Please share your understanding.
22/08/23, 9:56 am - +250 791 847 538: Sorry for late reply I was overwhelmed with the excitement that I finally got an offer letter.

So I love the whole idea of these projects and the fact it builds remarkable qualities of the Edoofians along with professional experience. Also, I am sure that this aligns with expansion of the connections and network!

So far I loved CORPORATE ALLIANCES because it more practical and meets my way of collaboration with others.
22/08/23, 10:05 am - +91 78273 08969: Congratulations on the offer letter.
22/08/23, 10:07 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank you
22/08/23, 10:09 am - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/08/23, 10:09 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 10:13 am - +250 791 847 538: Ok, let me hear!
22/08/23, 10:21 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank you, I've listened carefully.
22/08/23, 10:28 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/08/23, 12:04 pm - +250 791 847 538: I'm rushing to the meeting back and forth; and I really need to offer my full attention to this please if you may excuse me for a bit. 

I'll get back to you with the full description when I come back.

Thank you, Ms. Tenzin!
22/08/23, 12:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Amani.
23/08/23, 8:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
It is time for your session.
23/08/23, 11:19 am - +250 791 847 538: Greetings,  

My apologies for late reply. Lately, I was offline.

From where we left off... I was going explain to you what I have learned.

The objective of this project is to gain the understanding of the market you plan to enter. My task is to identify such companies in my region. One has to have a Linkedin account to help you connect with the employers. Reach out to people in administration regarding their address to plan a call with Edoofa and ask to effectively communicate the alliance. This will enhance the employability and exposure and finding job opportunities within my country.
23/08/23, 11:19 am - +250 791 847 538: Furthermore I already have a LinkedIn account.
23/08/23, 1:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: Amazing, thanks Amani. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
23/08/23, 1:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 8:33 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?
25/08/23, 8:33 am - +250 791 847 538: Hello Ms. Tenzin!
25/08/23, 8:33 am - +250 791 847 538: Good morning,
I'm doing great now, thanks!
25/08/23, 8:34 am - +250 791 847 538: I've been having hectic days recently and as I have mentioned I need to focus on the session without any interruptions.
25/08/23, 8:34 am - +250 791 847 538: I'm ready for the session now!
25/08/23, 8:35 am - +250 791 847 538: I'm surely going to provide you my understanding as well.
25/08/23, 8:36 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?
25/08/23, 8:38 am - +250 791 847 538: I'm fine, thanks!
25/08/23, 8:42 am - +91 78273 08969: Please share your understanding.
25/08/23, 8:50 am - +250 791 847 538: First thing, the nature of the company must be either student related, recreation centric or content centric. The company shouldn't be too small nor too big there has be an optimum range for the company's employees. Therefore this goes along with the company being financially stable of course. There has to be enough knowledge about the founders of these companies and through it all there are sites to be consulted for research.
25/08/23, 8:58 am - +91 78273 08969: You know what Amani, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
25/08/23, 9:00 am - +250 791 847 538: Haha thank you ma'am.
25/08/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
25/08/23, 9:37 am - +250 791 847 538: I thought the 3rd is recreational though

04/09/23, 9:17 am - +250 791 847 538: Community building;

As the word says clearly, community building refers to the process by which individuals initiate a connection between one or two parties to form a network; which leads to a community. 

The goal is to provide a space for positive and productive interactions and improve the idea of responsibility via participation in several ways. 

The primary goal is to develop a networking space and provide a room of opportunity for Edoofians for their future. 
By this, students get to share the experience with others to create an impact.

By that, a student is expected to link with the students who graduated recently, and those are graduating soon. Then, introduce them to Edoofa, and as it is described, a student can get to earn some credits accordingly.

Thank you. I like this project!
04/09/23, 9:21 am - +91 78273 08969: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.

04/09/23, 9:26 am - +91 78273 08969: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

04/09/23, 9:28 am - +91 78273 08969: Amani, Please respond to the information instead of reacting with an emoji.
04/09/23, 9:31 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, I was definitely going to respond.

So, I'm going to provide a list of students that I could talk to. I also discussed with the school administration to give me a space to introduce Edoofa to my fellow students. 

How does that sound?
04/09/23, 9:32 am - +91 78273 08969: That sounds wonderful to me.
04/09/23, 9:32 am - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/09/23, 9:37 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes ma'am!

Please do!
04/09/23, 9:45 am - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
04/09/23, 9:48 am - +250 791 847 538: How would I know the mentor's name? Unless if they get to the point of enrolment, I guess!
04/09/23, 9:48 am - +91 78273 08969: You need to write your mentor's name.
04/09/23, 9:49 am - +91 78273 08969: So the name of the group will be AMANI/TENZIN/ DATE OF MAKING GROUP.
04/09/23, 9:50 am - +250 791 847 538: Ooh that makes sense!
04/09/23, 9:51 am - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
04/09/23, 9:56 am - +250 791 847 538: Wow, this is a great method and very practical.
04/09/23, 10:02 am - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
04/09/23, 10:15 am - +250 791 847 538: That's so perfect... I was wondering you'll be able to follow up.
04/09/23, 10:15 am - +250 791 847 538: That sounds great
04/09/23, 10:16 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 10:16 am - +91 78273 08969: I will be there every step.
04/09/23, 10:24 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes yes yes! I appreciate, that'll be great!
04/09/23, 10:24 am - +250 791 847 538: When do I start ??
04/09/23, 10:25 am - +91 78273 08969: You can start from now.
04/09/23, 10:25 am - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
04/09/23, 10:30 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, understood.
04/09/23, 10:30 am - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/09/23, 11:00 am - +250 791 847 538: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 11:00 am - +250 791 847 538: Well noted ✅️
07/09/23, 12:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is wonderful, Keep me updated.
07/09/23, 1:49 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes ma'am!
07/09/23, 1:50 pm - +91 78273 08969: - Now, Amani- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
08/09/23, 8:22 am - +250 791 847 538: Good morning
08/09/23, 8:38 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?
08/09/23, 8:45 am - +250 791 847 538: I'm very wonderful.
08/09/23, 8:50 am - +91 78273 08969: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
08/09/23, 8:51 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, yes, I'm excited!
08/09/23, 8:51 am - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
08/09/23, 8:57 am - +250 791 847 538: What a wow! This seems to be the best yummy part, after all... I'm amused... please carry on!
08/09/23, 8:57 am - +91 78273 08969: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
08/09/23, 8:59 am - +250 791 847 538: Great topics... please carry on!
08/09/23, 9:00 am - +91 78273 08969: So, Amani, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
08/09/23, 9:04 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, ma'am... I am so committed and willing. Even though I haven't told you much about it yet, I'm a hard-working young person. I guarantee you that you will be impressed and I won't let you down. I'm already grateful for being your mentee.
08/09/23, 9:05 am - +91 78273 08969: I am so happy to hear that.
08/09/23, 9:06 am - +91 78273 08969: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
08/09/23, 9:11 am - +250 791 847 538: Haha OK I have both of them already!
08/09/23, 9:11 am - +250 791 847 538: Let me get them for you real quick.
08/09/23, 9:12 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Amani. That will be wonderful.
08/09/23, 9:12 am - +250 791 847 538: https://www.facebook.com/Amanimusonera

That's Facebook.
08/09/23, 9:13 am - +250 791 847 538: https://instagram.com/amani_dou?igshid=MzMyNGUyNmU2YQ==

That's Instagram. 

But my IG is private... let me know if you want me to turn it public.
08/09/23, 9:14 am - +91 78273 08969: It is okay, I will let you know.
08/09/23, 9:14 am - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- You will have your sessions on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
08/09/23, 9:32 am - +250 791 847 538: Just Monday and Thursday?
08/09/23, 9:32 am - +250 791 847 538: Ok well noted
08/09/23, 9:49 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Amani.
08/09/23, 9:49 am - +91 78273 08969: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
08/09/23, 9:55 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, I recall you mentioned that in the past sessions. 

Noted ma'am!
08/09/23, 9:56 am - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
08/09/23, 9:56 am - +91 78273 08969: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
08/09/23, 9:57 am - +250 791 847 538: You'll be the one still mentoring, though?
08/09/23, 9:58 am - +250 791 847 538: What text should i forward in.
08/09/23, 9:59 am - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/09/23, 9:59 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, I will be your Mentor.
08/09/23, 10:02 am - +250 791 847 538: Ok
08/09/23, 10:07 am - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/09/23, 10:14 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, ma'am. I am a proud Edoofian.
08/09/23, 10:19 am - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
08/09/23, 10:23 am - +250 791 847 538: Absolutely. If I have any concerns, I know exactly where I would address it.  I'm glad I'm in the right hands.
08/09/23, 10:28 am - +91 78273 08969: From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
08/09/23, 10:31 am - +250 791 847 538: Thank ma'am, I'll surely remember. I have to mark the days on my calendar!
08/09/23, 10:34 am - +91 78273 08969: That is wonderful, Have a blessed day.
08/09/23, 10:38 am - +250 791 847 538: Likewise!

07/10/23, 10:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now,Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
07/10/23, 10:40 am - +250 791 847 538: Oh yes, sure...

So I'm Amani, from Kigali, Rwanda 🇷🇼 and today is my birthday 🎂 🥳... yeah! 

So I consider myself a diverse ever since I discovered all my skills and hobbies. I found myself interested in different fields of arts and science. I studied science in high school, did arts as my extracurricular activities, became a poet and content writer, and suddenly I realised I could play some instruments; piano, guitar, and a violin. 

I appreciate diversity so much, and one of my big long goals is to explore the world and learn more about different cultures around the globe. In fact, I speak several languages; Kinyarwanda, English, French, Swahili, and Spanish. So when I say I'm interested in diversity, just know that I mean it.

Furthermore, I am a mental health advocate... for so many reasons and experiences I've been through!

I love reading non-fiction books, and my favourite author is called Malcom Gladwell. He writes a lot of psychology and mindset books. Be alert, that sounds a bit nerdy, but I'm way far from nerdy character, lol.

I watch fantasy movies; my fav shows are Marvel. I'm a big fan of Marvel Studios! 

I could write and write... since writing is one of my primary hobbies, however that's briefly it.
07/10/23, 10:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Amani, you know I was also going through your profile, and I just saw that it;'s your Birthday today!

*Happy Birthday, Amani!*🎉🎂

Although we've just started on this educational journey together, I want you to know that I'm truly excited to be a part of your learning experience. Building a strong student-teacher relationship takes time, and I'm committed to helping you succeed every step of the way.🤝🏽

As we move forward, I promise to provide guidance and support to help you climb the ladder of knowledge and reach your goals. Together, we'll make this educational journey fruitful and enjoyable.🌟

Here's to a fantastic year of learning and growth ahead! 📚🌟🎈 <This message was edited>

12/10/23, 8:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Amani!

I completely understand that yesterday must have been a challenging day for you. I want to explain that an unforeseen medical emergency involving one of our students from your college required our immediate attention. The student was hospitalized, and our Department of Student Welfare was on hand to provide necessary support. It was a medical emergency, and that's why we weren't able to be present at the college yesterday.
12/10/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, I'm equally excited to meet you! But I have an idea! While we work on arranging an in-person meeting, how about we connect over a video call today? I can't wait to catch up with you and address all your questions and concerns.✨
12/10/23, 8:35 am - +250 791 847 538: Good morning,

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that... I hope they get better!
12/10/23, 8:36 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, I would love that indeed. We can arrange a video call shortly!
12/10/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, shall we connect today in the evening?
12/10/23, 8:37 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, yes, that's better!
12/10/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. So let us connect today at 6:30 p.m. Is that alright?
12/10/23, 8:39 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, it's alright, ma'am! Thank you for your time.

13/10/23, 11:49 am - +250 791 847 538: Hello,

These are the new friends that I recommend.
13/10/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have.
13/10/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, you know, while I was recording your student applications, I saw the other student applications you shared with Ms. Tenzin. I learned that one of the students, named Ishimwe Olga, is in the final stages of eligibility.

Do you think it would be very helpful to the student if you could communicate with him or his family about everything here in India? It could significantly assist them in moving closer to the scholarship program. What do you think?
13/10/23, 2:32 pm - +250 791 847 538: That's exactly what was on my mind, I called him 50 minutes ago so that I can talk to his parents and help them have a clear understanding. But unfortunately, I couldn't get to him he was offline. However, I'm still trying his number, and I'll connect with him as soon as I reach him. Also, I'll do the same with his parents; if necessary, I would connect my parents. I am sure it'd be helpful.
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, I must say, you are such a thoughtful person! I really appreciate your efforts.✨
13/10/23, 8:51 pm - +250 791 847 538: Thank you so much, I appreciate it.

16/10/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, these are the pointers we were discussing about :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
16/10/23, 4:28 pm - +250 791 847 538: This session was really intentional, and I learnt a lot as an Edoofian. I'm looking forward to practising the same.

18/10/23, 9:07 am - +250 791 847 538: Greetings, Ms. Ananya!

How are you today? How was your day off yesterday?
18/10/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Amani!

Thank you for asking, it was wonderful.✨
18/10/23, 9:25 am - +250 791 847 538: I am so glad!
18/10/23, 9:33 am - +250 791 847 538: I want to update you on my Internshala status!
18/10/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, do we have some exciting news to share?✨
18/10/23, 9:53 am - +250 791 847 538: Yes, absolutely, ma'am! 

Since I got my Internshala profile verified, I've been receiving tons of invitations from several companies with good stipend amounts and in my field of interest. 

Unfortunately, most of them are jobs, and few of them are interships. 

However, there's an NGO Intership that I applied to, which is unpaid. It lasts for 7 days, and it's about childcare related matters when i will be focusing on social Interpreneur and content writing. So far, I got hired, and I'm attending a Zoom interview at 5 pm today.

20/10/23, 4:15 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes, Ma'am, thank you, I appreciate it!

Also, the professor mentioned something about EWYL. How students with special and extraordinary talents can earn money by teaching their fellow students, or when you have bought something at a low price, you sell it to a higher price... and so forth! She was literally explaining a bit about the EWYL progress in LPU. 

I found it interesting. LPU is a huge field of opportunities indeed.
23/10/23, 5:37 am - +250 791 847 538: Good morning, Ms. Ananya!

I hope you had a wonderful night. Today, I'm officially starting my class sessions, and I'm looking forward to it all.

09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:07 pm - +250 791 847 538: Thank you so much for these six powerful tips for transforming myself into a dream. 

Personally, *Build a Network* tip hits differently, and it rings a bell loudly. Reason being, surrounding yourself with like-minded
individuals uplift you on the
path to greatness, can lead to the discipline to master all mentioned tips at once. 

For instance, having you as my mentor and other people with the same ambition is a very good strategy to transforming myself into a dream achiever.
15/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as promised in our $300 training session,  I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project.

15/11/23, 3:20 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes, ma'am, it took more minutes, I was so curious, and I had to go through it all.
15/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - +250 791 847 538: Well, I think, initially, if these are the applicants we as Edoofians have to find, then it's mostly up to us to know exactly the potential applicants.

For instance, our friends and families who are close to us. We could use the very same method that you proposed about video sharing! 

And also creating groups to pass the information to as well as keeping the strong consistency!

I hope I didn't go off topic from what was actually asked.

27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +250 791 847 538: Greetings ma'am,

Before I proceed with this; let me share my understanding of the previous activity. 

The *Spirit of Competition*

As mentioned in the pdf, it holds power, and it's a driving force leading to innovation and growth. 

Additionally, competition brings energy constant improvement and innovation. It also brings motivation, pushing individuals to perform at their peak, fostering personal development, and inspiring creativity. It also encourages collaboration, as individuals learn from one another and work together toward shared goals. Ultimately, competition brings up resilience and a relentless drive for success, powering progress on both individual and collective levels.

Personally, I take competition from a positive perspective, and from my experience, the spirit of competition helped me discover some parts of my potential that I never knew exited. 

I am a writer, a poet, a debater, and a singer. I've won numerous awards for each and all from competitions. So competition always unlocks different doors to discovering oneself.
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - +250 791 847 538: Ma'am, as from where we left of regarding the training... I would like to remind you that you were explaining to me more after I displayed my understanding regarding the same.

It's wonderful to hear how competition has been a positive force in your life, unlocking doors to discovering your potential as a writer, poet, debater, and singer. Your achievements in winning numerous awards speak volumes about the positive impact of embracing the spirit of competition. Keep harnessing that drive for success and creativity—it's truly inspiring!
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Amani, during our call yesterday, I explained the entire document, and I was expecting you to kindly share a summary of that in reference to this document. This is needed so that I can ensure that you have understood the information clearly and are all set to receive a certificate as a 'Certified Student Leader'.
29/11/23, 7:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈
29/11/23, 11:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Good morning, Amani!*

How's your day going? I wanted to give you an update about the student applications you submitted last month.

1. These students have completed their counseling sessions. However, after completion, neither have they reached out to our counselors, nor are they responding to our counselors' messages.

-*Ishimwe Olga*
-*Arnold Ngaboyisonga*
-*Nijimbere Mechack*

2. Our counselors have been attempting to reach out to these students to begin their counseling sessions. However, neither are these students responding to us.

-*Mutoni Huguetts*
-*David Gatete*

I would recommend you to kindly connect with these students and have a conversation to understand if they are facing any challenges. If yes, encourage them to at least connect with our counselors or share their concerns with you. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 1:10 pm - +250 791 847 538: Good afternoon,

Today has been a long day!

Yes, ma'am, the $300 dollar plan can definitely be achieved. It is my responsibility also to make it happen.

However, I wanted to address an important concern that is mostly showing up. In which I require very intense attention so that I can achieve my goals as anticipated.
29/11/23, 1:14 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes, I am aware, and I've been trying to get in contact with each and every one of them to track their progress.

Also, I'll make sure they reach out to their counsellors for their challenges.
29/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, Amani! Go ahead, I will definitely help you with that.
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - +250 791 847 538: I've previously discussed this concern with Mr. Sahil, but I'd like to revisit it for reconsideration and additional follow-up.

Rwanda seems to have limited connections to the Edoofa Program. As an Edoofian benefiting from incredible opportunities, I feel responsible for sharing stories about this greatness. However, I believe further advertising and support from the Edoofa Team are crucial. Sometimes, I struggle to convey convincing messages due to the community's unfamiliarity with Edoofa.

Therefore, I request further support and more hands to reach out to my community in Rwanda.
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - +250 791 847 538: Ma'am, may I have the link?
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, we will surely have a discussion about this soon, however as of now, I would suggest that we move ahead with our scheduled session as it is a crucial session.
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes ma'am ✨️
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We will have a session here on your EWYL group only.
29/11/23, 2:37 pm - +250 791 847 538: Great!
29/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Let us begin our EWYL Group session_

Start your session off right with these 8 invigorating steps to maximize productivity!

29/11/23, 2:41 pm - +250 791 847 538: Ok, ma'am, I've just gone through them. Wow!!!
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - +250 791 847 538: That's wonderfully remarkable! 👏
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - +250 791 847 538: I'm guessing his response was so shockingly great and unexpected, but please carry on...🥹
29/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amani, try harder!😄
29/11/23, 2:54 pm - +250 791 847 538: Alright, taking a wild guess here; did Raghav reveal that his initial business idea was completely different from what it eventually became successful for? Or perhaps he started with a really small investment that grew exponentially against the odds? The unexpected can be fascinating! What was it that surprised you so much?😂🤌 

I'm very terrible at guessing!
29/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, Amani! Well, I must say you are watching a lot of movies! 😄
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yes, yes, very much so😄
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - +250 791 847 538: Wow! There's no way I could've guessed that. Moreover, we normally tend to think that big connections and resources are the only ways through. That's so impressive, and from what I hear is that, he kept his consistency at the top 👏 👌! I wish the same!
29/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - +250 791 847 538: Yessss! I can do it, too! Thank you so much, I appreciate it.
29/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
29/11/23, 3:17 pm - +250 791 847 538: It's a testament to the power of networking and skill-building. His journey showcases the immense potential of cultivating knowledge-sharing online. Determination, networking, and continuous learning can create incredible opportunities.

14/12/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Amani!

I was waiting for you over the call yesterday; however, you did not attend the call, nor did you inform me about this. Since this is not something you usually do, I want to know if everything is alright?
15/12/23, 2:49 pm - +250 791 847 538: Good evening ma'am,

Recently, I have met some PG challenges, where the electricity has been going on and off... which gives me less time to study, and in the end, I'm filled with tons of assignments and CAs preparations. However, I've gone through the document, and I wasn't able to settle for a pure reflection regarding the same.

Additionally, I'm so close to catching up with everyone so that I don't get left behind even more. I'm spending sleepless nights and more energy towards the cause. Hopefully, something will work out.

Thank you so much for asking!
16/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: "Good afternoon, Amani!

It sounds like you're going through a demanding and stressful time, but it's commendable that you're putting in extra effort to catch up and stay on track. I wish you all the best. 🤝🏽

However, for the next time, I would suggest that you inform me beforehand so that I can help you cover all the important things that we discussed during the call.✨
