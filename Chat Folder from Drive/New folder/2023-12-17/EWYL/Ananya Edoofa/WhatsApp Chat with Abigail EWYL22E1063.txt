11/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

https://youtu.be/-RZ86OB9hw4?si=67Pz56KNwC7OFkEe
11/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 822 5211: Good evening ma'am how are you today
11/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 822 5211: l am a proud EDOOFIAN
11/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 822 5211: from the vedio l understood that Exams are stressful, but stress doesn't have to take over your life.If we understand the science of how it works, we can make it work for us.When faced with a potentially stressful situation,angry parents, driving tests, or, yes, exams,
the danger sensor in our brains, the amygdala, is activated.This alerts the nearby hypothalamus,sending a long-range message via the pituitary gland to the adrenal glands,which secrete the hormones adrenaline and cortisol into our body.
Adrenaline increases our blood flow,speeding up our reflexes and sharpening our senses,and cortisol releases glucose, giving our body vital extra energy.This response, known as fight or flight,
is our body's way of preparing us to tackle big challenges.But when stress levels get too intense,they can trigger negative symptoms,like difficulty focusing, tension headaches, nausea, and disturbed sleep.
The good news is scientists are working hardto figure out how we can keep our stress response balanced and healthy.Some cultures have used slow breathing to aid relaxation for centuries,
and now scientists think they know why.Inhale.Now exhale slowly.When we slowly exhale, the signals that control our heart rate are altered,
making our heart beat more slowly,and a reduced heart rate helps us relax.Another trick is exercise.When we exercise, our bodies release feel-good chemicals
that work in the same way as painkillers do,lifting our mood, reducing anxiety, and helping us to sleep.And sleep is especially important before examsbecause it helps reduce stress even more.Another area that scientists are investigating is socialising.
Believe it or not,locking yourself away in your room for weeks on endis not good exam preparation.When revising, we should make some time to hang out with friends and family,as socialising is a scientifically proven relaxation booster.
Scientists have been looking at our close cousins, chimpanzees, for evidence.When they tested chimps' urine,they found that levels of stress hormones were much lowerwhen they'd been spending time with their chimp friendsthan when they'd been alone.
And it seems the same is true for us.So, as your exams get closer,remember, a little bit of stress is no bad thing.Just follow our simple tips and you can take control,getting the right balance that works for you
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Happy Birthday, Abigail! 🎉🎂

08/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 822 5211: yes ma'am thank you very much
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 822 5211: Everything was clear and understandable ma'am.. l don't have any questions
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you read those sample questions?
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 822 5211: yes ma'am
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 822 5211: yes ma'am thank you very much
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 822 5211: noted, l understand ma'am thank you very much
08/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 822 5211: yes ma'am l understand thank you very much
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 822 5211: The Edoofa scholarship program offers a $300 plan training for Indian Edoofians to enhance their performance and skills in project opportunities. The program focuses on the community building project, which is crucial to the institution's journey. The rewards/credits for the project have been revised and increased to $300, requiring better performance, increased effort, and a better approach. The program aims to build confidence, creative expression, empathy, and presentation skills by empowering Edoofa Certified Student Leaders to select students who are ready for the opportunity.

Eligibility criteria for applicants include reaching out to potential applicants via various channels, informing them about their story and the necessary details about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and answering questions about the scholarship nature, cost of education after the scholarship, the purpose of the EWYL Program, and the involvement of parents/guardians in the admissions process.

Edoofa Certified Student Leaders are responsible for sharing the Edoofa Application form with eligible applicants after evaluating the form and sharing the correct information with the students. The program aims to provide opportunities for Indian students to self-finance their education and contribute to their community.
The Edoofa program offers affordable higher education in India, with a focus on making students employable. The Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is a unique initiative that allows students to work on real-time projects from industry leaders, gain internship opportunities, and attend webinar sessions from African CEOs and business owners. The Department for student welfare is dedicated to assisting students with settling in India and ensuring they excel in the Earn While You Learn Program. The program also provides a 50% scholarship on tuition fees based on academics, merit, extracurriculars, and recommendations from senior Edoofians. The Edoofa program ensures that students are involved and informed about their progress throughout the process, allowing them to improve their skills and expand their network.

The author discusses their decision to explore India for higher education due to its historical similarities with African cultures and its affordable resources. They highlight India's hosting of the G20 summit 2023 and its global influence, with CEOs and directors from leading companies like Google, Microsoft, Channel, Nokia, and IBM being Indian graduates. They also highlight India's vibrant culture, vibrant Bollywood movies, and easy communication in English.
08/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 822 5211: Thank you very much ma'am 🙏
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 822 5211: yes noted ma'am thank you very much
08/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 822 5211: thank you very much ma'am for today.have a great week ahead
08/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 822 5211: Diwali, the festival of lights, is a significant celebration in Indian culture, marked by fervent enthusiasm and vibrant festivities. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, and is associated with the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Diwali holds profound spiritual significance, as it honors Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, signifying the triumph of righteousness and the importance of upholding moral values. It also emphasizes the significance of gratitude and generosity, fostering empathy, kindness, and a sense of interconnectedness within society. Diwali underscores the significance of family and community bonds, encouraging people to come together and strengthen relationships. As the Edoofa student community immerses itself in the festivities of Diwali, they may carry its transformative teachings into their lives and endeavors.
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

25/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023
27/11/23, 6:38 am - +263 77 822 5211: Good morning ma'am how are you today
27/11/23, 6:38 am - +263 77 822 5211: l am a proud EDOOFIAN
27/11/23, 6:38 am - +263 77 822 5211: I define the Spirit of Competition as an attitude and a set of principles that motivate people or groups to pursue excellence, push boundaries, and succeed in a competitive setting. It represents traits like tenacity, fortitude, sportsmanship, and a drive for personal development.

There is competition in many facets of life, including sports, education, business, and personal pursuits. It develops a healthy sense of competition and motivates people to put forth their best effort in order to surpass others. But the Spirit of Competition is more about pushing oneself to overcome obstacles and achieve new heights than it is about outlasting rivals.Fairness, integrity, tenacity, and the desire for both individual and group development are among its core principles. The Spirit of Competition can signify numerous things depending on your particular experiences and views. The concept highlights the healthy and good sides of competition, encouraging growth, skill development, and achievement. But generally speaking, it might represent a person's eagerness to participate in competitive activities, their will to advance and transcend their own limitations, and their dedication to fair play and respect for others. It could also refer to your desire to set and meet objectives, go past roadblocks, and keep pushing oneself to achieve greater things.


Your approach to problems and goals can be significantly influenced by the Spirit of Competition. It has the power to inspire drive and resolve, encouraging you to put up your best effort and pursue greatness. Additionally, it can help you become more resilient by teaching you how to overcome setbacks and failures and see them as chances for personal development rather than insurmountable roadblocks.

Additionally, the Spirit of Competition might influence how you think about working with others and picking up knowledge from them. Although the main goal of competition is to outperform others, there are other benefits as well, such as the opportunity to observe and gain insight from your rivals' advantages and tactics.

In general, the Spirit of Competition may be a strong motivator, encouraging you to push your limits, rise to obstacles, and accomplish your objectives while upholding fairness to others
27/11/23, 11:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Abigail! 🏆🌟

Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!

By understanding the task, identifying the necessary inputs, and crafting a process, students can refine their approach and ensure success. Analyzing the inputs, such as information, data, and personal knowledge, allows for a more efficient and effective method for achieving the desired output. Output evaluation is also essential, allowing for continuous growth and learning from mistakes. Analyzing inputs and outputs extends beyond the classroom, as employers value individuals who can make informed decisions and adapt their approaches based on feedback. By honing analytical skills, students prepare for future challenges and opportunities. The art of analysis is not just a skill, but a mindset that propels success in every endeavor.

13/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 822 5211: College students are navigating a complex world of academics, with responsibilities, expectations, and deadlines. Two virtues that contribute to success are honesty and hard work. Honesty is the cornerstone of integrity, fostering self-awareness, setting realistic goals, and understanding personal limitations. It is essential in academics to avoid plagiarism, citing sources accurately, and submitting work without dishonesty. Honesty also fosters open communication, enhancing personal growth and contributing to the overall learning experience. Hard work, on the other hand, requires dedication, perseverance, and a strong work ethic. It involves setting goals, managing time efficiently, and consistently putting in effort. Hard work also involves continuous learning, developing critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a passion for lifelong learning. By embodying honesty and hard work, college students are not only investing in their education but also cultivating qualities that will serve them well in their future endeavors.
