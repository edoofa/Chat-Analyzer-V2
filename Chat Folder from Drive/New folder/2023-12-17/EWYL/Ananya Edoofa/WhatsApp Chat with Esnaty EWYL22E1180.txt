12/08/23, 11:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 398 7713: Thank you
12/08/23, 12:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
16/08/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 398 7713: Greetings yess
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 398 7713: Yess
16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 398 7713: Okayyy l understand
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 398 7713: Yess
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 398 7713: That's great news
16/08/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 398 7713: That's true
16/08/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

Your profile has come under the close scrutiny of our program director, Ms. Sanjana, and unfortunately, it's raised concerns.

08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Time: *6:00 PM*

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪

17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @919056199480 @263778093424 

I've noticed a consistent delay in your required submissions and attendance at sessions. I want to emphasize that this approach won't help you progress effectively. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress, and at this pace, we won't be able to complete our orientation program on time.

I hope you understand the importance of a dedicated approach. Let's work together to address this and ensure your success in the program.
25/11/23, 8:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Esnaty!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 8:32 am - +91 90561 99480: Sure thanks
25/11/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope that you will now be available.
Cannot wait to see you!🤝🏽
25/11/23, 9:29 am - +91 90561 99480: I cannot wait to see you too mum .....it's been long
25/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 4:35 pm - +91 90561 99480: Im still trying
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
25/11/23, 7:18 pm - +91 90561 99480: Okay sure
26/11/23, 7:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Parents, and Esnaty!

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you tomorrow.

Time: 6:00 PM
26/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 809 3424: Noted with thanks
27/11/23, 10:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Parents, and Esnaty!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move forward with our discussion?
27/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 809 3424: Evening. Yes I am
29/11/23, 7:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈
29/11/23, 1:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Esnaty!@919056199480 @263778093424 

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Let us begin our EWYL Group session_

Start your session off right with these 8 invigorating steps to maximize productivity!

29/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Esnaty, this has happened because of your inconsistency in the sessions. If you want, we can connect tomorrow over a short call so that I can help you reconnect.
29/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 809 3424: Thank you. I think if you can tell her the time so that she will not miss you

02/12/23, 9:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: _*Saturday Activity*_

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

*Deadline: 04/12/2023*
05/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Urgent : New schedule_*🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting tomorrow, we will only connect on Wednesdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.

Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰
06/12/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 4:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you know what? I have an amazing session planned for you along with some targets for this month. However, I am quite disappointed that you did not attend your session. Can I know the reason behind this?
06/12/23, 6:53 pm - +91 90561 99480: Im busy with my CAs
07/12/23, 7:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Esnaty! @919056199480 @263778093424 

I hope you are doing well. I want to bring to your attention that we still haven't completed our grant discussion. Today, I am scheduling our session for the last time.

Time: 5:30 PM

I hope you will be there on time.
07/12/23, 10:00 am - +91 90561 99480: Okay sure
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Esnaty, shall we discuss our grant now?
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - +91 90561 99480: Ok
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $100 annually. 
Do you remember this?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - +91 90561 99480: I remember
07/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - +91 90561 99480: Eish l have forgotten
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
07/12/23, 2:37 pm - +91 90561 99480: Okay okay noted
07/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
07/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - +91 90561 99480: Okay
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
07/12/23, 2:40 pm - +91 90561 99480: Yess
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 10 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October & 4 in November), 8 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October, and 2 in November), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

07/12/23, 2:50 pm - +91 90561 99480: Okay l understand
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Is this clear now?
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +91 90561 99480: Yes it's clear
07/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of Sept, Oct and November you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?

07/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_

07/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Message 9: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

12/12/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

16/12/23, 3:54 pm - +91 90561 99480: Once upon a time, in a  village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a young blacksmith named Aaron. Known for his dedication and honesty, Aaron inherited the family forge and took great pride in his work.

One day, a wealthy merchant approached Aaron with a special request: to craft a magnificent sword worthy of a king. Tempted by the promise of great riches, Aaron eagerly accepted the commission. However, he vowed to forge the sword with utmost integrity and diligence, determined to create a masterpiece that reflected his skill and honor.

For weeks, Aaron toiled ceaselessly at his forge, carefully selecting the finest metals and pouring his heart into every strike of the hammer. His dedication was unwavering, even when faced with challenges that tested his patience.

As the sword took shape, whispers of Aaron's exceptional craftsmanship spread throughout the kingdom. News of the extraordinary blacksmith reached the ears of the king himself, who sent messengers to witness the creation firsthand.

When the sword was finally completed, it gleamed with unparalleled beauty and strength. Its edge was razor-sharp, yet it bore the marks of Aaron's meticulous craftsmanship. The merchant, astonished by the masterpiece, offered Aaron a fortune beyond imagination. However, Aaron, true to his values, declined any excessive reward, content with the satisfaction of creating a work of art.

Impressed by Aaron's integrity and diligence, the king honored him in front of the entire kingdom, recognizing not only the extraordinary sword but also the virtues embodied by the humble blacksmith. From that day on, Aaron's name became synonymous with integrity and diligence, inspiring generations to follow in his footsteps.
