04/08/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 1:58 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ll be in India on Monday in the morning

05/08/23, 11:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zambia where the tuition is *K19000-K2300*0 when calculating the yearly cost including student Amenities: K150+ Medical K200+ Union K150+Maintenance K200+Internet K200+Handbook K200 = K1100, then Hostel and Upkeep= K1000 per month or K12000 per Year. The total Per Year cost comes out to be: K33600 to K40000 which is equivalent to 1850 USD. Talking to seniors, I realized I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zambia.
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this was when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zambia however it is not that easy. I *followed the 5’S* which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
05/08/23, 11:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

I suggest that you connect with them once and understand what has really happened. You can also suggest that they at least connect with the counselors to discuss their career paths.

30/09/23, 1:52 pm - +260 97 2147327: These boys are at a boarding school and phones aren’t allowed there so they’ll be available in November the same way it was for me
30/09/23, 7:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, however, I think their parents can connect, no?
30/09/23, 8:05 pm - +260 97 2147327: Not all of them, most parents are busy that’s why they let the children do the sessions
03/10/23, 7:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:42 pm - +260 97 2147327: I already did my google reviews
04/10/23, 7:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Felix, kindly share the screenshots with me.
04/10/23, 9:14 am - +260 97 2147327: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 11:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: What about the facebook review Felix?
04/10/23, 11:29 am - +260 97 2147327: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 4:23 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright this is okay

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. Let's make this session unforgettable!
18/10/23, 9:28 am - +260 97 2147327: Alright I’ll be there
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I know
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 2147327: Oh okay
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you share any specific ways you think ChatGPT AI might be useful in your studies or future projects based on what we discussed in the last class?
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 2147327: It can be useful for each and every question because AIs can access anything on the internet and have answers to anything
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, this reminds me how's your academics going? Do you have any challenges, or ongoing examinations?
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 2147327: Everything’s just okay thanks for asking but the exams were about tough
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don't worry, Felix! I am sure you will be able to pass your examinations with good scores!💪
18/10/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 2147327: I hope so🙏🏽
25/10/23, 10:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Felix!

I wanted to bring something to your attention regarding Paul Sianyanga. His parent mentioned that you have been telling them about a 100% scholarship to India, which isn't accurate, as we offer 50-100% scholarships based on eligibility and the chosen course. It would be helpful if you could clarify this with the students to ensure they have the correct information.
25/10/23, 10:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Your students named *Zackiel Simpasa, Luzyalo Hankuba's Father, and Dalitso Shekina Chibuyw* have mentioned that they know nothing about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We were just asked to fill out the form. These have also been unresponsive to our counselors messages.
25/10/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I have received feedback from Melissa Musulwe that you have not discussed the cost of education in India. Going forward, you should include information on the cost of education in India, as follows:

India offers 50-100% scholarships depending on your course and eligibility.
The cost of education typically ranges from $2000 to $3000.
25/10/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 2147327: The parents might know nothing because their children didn’t explain to them I explained to them what Edoofa is in their group you even saw that
25/10/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 2147327: You’re in that group you sent me something things to send to them which I did
25/10/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 2147327: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 2147327: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, don't worry! I will look into it. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 5:37 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright and these students left for school before their admission groups were made so maybe that’s why their parents are unaware
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright I’ll be there
28/10/23, 8:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

I hope you remember that, as per our schedule, we have a call today! I can't wait to connect with you because I have some amazing concepts to share and discuss! 🚀

01/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our EWYL session*_

To begin our session today, I have a really interesting video that will make your life easier and more interesting! You are going to love it! 🚀

https://youtu.be/2HfhqzlqLHY?si=ZGBW5lB4gLN6h5Y9
01/11/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay!!
01/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you imagine how you might incorporate this AI tool into your daily routine? Are there any particular ideas or situations that come to mind?
01/11/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve watched it
01/11/23, 2:58 pm - +260 97 2147327: Not really but I feel it can help in improving designing skills
01/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, You know, *Felix*, it has been a while since we introduced the $300 plan to you.  However, our entire team has been analyzing the facts and figures and has come to understand that our students are facing numerous challenges. As your mentor, we have collectively decided to provide you with structured training that will not only help you achieve your goals but also save your valuable time. So are you ready for that?
01/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 7:12 am - +260 97 2147327: Yes I am
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 6:51 pm - +260 97 2147327: Thank you and happy Diwali to you too!
09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 10:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪
15/11/23, 10:18 am - +260 97 2147327: Okay
15/11/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin our EWYL Group session_*

Check out these six powerful tips for transforming yourself into a dream achiever:

15/11/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 2147327: Hello how are you doing?
15/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Felix, why are you late?
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 2147327: I was busy I got home late I haven’t recharged my data
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 2147327: I can find potential applicants from my former school and community through friends
15/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
15/11/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve been trying most of these
15/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
15/11/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright I understand
15/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
15/11/23, 3:59 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay
15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, did you notice the questions?
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I did
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have this step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 2147327: But what if they want to hear the information from you people just like the way it was for us 

Mr Sahil told me everything about Edoofa no one else
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. That's why I asked you to keep track of your conversation. Share the information on WhatsApp so that you can have a record
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - +260 97 2147327: So meaning both me and the counselor should be telling them about Edoofa
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding today's session here.I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
15/11/23, 5:59 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright
22/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Wednesday Wisdom✨_*

22/11/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 2147327: Hello how are you??
22/11/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Felix!

I am doing good, what about you?
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Grant Discussion: Guidelines_*

Let's revisit the time when Mr. Angad visited your country and promised you a Grant. Now that you are approaching your second semester, that time has arrived and therefore, I would like to discuss its eligibility.

I am confident you will excel in this discussion! I have scheduled our meeting for the following:

*Time: 7:00 PM*
*Date: 23/11/2023* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 5:34 am - +260 97 2147327: Alright I’ll be there
23/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’m not understanding the last part
23/11/23, 3:33 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve read it
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I recall the event
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I’m ready
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay and yes that’s very important because the projects aren’t always successful
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 
Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - +260 97 2147327: Thank you for the acknowledgment
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I remember the announcement and I’ll keep aiming high
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

Do you have any questions?
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 5. I am sure you remember that a minimum of 75% attendance is required. We are currently analyzing your attendance and engagement during our sessions and the webinar. If all the requirements are seen to be fulfilled, you will be able to redeem the grant. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 2147327: No I don’t
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly.

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 8:28 am - +260 97 2147327: 8:00PM is okay
25/11/23, 10:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Felix!

I've personally looked into how active you've been in the last two months, and I've found some important details to discuss. These findings are crucial because they'll determine whether you qualify for the Grant.

To discuss this, I've scheduled a session with you today at *6:00 PM* in your EWYL group. I hope to see you there before your call so that we can discuss more during the call. <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 2147327: Alright I’ll be there!
25/11/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 2147327: How are you by the way?

25/11/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 2147327: Anytime
25/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 5:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
25/11/23, 5:43 pm - +260 97 2147327: Today’s the 25th of November so meaning the deadline is 27th
25/11/23, 5:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the same, you can submit it by Monday.
25/11/23, 5:47 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay I’ll do so
27/11/23, 7:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Felix!

Since we couldn't discuss this on Saturday, I have scheduled our session for today at 6:45 PM. Please make sure to be there on time, as I won't be able to reschedule this session again.
27/11/23, 8:27 am - +260 97 2147327: I mostly see my spirit of competition in sports. When I was still in secondary school it helped me and my teammates win the inter class tournament, without that spirit to compete we would have given up after losing our first game. My spirit of competition also played a vital role some weeks ago when we had an inter school sports tournament, I helped my team by getting a couple of assists and goals to reach the semi final.
27/11/23, 11:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!🏆
27/11/23, 11:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program over the call, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project.
27/11/23, 11:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 11:34 am - +260 97 2147327: According to the you said that we should first share our experiences of our journey with Edoofa then after that we start sharing the long content about the Edoofa scholarship program. When we’re done with that we ask the students questions about it as part of the eligibility check.
27/11/23, 11:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! *Congratulations*

Now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆
27/11/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay I’ll do that
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have been observing that you are not even texting me to discuss your grant, why Felix?
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 2147327: I texted in the admission group that I signed the $300 plan
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What about the Grant Discussion Felix?
28/11/23, 2:58 pm - +260 97 2147327: It’s suppose to be in our next session I forgot to ask about it
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 2147327: Thank you for that Ms Ananya🙏🏽
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 2147327: I can never forget that
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 2147327: Ohh okay so meaning I’m above 75%
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Felix, have you tried calculating it? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I’ve tried
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 2147327: Oh no meaning it’s 66.6%
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I’m ready
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - +260 97 2147327: And I only missed one webinar out of the six that were announced
28/11/23, 3:15 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’m sure you have a record

28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I’ve read that message and I only missed one webinar
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: If you are saying, let me check this with Mr Anik.
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay thanks
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I believe that I’m ready
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, I want to share a fact with you that many of you are not realizing, that while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 2147327: So meaning the grant amount can increase based on the sessions?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 2147327: Oh okay so the grant is limited that’s what I wanted to find out cause I remember them mentioning that the grant increases when they visited Zambia
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ll focus on that
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 97 2147327: I have 10 quality forms under the $300 plan???
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I am
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - +260 97 2147327: I can never forget that
28/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 4:06 pm - +260 97 2147327: Ohh I thought that’s what I have done so far
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 2147327: Oh okay but two students told me that they enrolled with Edoofa, Mendai and Imboela 

So meaning if they come here I’ll have $600
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: If a student pays enrollment fees (200$) - You will get 75$
When the student pays the remaining 100$ -  You will get 25$
When a student pays the Registration fee (School fees) - You will get 100$
When a student comes to India - You will get 100$
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 2147327: So meaning for two students it’s $600
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes I remember it very well
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 2147327: I just like calculating everything together after the student finally comes to India
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - +260 97 2147327: Yes
28/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay and how are the responses of the students now??
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 2147327: You haven’t updated me on that
28/11/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will do that by tomorrow!
28/11/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As of now, I am concluding our discussion, and I am hoping for a powerful December where we will work hard and make your parents proud.🤝🏽🏆
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 2147327: Okay
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ll work hard <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 7:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM*

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈

29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Let us begin our EWYL Group session_

Start your session off right with these 8 invigorating steps to maximize productivity!

Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz5oE0Rhexp/?img_index=1
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve checked them
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 2147327: Alright go ahead
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.

In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights.
 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 2147327: He started off with small capital to invest
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:20 pm - +260 97 2147327: So everything begun on LinkedIn
29/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve been building connections I’m now on 500+ connections
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's incredible! For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :

02/12/23, 9:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: _*Saturday Activity*_

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

*Deadline: 04/12/2023*
02/12/23, 1:38 pm - +260 97 2147327: The EWYL projects are going fine at the moment, I’ve been trying hard by working on my community building project since it’s one where you get a chance you interact with friends and other people from your community. There are many challenges that I’ve faced in this project such as people not believing that the program is authentic, students taking time to respond to there Counselors and students acting as if they weren’t told what the Edoofa scholarship program is all about before starting their counseling sessions. I think to improve my results, projects have to be changed or more have to be added because these are too limited and many people are doing the same thing and facing the same problems!
05/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Urgent : New schedule_*🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰
05/12/23, 3:33 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ll see you tomorrow
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

06/12/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 2147327: I think this one’s easy

Isn’t it a keyboard??
06/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end during our session time only; however, since it is over now, we shall continue in our next session.

08/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action  for December accordingly:

1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?
08/12/23, 5:28 pm - +260 97 2147327: Sorry for the late reply I was attending today’s webinar
08/12/23, 5:34 pm - +260 97 2147327: 1.For December I’ll tell the students whose forms I submitted to keep on informing their other friends and family members about the Edoofa program so that I can have time to study and still stay on track with the projects 

2. As I’ve answered for question one I’ve just set a plan aside hopefully it’ll get me a good number of forms

3. For now I think I don’t need any assistance from your end because you have helped me tackle each and every key area the only thing I’m still waiting for is how far my students are going with the process

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL

13/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Also, Final Days of the Grant Challenge – Let's Work Hard Together!!_*

It's the second week of December, and in just a few weeks, you'll be amidst evaluations. I don't want you to look back now! So, tell me:

👉🏼 How will you maintain your performance this month to ensure that you stay in the eligible category?

Ans: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________

👉🏼Do you remember, while discussing the grant, we set a goal to surpass the grant amount because I've always believed that 'Grant amount is limited, but the credits are unlimited.' So, have you made any progress toward achieving our goals?

Ans: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________

You can take your time to answer as we will discuss this tomorrow!

As said last time since I’m starting my exams and I’ll be busy I’ll tell my students to tell their friends about the Edoofa the scholarship and keep me updated about the same.

👉🏼Do you remember, while discussing the grant, we set a goal to surpass the grant amount because I've always believed that 'Grant amount is limited, but the credits are unlimited.' So, have you made any progress toward achieving our goals?

Ans: I’ve been trying to push and make progress and since I haven’t been informed about my credits I don’t know how far I’ve gone.

You can take your time to answer as we will discuss this tomorrow!

15/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Felix ,your main character era starts now!_*

I am delighted to share that one of my students *Shantel Maroza* has successfully surpassed her grant amount of *$200*, and I couldn't be more proud. She has earned *$240* credits in two months. Upon asking her how she could surpass the amount in just a few months, she shared a few tips and tricks with me, and I thought I should share these with you!

✔️She asked her parents to connect with her student's parents to talk about the Edoofa scholarship program.
✔️She highlighted the various opportunities like internships, webinars, and exposure to her students.
✔️She also asked her juniors from the school to add her to the group.

Tell me, what are the steps you are taking to surpass your limited grant amount? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 2147327: I’ve made a group and I’ve been adding people and I also asked my parents connect me with students as well
16/12/23, 1:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Felix!

It's good to hear that. You know, you can also connect with your school juniors to engage with more students, as you being their senior might have a direct and positive impact.

16/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 2147327: I already did that
16/12/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 2147327: And I have a question 

Why is that we can’t use both the grant and the scholarship credits at the same time I didn’t understand the explanation
