07/08/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
07/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 645 5558: Okay ma'am

07/08/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, I talk about LinkedIn, You can type Education in the search bar once you open it.
Not just this, on Google, you can simply type, ‘Small scale Educational companies in African countries
After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.

08/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 645 5558: Okay ma'am
08/08/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/08/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
21/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 645 5558: Okay ma'am I will do so
21/08/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, NAME- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
21/08/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 645 5558: Okay ma'am
21/08/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
21/08/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
21/08/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
21/08/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 645 5558: Yes ma'am
21/08/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
21/08/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 645 5558: Ok ma'am
21/08/23, 9:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
21/08/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 645 5558: Okay great ma'am
21/08/23, 9:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/08/23, 9:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
21/08/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 645 5558: Okay ma'am
21/08/23, 9:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

21/08/23, 9:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here? <This message was edited>

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I am really excited to begin our sessions after your exams. It would be helpful if you could share with me:
*When can we begin with our EWYL Sessions*, _please mention the date_.
25/11/23, 6:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Takunda!

I'm delighted to inform you that we have made another step towards our focus on employability and have effectively organized a *series of webinars* featuring a few  *amazing speakers from Africa*🤩 that our students in India have received the opportunity to attend. 

This effort ensures that our students are provided with abundant opportunities and exposure to enrich their learning experiences.🚀

Our recent webinars have covered *job-ready skills*, 21st-century skills- communication, networking, and more, and key focus topics like *plagiarism awareness and CV building.*
25/11/23, 6:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Guess what?🤔 Four of our Proud Edoofians recently landed paid internships only with their active participation and learning under the dedicated guidance of our *Career Development Officer, Mr. Anik.*💼

Here is a sneak peek of our incredibly informative webinars! 🌟

We cannot wait to hear your thoughts!

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
02/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 234 5931: @918800325457 
Greetings
Hope you are well
02/12/23, 5:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well.
03/12/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 234 5931: Is it possible that we can ask Edofa to wait for Blessing to get her A level results first before you push for the university place. We need to get her results first then we can go ahead and pay for the university.
05/12/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263772345931 

Well, as far as I am aware, every student needs to reserve their scholarship seat before the results. As you know, more than 300 students have already done that, given the limited number of seats available in the universities. However, if you have any doubts regarding this, you can consult with Ms. Kirti in the admissions group.
05/12/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 234 5931: Ok
08/12/23, 5:54 am - +263 77 234 5931: Greetings Ms Anaya I have something to ask you
09/12/23, 5:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263772345931 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. Due to a family emergency, I had to go home, and I was not available.
16/12/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263786455558 @263778592764 @263778592764 

I understand that some challenges prevent you from attending your sessions and responding to my messages. 

However, as your mentor, I want to know what happened. I am concerned about whether everything is alright or not. Kindly share your concerns with me so I can help guide you in the right direction.
16/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 234 5931: We wanted a situation where we can pay everything after we get Blessing results
16/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 234 5931: I mean everything in university seat reservation
