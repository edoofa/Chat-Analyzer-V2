12/08/23, 11:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - +91 91156 96259: Good evening Ms Ananya
16/08/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:36 pm - +91 91156 96259: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 91156 96259: Thank you Ms Ananya for enlightening me on the importance of the Grant. I'm grateful to Edoofa for the chance to earn reward for my hardwork
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - +91 91156 96259: I'm not <This message was edited>
16/08/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - +91 91156 96259: Thank you so much for your kind words, Ms. Ananya. I'm truly honored and grateful for this recognition. I'm committed to upholding the trust you've placed in me and continuing to strive for excellence in the future
16/08/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
19/08/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Lisford!

I'm thrilled to share a fantastic opportunity for earning with you. Would you be available for a call today to delve into the details?

10/10/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 07:00 PM

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

https://youtu.be/2HfhqzlqLHY?si=ZGBW5lB4gLN6h5Y9
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 91156 96259: Good evening
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 91156 96259: Let me watch the vedio
01/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Fantastic! Now, can you imagine how you might incorporate this AI tool into your daily routine? Are there any particular ideas or situations that come to mind?
01/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 91156 96259: I think being a business student I can use it to create a logo for one of my models and also being an Edoofian I can use it to generate one logo that can help attract more students to the community
01/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! As promised and discussed during our call on Saturday, we will begin the training sessions for the *$300 plan today*! Are you ready for this?🚀
01/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 91156 96259: Ready
01/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've read the first step, could you please share the various types of channels from which you believe potential applications can be found?
01/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 91156 96259: Done reading the document
01/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 91156 96259: I believe potential applicants can be found through social media platforms like whatsapp and instagram. Also through direct calls some of the potential applicants can be reached out to. <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's an effective approach! Should I share some more channels?
01/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 91156 96259: Yes please
01/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 91156 96259: Do share
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 91156 96259: Thank you for sharing the channels, I hope to be able to successfully use them in achieving our goal
01/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 91156 96259: Thank you, will make sure to follow the instructions and make sure all the students are well informed
01/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 91156 96259: Sure, I  will double check the information and also try  ensure all is fully understood by the student. You can elaborate on the "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
01/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 91156 96259: Ok, I will frame the questions and share with you. Have a good night.
06/11/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Lisford!

As per your conversation with the DSW team, you were supposed to share a summary for the webinar. May I ask if you were able to do it?
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - +91 91156 96259: Good evening Ms Ananya

I'm confused 
I did have a conversation with them but I didn't know about the summary
08/11/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

27/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 396 8061: Greetings. Noted with thanks
27/11/23, 11:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Also, Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program over the call, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project.
27/11/23, 11:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 12:55 pm - +91 91156 96259: Ok let me write the summary
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Lisford!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move forward with our discussion?
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 91156 96259: Good evening Ms Ananya, we can continue. Can I get 20 minutes though to get home and settle if your timetable is flexible
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure!
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 91156 96259: Settled
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually. 
Do you remember this? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 91156 96259: Yes I do remember
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 91156 96259: I can't remember them exactly as they were but I know they were in line with steps to boost our EWYL gains
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:11 pm - +91 91156 96259: Thank you for the reminder
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 91156 96259: I want to work on making it a sure thing for myself also going forward
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 91156 96259: Noted
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 91156 96259: I see
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you must have realized, that the only thing required here is your engagement with me. Is it that difficult?
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 91156 96259: It's not, I'm ready to work with you to give a positive end result
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 91156 96259: This can work
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 91156 96259: Ready
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 91156 96259: Noted
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.

29/11/23, 2:37 pm - +91 91156 96259: Good evening Ms Ananya
29/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 91156 96259: Wow that's impressive, you can fill me in more. I like taking inspiration from such individuals
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 2:44 pm - +91 91156 96259: Through hardwork and determination 🤔
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Try harder, Lisford!
29/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 91156 96259: Mmm I can't think of the words 😅, 
What I know is that success requires hardwork though
29/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 91156 96259: And working smart
29/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 91156 96259: Wow that's incredible, I'd like to build my career path in the same manner as well
29/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like : 

*Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.
*Job and Internship Opportunities:*
Employers often use LinkedIn to post job and internship opportunities. Students can leverage the platform to find relevant openings and apply directly.
Building a strong LinkedIn profile increases the likelihood of recruiters discovering and reaching out to students for potential opportunities.
*Showcasing Skills and Accomplishments:*
LinkedIn allows students to showcase their academic achievements, skills, and extracurricular activities on a professional platform.
This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.
*Researching Companies and Industries:*
Students can use LinkedIn to research companies and industries they are interested in. Following companies provides updates on their activities, culture, and job openings.
Staying informed about industry trends and company developments is crucial for making informed career decisions.
*Learning from Professionals:*
Following industry leaders and professionals on LinkedIn allows students to stay updated on industry trends, insights, and thought leadership.
Engaging with relevant content can contribute to continuous learning and provide valuable perspectives.
*Building a Personal Brand:*
Crafting a professional LinkedIn profile helps students build a personal brand online.
A well-curated profile, including a professional photo, a compelling headline, and a well-written summary, can make a positive impression on recruiters and potential connections.
*Recommendations and Endorsements:*
LinkedIn allows users to receive recommendations and endorsements from professors, colleagues, or supervisors.
Positive recommendations and endorsements can add credibility to a student's profile and provide evidence of their skills and work ethic.
*Joining Professional Groups:*
LinkedIn offers various professional groups and communities where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on industry news.
Joining these groups can expand a student's network and provide valuable insights into their chosen field.
*Long-term Career Planning:*
LinkedIn is not just for immediate job searches but can also be a tool for long-term career planning. Students can set up job alerts, follow companies for future opportunities, and stay connected with their network even after graduation.

09/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am curious to understand the reason behind your absence from the session today.

It's just that we connect only once a week, and that too late in the evening after all your classes. Even after that, you are not attending your sessions; it's an alarming situation for me and I want to know the reason so that I can help you with that.
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Lisford!

As promised, I am sharing your progress report for November!
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
13/12/23, 1:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday!_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL
