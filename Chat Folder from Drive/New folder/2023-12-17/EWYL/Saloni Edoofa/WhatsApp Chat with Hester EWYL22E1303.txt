Please include:
a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

How are you?
19/10/23, 7:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you understand that it comes from a place of concern when I express my feelings about recent developments. Hester, you're undoubtedly a talented student, and I hold high regard for your abilities. However, in recent weeks, there has been a noticeable shift in our dynamic, and it appears that my efforts and follow-ups have perhaps been taken for granted. I believe we can work together to find a better balance and ensure that your talents continue to shine while fostering a more mutually respectful mentor-student relationship. Your growth and success are essential to me, and I would appreciate your understanding as we navigate this situation together.

How are you?
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263785192635 Hester was given an amazing opportunity a few weeks ago and she was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Hester?
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263785192635

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 9:41 am - +91 83968 62536: Diwali, the festival of lights, is a significant celebration in Indian culture, marked by fervent enthusiasm and vibrant festivities. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil, and is associated with the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Diwali holds profound spiritual significance, as it honors Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, signifying the triumph of righteousness and the importance of upholding moral values. It also emphasizes the significance of gratitude and generosity, fostering empathy, kindness, and a sense of interconnectedness within society. Diwali underscores the significance of family and community bonds, encouraging people to come together and strengthen relationships. As the Edoofa student community immerses itself in the festivities of Diwali, they may carry its transformative teachings into their lives and endeavors.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 83968 62536: We can start
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 83968 62536: Yes l remember
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Hester, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 83968 62536: 75%attendance at school as well as the EWYL sessions 
And its either you redeem your grants or credits the one with the higher amount
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 83968 62536: Ok noted Maam
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 83968 62536: Ok noted
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 83968 62536: Yes l will put efforts
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 83968 62536: Thats a great opportunity
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 83968 62536: Yes l will do so
27/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_

28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Congratulations on successfully submitting the form! Your submission has been promptly shared with our dedicated counseling team. It is of utmost importance that you maintain consistent communication with the student and promptly address any inquiries or concerns they may have during this process. Your proactive engagement will greatly contribute to a smooth and effective resolution.

28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.

Consistency 
Cooperation
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 83968 62536: Yes yes thats true
28/11/23, 3:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.

Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.

Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
