I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

16/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled video call session on Saturday. I shared the call schedule last week, along with the link, on Friday, and I expected your participation. I understand that life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges, and I'd appreciate it if you could kindly share the reason for your absence during the call. Your input is valuable to us, and we want to ensure we address any concerns or issues you might have.
17/10/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: *_Good afternoon Canfred,_*
As the sun rises, so do new opportunities. Embrace this day with enthusiasm, knowing that you have the power to make it amazing. Stay positive, stay focused, and let's make the most of today! 🚀

*Also, a friendly reminder that we have our session scheduled for tomorrow at 6:45 PM*. 📅
I hope you're as excited as I am! Your active participation is highly valued, 

Kindly acknowledge your presence for tomorrow's session. 💬

17/10/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I can understand that you have challenges in maintaining the balance and I truly appreciate how serious you are about your studies and your wish to excel, but these calls are just 10-15 minutes for a weekly check-up and important notifications. I am not asking to spend 2-3 hours weekly connecting ith me but 10-15 minutes in a week. I don't think that is too much to ask for Canfred.
17/10/23, 10:37 am - +91 95011 74383: That is okay maaam
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As our session comes to an end, I want you to know that I'm genuinely grateful for the connection we've shared. Each day is a canvas of emotions, and I hope your day is filled with joy and fulfillment. If ever you find yourself in need of support or just a friendly chat, remember I'm here for you. Wishing you an uplifting day! 🌟💕
20/10/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Canfred!
How are you?
20/10/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, I have tried to schedule multiple calls with you and there has been no response from your end towards the call. I am sure there must be a valid reason with you for missing more than 5 calls that I have been scheduling so far. Canfred in a similar way, I also understand the pressure that you must be receiving from these exams in the initial stage, I have gone through it and I can completely empathize with it. But I just want to at least discuss things and make it easier for both of us in the future. Today, I made sure that as soon as I start my work, I share what I feel about the situation. Please share with me if there is anything. I am genuinely saying it you that I always consider every student my younger brother/sister and like an internal family. Trust me, I will help you out if there is anything even beyond Edoofa. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would appreciate it if we have this call to discuss the same.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Canfred, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

09/12/23, 6:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi
