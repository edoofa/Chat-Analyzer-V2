23/09/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 10:02 am - +27 71 486 9544: Good morning. Sorry for not responding in time. Iam currently at work and will respond to some of the issues after 12.

May I respond to some of the issues late
23/09/23, 10:22 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Which is why we are asking if you can attend on behave.
23/09/23, 11:53 am - +27 71 486 9544: I long suggested in May and i can even send you the response given to this request
23/09/23, 11:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, could you choose one slot?
23/09/23, 12:03 pm - +27 71 486 9544: Unfortunately non of the sessions indicated will suit both me and my wife. Our working ours are 7am- 5pm Monday. Friday and 7am- 3pm Saturday
23/09/23, 12:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will get back to you on Monday and see what we can do.
23/09/23, 12:19 pm - +27 71 486 9544: Ok
We could have completed the sessions way back in May or June if our request as parents for doing it on her behalf was considered
23/09/23, 12:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, I am sorry for the same.
23/09/23, 12:24 pm - +27 71 486 9544: It's okay
29/09/23, 10:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Anotida,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for today's session?🚀
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Yes
01/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Can you share what you've retained till now from your EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
01/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 575 2245: EWYL is a program that help students pay their funds .it is a program that awards students according to the hard work they perform
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 575 2245: It helps to reduce fees by earning scholarship credits.
01/12/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Ok
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Yes
01/12/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

01/12/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
08/12/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Noted
08/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *-A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ANOTIDA/ADITI*
08/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
08/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

noted
08/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Ok
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
