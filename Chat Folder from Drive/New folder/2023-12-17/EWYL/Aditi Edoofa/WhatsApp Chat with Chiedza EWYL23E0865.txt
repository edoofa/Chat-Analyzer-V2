As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (15-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*

I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.

Thanks for asking. <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 5:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that you're feeling inspired.
16/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 779 0133: Yes I am
16/12/23, 6:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Furthermore, I apologize for the delayed response as I was on leave due to health reasons.

So we will commence our session Monday onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
