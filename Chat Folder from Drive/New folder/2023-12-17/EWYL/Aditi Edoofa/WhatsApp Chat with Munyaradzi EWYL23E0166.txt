Great work.
16/08/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Keep it up Munyaradzi!💯
17/08/23, 8:26 am - +263 71 358 4073: Good morning Ma'am
17/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 358 4073: Yes 🥰. Let's begin Ma'am
17/08/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
17/08/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Munyaradzi, we were discussing about the African Schools Reform Project, so may I know if you were able to connect with other school heads?
17/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 358 4073: I couldn't connect with any . It seems that almost all schools in my area are connected with Edoofa.
17/08/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you could try for a different area, right?
17/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 358 4073: Yes , I'm thinking of approaching schools in another areas.
17/08/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
17/08/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
17/08/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
17/08/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 358 4073: Okay. I get it.
17/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

17/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 358 4073: Wow 🙃 ! It's a good message for approaching school heads.
17/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes.
17/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.
17/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
17/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

17/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
17/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

17/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 358 4073: Okay 👌. Noted.
17/08/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
17/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 358 4073: Duly noted 🙃
17/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
17/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 358 4073: I get it Ma'am

21/08/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 358 4073: Good 😊 morning 🌞 Ms Aditi
21/08/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let's begin.
21/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
21/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 358 4073: Yeah ☺️. We can begin
21/08/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great
21/08/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
21/08/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
21/08/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 358 4073: Yes !
21/08/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
21/08/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
21/08/23, 8:37 am - +263 71 358 4073: Well 😊
21/08/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
21/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 358 4073: Yes , Ma'am
21/08/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Can you please share your understanding of these terms?
21/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 358 4073: Absolutely, I'll be happy to share my understanding of these terms with you. 😄 Let's start with research. Research is the process of gathering and analyzing information to find solutions or answers to questions. This can be done through reading, interviewing, surveys, or other methods. Content writing is the process of creating written material, such as articles, blog posts, or social media content. Digital marketing is the use of digital technologies to promote products or services.
21/08/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Very nice, go ahead.
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 358 4073: And I think SEO is the process of optimizing a website for search engines like Google. The goal of SEO is to get a website to rank higher in search results for relevant keywords, which can lead to more website traffic and conversions. There are many different techniques that can be used for SEO, including optimizing titles and meta descriptions, creating keyword-rich content, building backlinks, and optimizing for mobile.😑
21/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, yes that is correct.
21/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 358 4073: 😊 thank you
21/08/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 358 4073: I do as you say Ma'am. I won't disappoint you 😊.
21/08/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that would be appreciated.
21/08/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours
21/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 358 4073: Okay 👍. I will send it to you
21/08/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: That would be great.

21/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: You look great, Munyaradzi.
21/08/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 358 4073: Thank you 😊
21/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 358 4073: Let's do it on Tuesday and Friday
21/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 358 4073: Okay.
21/08/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 358 4073: Ok 👍. Duly noted.
21/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/08/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session will be on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
21/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 358 4073: I get it. Thank you 😊

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

Hope you are well.

I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family and friends!*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
