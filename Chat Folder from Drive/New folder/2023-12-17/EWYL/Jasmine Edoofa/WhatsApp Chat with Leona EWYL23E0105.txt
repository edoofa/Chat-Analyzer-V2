You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off. 🌟

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Kindly take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our sessions, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

15/08/23, 1:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️
15/08/23, 1:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do let me know how you have celebrated the day ☺️
17/08/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @27737503488 @27786584246 @27784162843 
I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:12 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We will have signed the letter by  Wednesday.

 They are currently at work but they were very proud when they received the news!
17/08/23, 3:13 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We appreciate the grant
17/08/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Leona, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - +27 78 658 4246: I understand
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - +27 78 658 4246: If I may ask: I paid my fees through Edoofa but it has not been updated at the financial office so my attendance is blocked currently and I have 0% attendance but have been attending all lessons.

How can I handle that to ensure that my grant/scholarship credit is not revoked due to a low attendance percentage.
17/08/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: If you have paid your fees then it will be updated.
Also as soon as you inform me about your situation then your Grant won't be revoked.
17/08/23, 3:34 pm - +27 78 658 4246: We paid last week but Mr Mukund has not yet sent the proof of payment to the school to update them on the fee payment so my attendance is still blocked
17/08/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me look into this.
17/08/23, 3:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have informed Mr. Mukund and I will get back to you when I will get the update.
17/08/23, 3:41 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Thank you very much for your assistance Ms. Jasmine. I appreciate it.
17/08/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
17/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Thank you very much Ms. Jasmine. I will continue to show my dedication throughout the journey. I appreciate your guidance!
17/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 658 4246: Before we end the session I wanted to share Application forms with you.
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Leona, I would suggest you wait for a day. I want to take a call with you beforehand and then you can submit the forms.
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - +27 73 750 3488: I really sppreciate the EDOOFA family and cmmumity in all the efforts to better my daughter"s promising future goals. I salute your cause!
17/08/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very touched by your kind words.

25/11/23, 1:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India.

28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.

2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

14/12/23, 12:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Leona,*

I trust you're doing well. It was disheartening not to see you on the call yesterday. I want to emphasize that our meetings occur just once a week, and yesterday's call was scheduled for only 30 minutes. I believe it's reasonable to allocate at least 30 minutes from your week.
Moreover, I've noticed your absence from several recent sessions, and it's raising concerns about your commitment to the EWYL Program and earning credits. 

Do you want me to assume that you may not be as serious about it?
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 🚀 *Exciting Update Alert: 15 Days In, 15 to Go!* 🚀

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only 15 days left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁✨

Let me spill some tea – one of our rockstar students flipped his eligibility from "not eligible" to "grant-ready" last month! How, you ask? By showing up to every call, putting in his 100% on projects, and making it happen. 🌟
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I get it, exams are breathing down your necks, but fear not! Our meetings maybe once a week, but let's make every second count. 🕰️

*To keep the momentum rolling, I want you to set a target to submit at least one application for a $300 plan by Monday!* 🚀💸
