I hope you all are in great health and spirits. Since you were not able to attend/complete the last Grant Session, I have scheduled one other session for the Grant discussion. 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 24-08-2023 at -
_*2:30 pm (Zimb time) / 6:00 pm (Indian Time)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want you to read the Grant Letter that was shared with me along with the FAQ document. Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
*No more sessions will be held after this.*
24/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Okay thank you very much.I will be available
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 294 2467: I understood that the Grant price comes with it's own rules and regulations. Inorder to keep the acquired Grant one must adhere to certain rules and challenges
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Sorry regulations
24/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 294 2467: An EDOOFIAN should ne able to follow those rules as it shows a certain level of dedication
24/08/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Yess I'm ready
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 294 2467: It also puts students in a position to challenge themselves and do their best in everything they do
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Yes I'm very much aware
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Thank you very much. I'll work very hard in the future too
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 294 2467: Thank you very much. I feel motivated
24/08/23, 2:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win. <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 294 2467: They were more than happy and even more excited for this Grant challenge. For now they're a bit busy that's why they are not online. But I'm sure as soon as they are online they will reply. I will submit the form soon
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 294 2467: I understand all the rules and regulations that vome with the Edoofa Grant
24/08/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

01/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I didn't know the time for our session. I got caught up at the bank trying to open an account. If possible may we please have the session tommorow
08/11/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Tariro*

I hope you're doing well. I realize that it's been some time since we last communicated. We've been on the road, visiting various partner universities for the initial orientation event.

Now that we've completed our visits to nearly all the universities, I'm back in touch with you. Tariro, I trust you recall the discussion you had with *Mr. Sagar*, which has hopefully provided you with more clarity.

I want to bring to your attention that a significant amount of time has passed since the video submission deadline. Please ensure that you complete this task by the end of today.
08/11/23, 1:31 pm - +91 78892 32272: Greetings to you too Ms Jasmine. Hope you are doing well. Okay I will submit the video
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Evening Tariro*_
I hope you're doing wonderfully. It's time to kickstart our journey back into the world of Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday Activities. 🚀 Today, being Wednesday, I've got a golden nugget of wisdom to share, and I'm super excited to hear your thoughts on it. 🤓💬 

*Kindly dive into the content below and share your insights right here in the EWYL GROUP by tomorrow.*
Happy reading! 📚😄👍
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm also very excited. I had missed all the lessons and knowledge that I get from the Wednesday wisdom
08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: I have understood that Diwali marks the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. It is observed on the new moon night. It encourages individuals to cultivate knowledge and wisdom. Lighting of the dayas helps in enlightening souls and also thus urging spiritual growth. Here this side there are lights all over. This is very exciting as I have been looking forward to Diwali. I'll also get a chance to experience the same feeling.
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: Happy Diwali to you Ms Jasmine🫂❤️
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - +91 78892 32272: I had a wonderful session with Mr Saga and I am looking forward to more exciting sessions with him. Thank you very much Ms Jasmine for always mentoring me and being there for me. I will always work hard and do my best for my EWYL

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.
*How was your first Diwali here in India Tariro?*
14/11/23, 9:44 am - +91 78892 32272: It was okay. Though I didn't have a chance to participate in any of the activities, I enjoyed. How was yours?. Hope you also enjoyed
14/11/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: My Diwali was vibrant and full of colors. We adorned our home, created beautiful rangoli designs, and indulged in a variety of delicious sweets.
14/11/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Why didn't you participate in any activities Tariro?
14/11/23, 10:04 am - +91 78892 32272: Most India students went back to their homes and even the teachers and staff members. So only a few people were left. I couldn't even understand what they were doing at times. But i loved the lighting and fireworks though
14/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I wanted to bring to your attention that we couldn't meet this past Saturday due to Diwali preparations. To catch up, I was hoping we could schedule a *video call today at 6:30 pm.* Does that time work for you?

*Here is the call link* 📲
https://meet.google.com/ipu-ubhn-gzz
Make sure you are on time. ⌚
14/11/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so happy to see that you have learned so much Tariro
14/11/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes definitely❤️
14/11/23, 10:56 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the update. I will attend on time
15/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tariro, 
I hope you are in great spirits. 

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪
15/11/23, 9:51 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the reminder. I'll be available for the session
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Evening Tariro,_*
How are you doing?

It's time for the session
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78892 32272: Greetings mam. I'm sorry I'm late for the session. Can you please add me
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78892 32272: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, we have a session here in the group.
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 78892 32272: I thought we were having a group call
15/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78892 32272: I hope you had a great day today
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Quick flashback to our chat yesterday about the training document. Were you able to go through the document?
15/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes i went through the document. And basing on the information after training, the student should only be able to aim and focus more with students who are well focused and have potential. You should choose someone who has interest or will not dissapoint later on.
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You know the purpose of conducting this training holds great significance. I am confident that you understand the importance of this plan. Training is a crucial step to ensure that you can derive the maximum benefits from it. Upon completing the training, you will be recognized as a student leader, and you will be responsible for your own application forms.

Does that make sense to you?
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes it does. One should be able to recognise potential in other students or even mould others until they understand the importance of certain things in life
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now let's delve into what your specific responsibilities will be as a *STUDENT LEADER* once the training has been completed.

▪️ Step 1: Contact and reach out to the prospective students.
▪️ Step 2: Educate them about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
▪️ Step 3: Ask them some questions to see if they qualify.
▪️ Step 4: If they qualify, share the Offline Application form with them.
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the enlightenment
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 78892 32272: So one has to be sure about what he or she does because as a student leader every action you make matters
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You can start working on this after the session and make sure you submit the questions by tomorrow.
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes it's clear thank you
15/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 78892 32272: How many questions do l have to make
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 5 Tariro
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay I'll definitely work on the questions
15/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 78892 32272: I think you should highlight on what exactly is Edoofa. And the benefits of Edoofa. I think the fact that I'm also a beneficiary and that I'm already in India can also be an advantage to convince students. Most importantly you should emphasize that it is not a fully funded scholarship but can be according to the merits you earn and how good you are.
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: ▪️Start by introducing yourself, and providing your own introduction.

▪️After the introduction, explain the Edoofa Scholarship program.

▪️Describe the application process for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

▪️Highlight the reasons for choosing Edoofa over other organizations.

▪️Emphasize what makes the Edoofa Scholarship Program unique.

▪️Discuss why India is considered a dream destination for education.
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for enlightening me more
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm sorry for the response. I was facing some network challenges
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's regrettable that we couldn't finish our session today. We'll reconvene next week for our group call to resume the training.

Wishing you a good night and looking forward to our session next week.
Take care!
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you very much. Same to you
17/11/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Greetings, Tariro*_

In this lesson, we will explore how embracing a competitive mindset can be a driving force behind personal and collective achievements. We'll examine real-world examples that showcase the transformative impact of competitive spirit on innovation, resilience, and overall success.

Understanding the dynamics of competition is crucial in today's rapidly evolving world, whether you're navigating your academic journey, planning your career, or considering the broader societal landscape. This lesson aims to provide valuable insights and inspiration as we explore the stories of individuals, businesses, and nations that have thrived by fostering a competitive edge.

Come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions, share your perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of how the power of competitive spirit can shape our paths to success in our upcoming session.

I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

*Date: 23/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM*
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay thank you for the reminder. I'll be available for the session
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Evening Tariro!*_🌸
I hope you are doing well. 

Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 2:32 pm - +91 78892 32272: Good evening to you too. Yes I'm very much prepared for the discussion
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were *awarded a grant of $300 annually.* 
Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes i remember
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 78892 32272: I still remember some of the guidlines
23/11/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share it with me
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay. It stated that the grant can be cancelled anytime if i do not follow the given guidelines. One has to dedicate 75% of her time to school work. Always attend classes and maintain 75% attendance. Student has to have a valid reason if he or she wants to skip classes
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me elaborate
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank for the reminder and enlightenment
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 78892 32272: So am l allowed to redeem the whole amount of the grant in one  semester
23/11/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. This is a annual grant. 
You can't redeem the entire at one time
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 78892 32272: I mean can i redeem $300 all at once in 1 semester
23/11/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Tariro
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay thank you. I understand
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 

The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay I understand thank you. I also wish and hope for the best
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes I'm very much aware of that
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Considering a total of 6 sessions with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

23/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 78892 32272: What does the "attendance" stand for
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 78892 32272: Is it for the sesstions i attended at school in the office with Mr Saga or Mr Rithvik
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 78892 32272: I have attended almost all of the webners. I only skipped 1. I think i have the screenshots let me check
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, those and session with me also
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Attendance for the webinar is recorded based on the allocated time associated with the ID used for registration. We've established a specific time threshold; attendance is marked only if the student participates up to that designated time. This ensures accurate tracking and verification of attendance, promoting fairness and consistency in the process. If a student attends the webinar beyond this designated period, their attendance will be recorded.
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay  i understand
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program - to become job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors & industrial exposure - webinars) plus earning scholarship credits (via working on the projects).
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.
23/11/23, 5:01 pm - +91 78892 32272: I will definitely do my best to attend all the sessions and activities so as to surpass the Grant amount and earn more scholarship credits

24/11/23, 2:30 pm - +91 78892 32272: Good evening to you. I hope you are well
24/11/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening Tariro
How are you doing?
24/11/23, 2:34 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'm good thank you. Just that we have ongoing examinations
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you exams going?
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78892 32272: Not bad but it's hard though
24/11/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I know you will do well. I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes I'm very excited
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you remember yesterday's conversation.
24/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes i remember. It was about  performance and eligibility and also how i can be able to qualify to redeem the Edoofa grant
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes I'm ready. I'm ready to do my best. I know that i can do better than what i did
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Tariro. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $900 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now is $13.20. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
24/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 78892 32272: I will work hard to increase my credits. So that I'll cover up part of the fees
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
24/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes I'm ready to make up for the opportunity that i have lost
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes definately. What is the plan about
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 78892 32272: So by end of December i should have achieved this
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Tariro
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
24/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay i understand. I always have to be ahead of everything and also make sure to attend all sessions on time

📍*Time:* 6:30 pm to 7:00 pm
25/11/23, 10:54 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the reminder
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We are about to start our call in 5 minutes. Make sure you join on time.

📍*Video call link:* https://meet.google.com/vxm-hgdd-cpm
25/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 78892 32272: Thank you for the reminder
25/11/23, 3:45 pm - +91 78892 32272: Spirit of competition leads an individual to performing their personal best hence creating a hunger for success. My educational journey was more complicated when i was in high school. Because all my friends were best performers so i had to do my very best inorder to keep up with them. I didn't want to be left out. Therefore in the end there was a competition between us as friends. I believe that it was one of the reasons why I got good grades in school. There competition leads people to doing their very best. It pushes everyone to the edge. So i believe that the spirit of competition is necessary in people's lives.
27/11/23, 11:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tariro

29/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 78892 32272: Yes it's clear. I understand
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's delve into the discussion about a platform truly rooted in the 21st century—a space cherished by professionals worldwide. Yep, I'm talking about *LinkedIn*

29/11/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sure you must have heard about it. Could you kindly share what comes to mind when you think about LinkedIn? What's your take on this professional playground?

29/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: It also informs others about new job opportunities

01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +91 78892 32272: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine. I hope you are well
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +91 78892 32272: Analysing is when you study or examine the tasks that you have in hand. For example as a students you must analyse all your tasks or daily activities and know what matters the most. One should prioritize things that matter the most other activities should follow after that. After knowing what is most important, one should know the effects of investing their time in that particular activity. Work hard so as to achieve maximun output from it.

Research more about that certain tasks. If possible ask for more information from people who have went down that path or faced the same situation. At times one learns the most from other people's experiences and mistakes. Be sure about what you're doing.  However failure is also part of life. Embrace all your failures and learn the most from them. This helps you to do better and not make the same mistakes again.

Make a plan on how you are going to achieve the most from that certain task or plan. So you know the direction which you are following. That way you always know which stage you went wrong and improve it. Analysing is important as it brings a sense of directions either ib a task or an activity. You always know what you are doing and an estimates of the outputs from that activity

Once you are done, do let me know and then we will start.
06/12/23, 3:30 pm - +91 78892 32272: Good evening to you too. How was your day
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I had a very peaceful day, Tariro
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +91 78892 32272: I have checked the post and left a comment there
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In this session, I would like to discuss the following:

▪️Training Document for $300 Plan: Confirm understanding of the training document for the $300 plan.
▪️Challenges with $300 Plan Students: Discuss any challenges encountered in communication with students under the $300 plan.
▪️December Scholarship Credit Target: Share your target for scholarship credits in December.
▪️Weekly Form Submission Goal: Specify the number of forms you aim to bring in weekly until the end of December.
06/12/23, 3:36 pm - +91 78892 32272: Okay I'm well prepared and ready for the session
06/12/23, 3:43 pm - +91 78892 32272: I have understood that for  the $300 plan students have to think outside the box and be able to improve their selection skills. It's not just about choosing but about critically analysing their choice of students. For this some focus is required. One has to make sure that the selected students understand what Edoofa is about and do some regular follow ups on those students. And make sure that you reach your goals.
06/12/23, 3:45 pm - +91 78892 32272: Currently the main challenge is that most students are not really sure about what they really want. They have not yet made a decision about where they want to study so most of them are still thinking about it.
06/12/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78892 32272: By December my main target is earning at least 30 to 40 credits
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - +91 78892 32272: For the weekly forms, are all the applications that i submit from now on considered to be part of the $300 plan
06/12/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Tariro
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - +91 78892 32272: For application letters i think  at least 2 or more per week
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So have you created your WhatsApp group?
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78892 32272: No not yet
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78892 32272: I'll creat it today
06/12/23, 3:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Tariro. May I know that how are you doing to reach out to the students?

09/12/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?
09/12/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 8:59 am - +91 78892 32272: Thank you very much. This really means a lot
09/12/23, 9:04 am - +91 78892 32272: For December, my main aim is earning at least $30 to 40 scholarship credits. I also aim to submit at least 10 application forms by the end of December
09/12/23, 9:09 am - +91 78892 32272: After reflecting on my performance I have realised that I needed more dedication in my school work especially in my webners. I now aim in making the best output from every possible situation
09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

13/12/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

13/12/23, 2:32 pm - +91 78892 32272: Honesty is important as it leads to better decision making. Honesty allows one to evaluate situations objectively and make choices that align with our values and goals. Hence being the cornerstone of integrity.
One must be honest with everything they do nomatter the situation. This involves avoiding plagarism and also being punctual. 
Hardworking is a trait that every student should possess. One should be more dedicated in everything they do and make sure that they do their best. Hard work and success work hand in hand together. Hardwork does not lead to disappointments. One must have passion with whatever they are doing. Loyalty and hardwork leads to well disciplined students. Students will always be determined to outshine themselves and think outside the box and do better than anyone else can.
