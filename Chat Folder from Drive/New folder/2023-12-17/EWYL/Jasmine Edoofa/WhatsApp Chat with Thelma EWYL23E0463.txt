08/08/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey
1. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
08/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 138 1984: I understand ma'am
08/08/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

10/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 138 1984: Yes
10/08/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
10/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 138 1984: I liked the first one where Nkosilomusa was talking about having empathy when solving problems . I have realised that this could help someone become a successful leader as the person before passing a judgement, he puts himself in the shoes of that particular person.
10/08/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I agree,  am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

10/08/23, 8:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
10/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 138 1984: Noted ma'am and  thank for considering me.

10/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 138 1984: I am eager to meet you in person too.
10/08/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Thelma, May I know that are you occupied somewhere?
10/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 138 1984: No l am not
10/08/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* here on the EWYL Group
10/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 138 1984: Noted ma'am
10/08/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I will tell you why? 
Imagine that you are a wizard, and you possess a magical spell that can transform your life and empower you to achieve your dreams. This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
10/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 138 1984: So l can say this words anytime?
10/08/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and support each other on your journey to success.
So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
25/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 138 1984: Noted ma'am. Thank you for updating me.
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Thelma!
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 138 1984: I have listened to the audio
25/08/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
25/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 138 1984: The community building refers to the strengthening connections within a specific group. It also creates an environment where everyone has a sense of belonging. The main objective of the project is for students to develop networking skills.  I am to seek out motivated youths who are seeking to build successful careers. The project also encourages students to adopt a mindset of sharing opportunities which will make a positive impact in their lives.
25/08/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As we conclude our session, I want to remind you that our next meeting awaits us on *Monday at 8:30 a.m*.

Happy Weekend!
29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

17/09/23, 4:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
17/09/23, 4:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
17/09/23, 4:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/09/23, 5:06 pm - +91 92891 56983: One can create a WhatsApp group where right students will be identified and added to the group. This method is efficient as it can reach out to a number of students with one go. Students who are currently in A level or who have finished can be added to that group. One can start with a catchy line as it will attract more people.
17/09/23, 5:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Thelma, I am impressed with your understanding.
17/09/23, 5:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
17/09/23, 5:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
18/09/23, 2:43 pm - +91 92891 56983: Q1. Thekwane High School. No it is not connected with edoofa.

Q2. Greetings sir. My name is Thelma a former student at Thekwane high school who obtained 22 points. Currently l am fulfilling my dreams at Lovely professional university in India, one of the globally recognised university. I wanted to let you know that some of the Thekwane students can too fulfil their dreams in India through a scholarship called edoofa which can offer 50-100% scholarship. This scholarship can make the students to attain quality education at an affordable price.

Q3. Matebeleland South
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - +91 92891 56983: Yes l agree
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 92891 56983: Noted ma’am
18/09/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
18/09/23, 3:15 pm - +91 92891 56983: Yes l am ready
18/09/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.

Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,

13/12/23, 1:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
