11/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Noted ma'am
11/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Registration process is when l receive offer letters from  universities which also contain the scholarship percentage depending on their grades. It involves finalizing ones enrollment fee into the Edoofa program by completing enrollment fee formalities. Once the student pays registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the Admission acceptance letter which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian high commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa
11/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
11/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 321 0548: No inquiries ma'am
11/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 321 0548: * queries
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, I am ready
11/10/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*. May I know if you are ready?
11/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, I am ready
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am😂
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Noted ma'am
11/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, following
11/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, I have understood
11/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Following
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Understood
11/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Ma'am, is it possible to pay the money back home?
11/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Noted, I was about to ask
11/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Noted ma'am, thank you for the enlightment
11/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sorry, I did not understand your question well here, could you please help me understand your query better?
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 321 0548: I wanted to ask if it was possible to pay that amount back home, but I am answered
11/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are clear now. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 321 0548: No ma'am, I understand
11/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 321 0548: I won't let you down ma'am
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure of that Crystal. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 321 0548: I have reviewed them ma'am, they are quite good
11/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of The student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Crystal, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 321 0548: That is amazing
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 321 0548: It does ma'am, and it's great
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 321 0548: No ma'am I understand
11/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Please, provide more information ma'am
11/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion ahead however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm.

12/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, we understand that these processes can sometimes take time. Crystal can take the necessary time to process her documents and retrieve her transcript and certificate from her former school. Can I anticipate that she will be able to collect the document by tomorrow 12:30 pm?
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 321 0548: I'm  not so sure.We're trying to engage the authorities if they can send a copy of the certificate on my phone.The school is a bit far from our town.

13/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
13/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 321 0548: So how many points should you have to contain a full scholarship, or even 50% scholarship
13/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels like a good 14-16 points will be an excellent merit, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
13/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am
13/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Understood
13/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 321 0548: No ma'am,, everything is clear
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Crystal's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that crystal is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, we are truly excited
13/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Hopefully she gets a good University
13/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263773210548 With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
13/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Noted ma'am
13/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 321 0548: A a good night
13/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Have
13/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you and have a great night to you too.
15/10/23, 7:52 am - +263 77 321 0548: Greetings ma'am
16/10/23, 7:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Crystal.

17/10/23, 11:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Crystal,

We are just as thrilled and excited about the journey ahead. Also, thank you for sharing the update regarding your exams. We wish you all the best, and I am certain you will perform well.
18/10/23, 8:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the importance of focusing on your exams and the priority of the offer letter, what we can do is, if your parents are available, we can connect with them today to discuss the offer letter right here in your admission group.
18/10/23, 8:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Then, whenever you find some time in your schedule, you can go through the discussion we had, understand the letter better, and catch up with us. This way, you won't be left behind, and you will be in a position to share your thoughts and ask any questions you might have. We can then reconnect on Friday/Saturday to ensure we are all on the same page. What are your thoughts on this solution?

18/10/23, 8:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this Ma'am and I can understand the work commitments you have in place. However, at 01:00 PM, I have a meeting scheduled with the admissions team and that would restrict my ability to have a smooth discussion with you. 

To ensure we can discuss the offer letter well and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if you as parents will be available to connect with us today in the evening at 07:30 PM? 

This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete Crystal's admission formalities.
18/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 321 0548: Ooh yes, that would be fine.At least every one of us will be free then.Thank you and have a great day
18/10/23, 8:36 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That sounds great, @263773210548. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the evening at 7:30 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion and will be fully prepared to assist you.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Following ma'am
18/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we move forward today, we will delve into the specifics of this particular offer letter. I will provide you with detailed information about the admission process, explain how it was conducted, and guide you through the steps required to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of questions on your mind will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Sorry my network is bad today but I think the approach you've mentioned is fine
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand the network challenge and that is absolutely alright. Now that we are all set to discuss Crystal's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Crystal's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 321 0548: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 321 0548: 3Admission and procedure cost is $300
4.Registration fee is $750
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in Crystal's offer letter, her course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling ten semesters for his degree. 

With the scholarship offered, her tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means her annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
19/10/23, 4:54 am - +263 77 321 0548: We will try our best
19/10/23, 8:49 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am certain of that @263773210548 and I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
19/10/23, 8:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
19/10/23, 8:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Crystal can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- She will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist her in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Crystal as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 321 0548: The off campus accommodation seems like the way to go
19/10/23, 10:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly @263773210548. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation and were able to take note of the same. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
19/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 321 0548: Yes it does
19/10/23, 10:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to see that you are following through. Continuing the discussion regarding Crystal's offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 321 0548: Yes
19/10/23, 10:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Crystal's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 10:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes we're together.Sorry I got a bit busy I'm at work
19/10/23, 1:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, I understand the commitments you have in place and I am glad to see that we are still able to move forward. @263773210548, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Crystal through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes may you explain
19/10/23, 1:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Let me help you here. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Crystal's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 1:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Crystal's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 321 0548: So basically we're to pay $600 for registration.So how do we go about making the payment
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263773210548. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 321 0548: No we stay in Mutare
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Thank you ma'am for
19/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 321 0548: The number
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 8:06 am - +263 77 321 0548: Yes please.It is an easier alternative.Travelling to Harare is more expensive for us
20/10/23, 8:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263773210548. If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 321 0548: Could I also have Sir Charles' WhatsApp number

20/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Charles Jerera: +263 77 376 9854
21/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Afternoon.We have been having network problems since yesterday.Thank you for Sir Jerera's number.I'll contact him
26/10/23, 9:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Crystal,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the messages you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions and thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your first part of the university registration fee. We have taken note of the receipt and have shared it with the accounts team for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is confirmed, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. The team will also notify the university officials about the payment.

13/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Crystal ,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process.
13/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.

May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!

15/12/23, 11:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.

After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU from Galgotias University, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Otherwise, If you are comfortable with your current university that's fine as well. Are you clear on this?
15/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes ma'am, thank you
15/12/23, 4:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263773210548, May I know if you have any doubt?
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 321 0548: We have no doubts bt were thinking the selection process is done and were hoping to be in a position to know where we stand since we still need to raise money for the Visa, airfare and accommodation.
15/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
15/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 321 0548: It's clear thank you
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263773210548. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/12/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 321 0548: Yes it's clear
15/12/23, 8:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263773210548, Have a good night ahead!
