20/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Following sir
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
20/11/23, 12:59 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Oky the University fee will be paid in a period of how long and why is it in a range of $500-$1000?
20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27625569098 I can understand your concern regarding the registration fee payment. Let me inform you that we will talk about the registration process in our upcoming session. However, Let me share some insight with you that help you understand better that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. 

Regarding the registration fees range, I hope your counselor must have shared the same with you during your counseling sessions as this is the registration fees which is paid in order to reserve your scholarship seat. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Thank you for your clarification sir.we can continue.
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27625569098, Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
20/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes I've learnt a lot things that is student must be open minded and must follow all Edoofa's instructions

Secondly Edoofa's vision is not just to provide affordable and quality education and making students employable through SEELS but to increase the student's capacity hence making them more responsible and independent

Thirdly I've learnt about the Edoofa's triangle that's attitude, skills and knowledge this means that a guy who has right attitude, right skills and right knowledge will have a brain value of his own which will equip him with better job opportunities in the future

Lastly SOP that's statement of purpose is issued after educational documents have been submitted and recommendations have been made by the Edoofa's counseling team. SOP must convince every school why you deserve to be there and one must spend 1 hour on admission scheme form
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263787913093, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir l totally agree and thanks for shading more information about these videos

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

22/11/23, 9:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Ok
22/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Ok sir
22/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir
22/11/23, 9:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Ok
22/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes
22/11/23, 9:30 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Good evening  sorry to join late i was in church , but thank you so much im really excited with the progress.
22/11/23, 9:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/11/23, 9:31 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
22/11/23, 9:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
22/11/23, 9:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
22/11/23, 10:07 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
22/11/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/11/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $9000 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/11/23, 10:16 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Oky following
22/11/23, 10:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/11/23, 10:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/11/23, 10:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/11/23, 10:32 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Okh sir i am following.
22/11/23, 10:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/11/23, 10:39 pm - +27 62 556 9098: So, in a nutshell  you will need to pay all your dues before they offer the acceptance  letter and also for visa application
22/11/23, 10:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me clarify @27625569098, You are required to complete the registration process after you receive your offer letter and once you complete the same you will be offered Admission Acceptance Letter. I hope you understand.
22/11/23, 10:42 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
22/11/23, 10:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/11/23, 10:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
22/11/23, 10:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
22/11/23, 10:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 10:50 pm - +27 62 556 9098: I cant wait please
22/11/23, 10:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27625569098 The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
22/11/23, 10:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
22/11/23, 11:06 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
22/11/23, 11:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
22/11/23, 11:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
22/11/23, 11:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
22/11/23, 11:17 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Can we proceed sir
22/11/23, 11:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
22/11/23, 11:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
22/11/23, 11:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
23/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 791 3093: Hello admission officer, I'm in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi amd and she has scheduled my session for (24-Nov-2023)
23/11/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa, I hope you are doing well. 

It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi, and that a session has been scheduled for tomorrow. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
23/11/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: With May I please know if you are available for the session now?
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Afternoon sir l completed the SOP
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with us. On this note, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 791 3093: No sir will be available from 20:00
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let me schedule our session for 8pm, please make sure to be available for the session.
23/11/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa, I hope you are doing well. 

 In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
23/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir l'm available
23/11/23, 8:09 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Good evening sir
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are available for the session, I hope you remember the first benefit of Endowment Plan could you please confirm?
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes that l gain first access to scholarship seats in leading Indian Universities
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, On this note Let's me share the second benefit with you.
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir
23/11/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
23/11/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/11/23, 8:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787913093 May I please know if you have taken a note of my message?
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes sir
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 791 3093: No sir
23/11/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263787913093, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
23/11/23, 9:38 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Following sir
23/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So are you excited for the process?
23/11/23, 9:40 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
23/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
23/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

23/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes

15/12/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes it is
15/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/12/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes it's understandable
15/12/23, 9:00 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Oky much understandable
15/12/23, 9:02 pm - +27 62 556 9098: So we need you to clarify  on due dates , visa application and flights tickets
15/12/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27625569098 I understand your queries, please don't worry we will address all your queries at the end.
15/12/23, 9:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/12/23, 9:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 9:08 pm - +27 62 556 9098: We have gone through it  sir
15/12/23, 9:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/12/23, 9:13 pm - +27 62 556 9098: This is much clear sir and it brings  much relief  on us parents.
15/12/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 9:19 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir like i said that it would be huge contribution .
15/12/23, 9:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 9:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
15/12/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 791 3093: Yes l will
15/12/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
15/12/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
15/12/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Tanatswa is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/12/23, 9:45 pm - +27 62 556 9098: The opposite is true and much preferable
15/12/23, 9:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/12/23, 9:52 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Can you please shed more light on this ..
15/12/23, 9:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 28th, 2023*.
15/12/23, 9:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 9:57 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes please.
15/12/23, 10:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 10:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 10:02 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes; this is much clear now.
15/12/23, 10:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 10:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 10:10 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Im here in South Africa , im his father the who will  be paying the money
15/12/23, 10:12 pm - +27 62 556 9098: So will i just use mama money like what i did when i paid for the registration fees for Edoofa
15/12/23, 10:18 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Is our session ended? Please is it oky if we can continue tomorrow,same time.Thank you.
15/12/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @27625569098, you can revert to the payment method you previously used Mama Money for your enrollment fee.
15/12/23, 10:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27625569098 Let me share the insights of the university with us and then we can conclude our session.
