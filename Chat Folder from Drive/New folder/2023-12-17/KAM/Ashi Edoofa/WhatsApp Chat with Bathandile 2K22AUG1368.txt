I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biochemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Most welcome,
Yes that's the course (Biochemistry),
Correct arriving in India August 2024

Accurate info
16/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok yes l still remember, thanks for sharing assist to catch fast
16/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok some of the questions needs my daughter since l am a parent some of the things I can't remember very well, lm sorry about that,, what l know is that l should make the paymentso that you process the application, and lm not quite sure about the exactly amount but the little l remember is that its around $700 if not mistaken.
Could you please share the accurate info
16/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, what you have mentioned is correct the registration fee is $750 and you will be required to make this payment to reserve your seat with the university as we move ahead with step 3, you shall have a better picture of the process. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
16/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thanks for sharing the info,, will discuss with his father about the payment/admission  that we should do when he's back from work,, 
Is it ok if we make the payment month end of October.
Could you please advise wether it will be late or ok, if its late then we can make other means to raise it quickly..
Or to make my question simply, the safest or guarantee time for admission or to pay $750 its up to when?
16/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772633191 thank you for your queries, I understand that as a parent these queries are normal to ask, however, please have faith as we will move ahead with our discussion all your queries will be answered step by step.
16/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thanks
I know l might not answered you well,, to make my self clear to you
Yes we are ready to start Admission process for the year 2024
16/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted, we can move forward
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you so much well understood..
Yes l agree that's impossible for a student to study at multiple universities
16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok l understood everything but l can't get the concept of the paid registration fee is *adjusted* within their first year fee, effectively reducing it to *zero*. 
Could you please clarify lm not getting it well.
How does it being adjusted? It means what?
If you can put it simple
16/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you explain. This fee of $500 to $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
16/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok ok yah l get the sense now
16/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you,
Yes we are on the same page
16/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you once again for making it loud and clear by giving example..
I understood very well
16/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
16/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
16/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Wow its loud and clear,
Thank you
16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
16/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted,
If l may ask the Visa fee its how much?
16/10/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with that, the Visa fee is for $83, please.
16/10/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ook loud and clear, 
thank you
16/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok affordable, 
noted and thanks
16/10/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as I would love to continue with our discussion however, it is past our available working hours now, and very late in India, so I would love to continue with our discussion tomorrow, may I know if tomorrow 12:30 pm would be suitable for you to connect with us?
16/10/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok will try my best to connect with you in that time.. though maybe it won't be easy

Thank you so much it was a nice discussion
16/10/23, 10:49 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Kindly add my daughter, l realised that she's not part of this group,, she existed the group by the time her phone misbehaved
16/10/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, you can please share her number, and I shall add her by tomorrow afternoon. <This message was edited>

17/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes for the discussion of yesterday lm certainly clear, but l have a question:
If it happens to not get good results at A-level, is it possible for her to come there using 
O-level results?
17/10/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please in our discussion today your query regarding this concern shall be covered so please do not worry, So are you excited to move ahead?
17/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes lm excited, we can move ahead
17/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 263 3191: No any queries, thanks
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one

With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

17/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok so if pursuing a Diploma course, is she still going to get the 50% scholarship from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok very clear to this one.
Thanks
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes lm cleared, thanks,,
If l may ask
Dimploma course its for how long?
17/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, a diploma is a 3 year degree.
17/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok
17/10/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted
17/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 263 3191: No queries, thanks
17/10/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Bathandile's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Bathandile is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Definitely much excited to initiate the process.
Wow that's good to secure the seat early, they have done so well, lets also do this for Bathandile.
Thanks
17/10/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am really happy to see your enthusiasm towards Bathandile's higher education. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted, thank you so much for the good work you are doing, 
Really appreciated.
Will extend the regards to the family

Be blessed
17/10/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words.

Hopefully you are in good health, me l am very well

I am happy on that, the process of my scholarship application for a university in lndia is going well and l got accepted.
But before we proceed further, about PDM university l am not interested on it because I googled about the university and l realised that it has lower rank when comparing it with other universities, and its condition does not suit me well.

I am looking forward to the following universities
*Galgotias University
*LPU

Thank you
16/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good afternoon Kirti
16/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Good Evening
16/11/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Bathandile,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/11/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand you here @263773736612 and I were even able to have a conversation with your friend and our proud Edoofian Persistence as well. Since the course you have chosen is a niche course hence the universities take time to evaluate the application please, rest assured both of your recommendations are our partnered universities and we are to get an update from Galgotias University by today day end, once we get an update I shall notify you, in the meantime let us discuss the offer letter from PDM university.
16/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Correct it was an exciting news to us,, and we have eagerly waited for the offer letter
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes we have gone through the offer letter thoroughly and l want to confirm some other things
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 373 6612: I understand Ms Kirti, and Thank you for communicating with Persistence.

I now understand everything. I was happy to here the news that l have been accepted.
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Okay Noted Ms Kirti. We can go ahead and discuss the details of the offer letter
16/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Sorry lm coming back in few minutes, have to sort out something
16/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Okay Ms Kirti l am now going over it once again
16/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263772633191 once you are back you can review our conversation and share your thoughts
16/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I shall wait for your response.
16/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 373 6612: 1. Per semester tution fee after the scholarship 
1st- 1315
2nd- 1315
3rd- 1315

2. Standard Duration of my course is 3 years 

3. Registration fee is $750


Thats how l got it.
16/11/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Yes Ms Kirti. I also did the calculations, l do agree with you.
16/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
16/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
16/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
16/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
16/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you for clarifying, l understand but need further clarity
Since we are paying the registration fee of $750 will it not reduce the tuition fee and accommodation for the first year?
16/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Noted Ms Kirti
16/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please for the first year, your registration fee will be adjusted towards your first-year tuition fee, however, we here are explaining to you annually so that you can plan your upcoming years as well, may I know if you are clear now?
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 263 3191: So for the registration fee $750 will the Edoofa assist to pay another amount?
16/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes now cleared
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Bathandile's total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Noted Ms Kirti. 

Am l correct by saying $2565 pays for everything listed above like
1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24 Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill and Electricity Bill
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are absolutely correct, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
16/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Yes Ms Kirti 

I was going through it right now.

I will surely try and work hard with my EWYL program  so that l can earn enough money to fund my education, believing l will be helping my parents
16/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Wow exciting news, this will really easy the burden of paying the fee. A really advantage of being an Edoofa students.
Thank you!
16/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Will really encourage her to work harder on her EWYL 😁
16/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 263 3191: A really flexible and dynamic opportunity,, very clear, thanks
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. Yes, indeed this is flexible and reduces the parents burden. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Bathandile with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 263 3191: That would be really a good achievement, awesome. 
She would be definitely assisted us a lot 
I really see the importance of EWYL
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Definitely l see the advantageous of the program
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Loud and clear, 
thank you so much for clarifying
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 29th 2023.
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
16/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted
16/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ye l still remember, meaning that us we  pay $600? am l correct?
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Bathandile's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of November 29, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of December 29, 2023 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 29, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 263 3191: There's no need to repeat, l still remember or  can go through the previous message if not sure
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, it is our responsibility to share the correct information.
16/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you so much, the process makes the payment not to be a heavy burden, l understand the explanation
16/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you, really appreciate the way you explains. You're committed and dedicated to your work
16/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for your kind words. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thats what we were asking our selves on how we are going to deposit the money to the given account to India
16/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 263 3191: I stay in Victoria Falls
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thank you
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok yes also provide the details for Mr Charles we will see which one to use
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thank you,, we will see which one to use
16/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 263 3191: No any queries all was clarified very well.
Thank you

Only the issue now is that, since Bathandile is not interested to the PDM university due to its low ranking when comparing to other universities, so can we wait the offer letter from other universities she's expected?
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the PDM university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
16/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok its loud and clear,
So now the way foward would be to be patient mybe we might get the positive response from the universities that she's expected.
Again the issue is a dilemma, we might wait yet the expected universities won't respond positive, the situation is very confusing.
But l guess its also important for her to go to the university that is in her interest.
Its a tricky one, so confusing
16/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. At the same time, since the university she mentioned is associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Galgotias University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM university, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
16/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Which Transfer option, sorry Ms Kirti l am not aware of it.
16/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yeah the situation is very confusing, l understand we might miss the opportunity, haa its tricky.
16/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM university without risking losing out on the scholarship.
16/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 263 3191: About transferring issue, you mean she can learn for the first semester or the first year then transfer to her expected university?
Will it be simple for her to transfer to other universities or maybe it might be a complicating one again?
16/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ms Kirti l tried to talk to Bathandile, hmmm she's not interested to the university, 
l think we should wait the response from other universities, 
let's pray for to go according to our wish and expectations
She will state her expected universities.

Thank you
16/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 373 6612: I am not interested in PDM university 

I  am looking forward to the following universities 

*Galgotias University

17/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good afternoon
Ok we'll be connecting at 06:00 pm
17/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Greetings Ms Kirti 

Ms Kirti , I am immensely grateful for your assistance in providing me with offer letters from various universities. However, I wanted to express that, after thorough consideration and extensive research within my family, my inclination leans significantly towards Lovely Professional University (LPU) compared to other universities.

The academic excellence of LPU, its diverse student community, and holistic approach to education deeply resonate with my educational aspirations. The university's commitment to fostering an environment conducive to both personal and professional growth aligns perfectly with my ambitions.

Ma'am, I would be overjoyed if you could facilitate an Offer Letter from LPU to proceed further. I trust and appreciate your dedication to assisting me, and I will always be grateful for your support. Wouldn't it be prudent for us to continue our discussions once we have an Offer Letter from LPU in hand?"
17/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good evening Kirti
Yes we have gone over it.
And we are happy for that
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, I understand, and as I mentioned yesterday since the course you have chosen is a niche course the universities take time to evaluate the application please, rest assured we have shared your application with LPU as well, once we get an update I shall notify you, in the meantime let us discuss the offer letter from Galgotia's university.
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Okay Ms Kirti. 

Thank you for reminding again 🙏. Yes lets discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University.
17/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 373 6612: Okay Ms Kirti l am going through it right now <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Qsn 1. $900
Qsn 2. 3 years
Qsn 3. $300
Qsn 4. $750
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 373 6612: 1. Per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is 900 USD

2. Standard Duration of my course is 3years 

3. Admission and procedure fee is 300 USD

4. Registration fee $750
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes it clarifies, thanks
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok noted and well clarified
17/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok ok yah I understand their concerns to student in terms of choices to accommodation
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Cleared, yes we can move foward
17/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Great news indeed, sounds good, 
Noted and thanks
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes we are together
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok l still remember, thanks
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now I am sure you must recall the payment modes from our discussion yesterday or would you want me reiterate them?
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok lm understanding it very well, thanks
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Definitely l recall the payment modes, thanks
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok thanks for explaining further, l understand
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 263 3191: If we decides for her to stay in the campus for security reasons, taking the accommodation for $2000, then the total per annum goes to $4000?
17/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good news
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Yes I understand, that would be great,, will encourage her to work hard to get more scholarship credits
17/11/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please the $2000 stated is an annual amount itself which includes food, basic needs like wifi, water, and electricity as well. However, I students prefer off-campus because it is a lot cheaper and offers the same facilities at a cheaper cost and I understand your concern as a parent regarding safety.

I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
17/11/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok ok yeah l get you, and l understand.
Thanks
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you no queries, we can move forward
17/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

17/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

I am happy that you shared one of my favorite hobby which is basketball.
17/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome Bathandile, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

They understood everything. Maybe they will arise with time, if some questions pop up l will notify you Ms Kirti so that you may help.

I can say it is a good university when l am comparing it to other Universities like PDM university . Galgotias University   is ranked 4652nd in the global 2023 rating and 203rd in India 

While PDM university is ranked 11 483 in the world and 776 in India  

Not only that but the education in Galgotias University   is quite good. One more thing it  has good infrastructures.
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear that you did your research! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

Good news 
We have sent $600 to Mr, Rajan
Will ask him to issue us a receipt then foward to you, after transferring it to Galgotias University account.
Will confirm when he will transfer the money, then update you
Thank you
24/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Hi Tholakele, your Mukuru order #113001242 to R Nayer Pls pay USD321 within 48hrs with REF:113001242 at your nearest Mukuru Branch or Mukuru Orange Booth.
24/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Mukuru: U paid $321 including fee $16.00 for Order 113001242 to Rajan Nayer ($305 MukuruPay Voucher: T4YKCNNE). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9
24/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Proof of that we have sent the money to him 👆🏼
24/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Bathandile.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation. However, a $16 transfer charge is yet to cleared and you can clear it by the next deadline. 

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 10:58 pm - +263 77 263 3191: You're welcome Kirti, thanks. I do not get what you're explaining about $16. You mean we should pay $16. What is it for?
Because we have cleared the 7% that was needed by Mr Rajan.
Our first payment was 
$321, the second payment was $305 and then the last payment was $16 making the totally payment of $642.

From $642, $42 is the 7% charge. 
Kindly verify from the messages that l sent to you, or you could also confirm from Mr Rajan.

Or maybe l misunderstood, you are free for further clarification

Thank you, stay blessed
25/11/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Bathandile,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I would like to clarify the details of your payments for a better understanding. The first payment of $321 you made has been fully processed, including the 7% transfer charges. Regarding your second payment of $321, including the $16 you paid was the fee charged by Mukuru for facilitating the transfer to Mr. Rajan. Consequently, from this second payment, Mr. Rajan received $305, resulting in a $16 transfer charge that remains outstanding.

Could you please confirm if this explanation has clarified the situation for you?
25/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good afternoon Kirti

Ok noted, l understand
its only that Bathandile's father is the one who made the first payment, then the second payment was done by her auntie due to the limitations of sending money per day maybe that's where the error has been made.

Will also explain to my husband

Thank you
25/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, could you please share the receipt for the second payment as well?
25/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Hi Tholakele, your Mukuru order #113001242 to R Nayer Pls pay USD321 within 48hrs with REF:113001242 at your nearest Mukuru Branch or Mukuru Orange Booth.
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 263 3191: The second payment 👆🏼
Ok yah l guess you're right, lm noticing what you are talking about, this one doesn't include the Mukuru charge

Ok thanks, will also explain to my husband, so that we move together
25/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, this is just one of the receipts that I have received that you shared earlier above, I would need the first receipt of the payment as well I believe Bathandile's father made the second payment as per what you said earlier?
25/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Hi Tholakele, your Mukuru order #113001242 to R Nayer Pls pay USD321 within 48hrs with REF:113001242 at your nearest Mukuru Branch or Mukuru Orange Booth.
25/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Mukuru: U paid $321 including fee $16.00 for Order 113001242 to Rajan Nayer ($305 MukuruPay Voucher: T4YKCNNE). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9
25/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 263 3191: We only have these two messages from Mukuru, the transaction was done twice to Mukuru sending to Mr Rajan. 
Should we also have other receipt?
What l was explaining was that Bathandile's father made the transaction twice to Mukuru and these are the transaction messages that he made
27/11/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 263 3191: Mukuru: U paid $17 including fee $1.00 for Order 113003420 to Rajan Nayer ($16 MukuruPay Voucher: Y3TKP3K4). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9
27/11/23, 8:24 am - +263 77 263 3191: Good morning Kirti
This is the message that was confusing us.
It was paid on the same day with the other transactions
My husband made an error of not sending it to me
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good evening Kirti

May you kindly respond,
Are we on agreement about the message that l sent?
27/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bathandile.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with a work meeting thank you for sharing that, I have taken note it it. However, just to be on the same page we have received the first part of the payment which is $321, so may I know if you could confirm the same?
27/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good evening 
We are doing very well, thanks
Ok l understand if it was because of the pressure at work

Yes we are on the same page, for the first payment of $321
27/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, may I know why did you mentioned $600 here, if you have only made the first payments, could you please help me provide clarity here?
27/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 263 3191: The reason why l said we paid $600 was that, the transaction was done twice the first transaction was of $321 including the $16 for Mukuru charges. 👇🏽

Mukuru: U paid $321 including fee $16.00 for Order 113001242 to Rajan Nayer ($305 MukuruPay Voucher: T4YKCNNE). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9

Then the second transaction was made of $321 excluding the Mukuru charge, again the transaction of $17 was made which was the charge of Mukuru. 👇🏽

Hi Tholakele, your Mukuru order #113001242 to R Nayer Pls pay USD321 within 48hrs with REF:113001242 at your nearest Mukuru Branch or Mukuru Orange Booth.

Mukuru: U paid $17 including fee $1.00 for Order 113003420 to Rajan Nayer ($16 MukuruPay Voucher: Y3TKP3K4). T&C’s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9

The reason why we paid $321 is that we were including Mr Rajan 7% charges, instead of paying $300.
Then it makes the total of $600 for both transaction that were done..
Why the transaction was done twice its because to send $600 once was impossible due to the Mukuru's terms and conditions
27/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you have made two payments but the order ID that you have shared is for one payment only, The first is $321 whose order ID is 113001242 and the other is 113003420 which is $17, if there is any other receipt with you or any other order ID  that needs to be shared, I would please encourage you to share the same so that we can verify?
27/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 263 3191: I don't understand, 
The issue was of us to pay $16 for the Mukuru charges.
Now if you're saying we should send the other receipt or other order ID that's another story, 
Does this mean the second transaction for $321 is now a pending issue of that you're not sure about the payment?

Maybe its just happened for these order to be the same, because these payment were done by two different people
27/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 263 3191: If l may ask, are you now cleared about the $16 for Mukuru charges we were suppose to pay, since I have shared the proof of that the transaction was made?
27/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me assist you here, please with a payment breakdown, so that you will be able to understand better what I am trying to say here:

Name of Student: Bathandile Tshambo
University Name: Galgotias University

Registration Fee Due: $750
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $150 = $600

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Rajan Mukuru
International Transfer Charges: $42 (07% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $600 + $42 = $642

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $321 (Paid on 24 November 2023)

Balance Amount Due: $642 - $321 = $321

This is the amount break that we have received for Bathandile's registration process as per our records $321 is still pending. 
and it can not be possible for the order to be the same because every transaction has a unique order ID.
27/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Ok l understand very well,
May you kindly confirm from Mr Rajan the total amount he has received from us for Bathandile, because we have made the transaction of $642 to him we should pay to the university, except if he's yet to pay this other $321. 
Will also confirm from him and come back to you. Also notify us after confirming from him

About the same Order to be the same now l don't know how was it done to the Mukuru's.
27/11/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as per the updates we have received this is the breakup that we have received please, once you connect with Mr Rajan I would encourage you to please update us about the same. Because for now this is what our records states.
27/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 263 3191: My worry now is on that, it seems we are now not together about the second transaction of $321, yet you have confirmed that the second transaction was received by Mr Rajan, only the shortage was of the $16 Mukuru charge
Kindly revisit the message that you have sent confirming that the second payment was done..
Now the issue you're explaining is why these orders are the same haaa l don't understand, the important thing is did he received the second payment of $321 or not? that's the needed answer

The message that you sent 👇🏽
27/11/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Good morning Parents and Bathandile,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I would like to clarify the details of your payments for a better understanding. The first payment of $321 you made has been fully processed, including the 7% transfer charges. Regarding your second payment of $321, including the $16 you paid was the fee charged by Mukuru for facilitating the transfer to Mr. Rajan. Consequently, from this second payment, Mr. Rajan received $305, resulting in a $16 transfer charge that remains outstanding.

Could you please confirm if this explanation has clarified the situation for you?
27/11/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you understand here, as you got confused with the two payment receipts, I also mixed up the details and responded and it was human error after your payment was confirmed by the accounts team for the first part, the team was able to connect with Mr. Rajan, and that is why I came back to you for clarity, because as per our records, we have only received the first part of the payment.
27/11/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Or maybe he's still going to deposit the $321, because what we know is that we made the second transaction.
Will come back to you tomorrow, after confirming from him
27/11/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let us reconnect tomorrow and you can update us about the same after the confirmation. Have a blessed night please.
27/11/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Thank you
27/11/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Kindly talk to the team to also verify again to Mr Rajan, so that you confirm and also l confirm again.

Thank you, be blessed
27/11/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I will. You are most welcome and thank you for your kind words.
27/11/23, 11:21 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Mukuru: U paid $338 including fee $17.00 for Order 112983064 to Rajan Nayer ($321 MukuruPay Voucher: HPA93PT3). T&C?s http://bit.ly/2AD6xf9
27/11/23, 11:29 pm - +263 77 263 3191: Im so sorry Kirti, l guess thus the message you were requesting, this one was for the first payment,  that was done.

Its only that lm not the one who made the transactions so aaa its so confusing but l guess with this one it clarifies everything.
So stressing lm really tired
27/11/23, 11:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is correct, this the receipt I was referring to, I understand, that it can be stressful. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

14/12/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Bathandile,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today.  I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
