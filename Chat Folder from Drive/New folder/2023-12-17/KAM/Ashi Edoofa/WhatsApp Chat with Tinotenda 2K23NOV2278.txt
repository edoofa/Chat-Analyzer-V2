09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

09/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263787769698. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
09/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes madam .. thank you for making it more clear.

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

User interface it is the space when  interaction between humans and machines occur.The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of machine while the machine simultaneously feed back information that aids the operator's decision making process.
The UX ( Unix) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating system that derive from original AT and T Unix.
User interface is the process of developing and creating menus and tools that allows users to  navigate a digital product .This I includes website, mobile apps and TVs .
The user interface design focuses on anticipating what user might need to do and ensure that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand and use to facilitate those action.

The UX focus on how users interact with products .It ensure that a website or app is intuitive and easy to navigate.UX design focuses on creating a meaningful user experience by understanding user needs, conducting research and design intuitive interface.

3.) OSI model describe the activities process and standard protocol used for cross system communication.The communication between computer system are split into seven different abstraction layers which are physical,data , network, transport, session, presentation and application.

Physical layer
Its function is to transport data using electrical, mechanical or procedural interfaces.
It deals with data in form of bits .

Data link layer
It is the second layer of the seven layers . This is the protocol layer that transfer data between nodes on a network segment across physical layer.

Network layer
It is the part of the internet communication process where these connection occurs by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks

Session layer
It manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.

Presentation layer 
Prepares data for the application layer. It is responsible for reformating compressing and encrypting data 

Application layer
It allows the user to use data access  and use network.

4.) Programming is the process if writing codes to facilitate specific action in computer.It is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
We have four types of programming languages which are imperative, functional, logical and object oriented.
Programming language is made up of specific terms and directions that are used to create some type of outputs  such as website,apps and other software language like Juvascripts and Python . 

Programming languages like JavaScript are the most commonly coding language used because most browsers utilize it and it is easy to learn.This types of programming languages are mainly used because they are fast and they runs immediately within a web browser and reduce loading time.
09/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 776 9698: 5.) A compiler is defined as a software that transforms an entire set of source code into object code and saves it as a file before executing it. Conversely, an interpreter converts and executes source code line by line without saving it and points out errors along the way.

 Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.

Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. 

A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
  A compiler translates high level language to machine language, at which point it can be translated at any time. To the contrary, an interpreter both translates and executes the high-level language.

11/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Computer Science)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Have joined the group
11/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 776 9698: The details are correct ma'am
11/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted @263777398790
11/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Noted .
11/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yhae I do agree.it is not possible ma'am.
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Noted
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Noted
11/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes ma'am.
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes ma'am.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes ma'am. It is clear.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Okay ma'am.
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 739 8790: So where does the earn as you learn program come in?
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 739 8790: The first $900 should be paid up 3 days after arriving in India next year August and the last $900 by January 2014? Is this correct
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay I see so one has to pay up the $1000 first
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Let me make it more clear please, the initial installment of $900 is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India which in August 2024, and the next installment in the month of January next year which is 2025. I hope that's clear?
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes thank you
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263777398790, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Is the $1000 registration amount a one off payment
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Also Ashi we  were told the scholarships range from 50-100% so is that the 50% amount
11/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow me to assist you here please that we have not shared the scholarship amount with you yet as the scholarship percentage is decided by the university officials, Once we apply Tinotenda's application at the universities then you will be able to find out the scholarship percentage. 

Moving forward to your concern related to the registration amount, We will discuss about the same in our session today soon.
11/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay thank you
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263777398790. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 739 8790: So registration should be paid up within that specified period of 30 to 45 days
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263777398790. The registration fees needs to clear with in the span of 30 - 45 days.
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan, to make you understand better.
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tinotenda, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 739 8790: I hear u clearly 😊 it's just that I have to pay the other outstanding $170 by 30 December if I am not mistaken and I have to pay another $450 within that period as well ummm
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your thoughts regarding the registration fees. Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you receive the offer letter from the university then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 739 8790: 👏 thank you I was already sweating in as much as I don't want my son to lose such a golden lifetime opportunity. My heart was already bleeding for him knowing how much hurt he would be if we fail him. We want him to achieve his dream.
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777398790, I truly understand your emotions. Please don't worry we are always here for you and Tinotenda. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 776 9698: No ma'am, you can proceed
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 739 8790: No it's all clear
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 739 8790: You can proceed
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Please go on
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 739 8790: We are very excited
11/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yes I am ma'am..
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
11/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Thank you so much

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/12/23, 10:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

15/12/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay thank you
15/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 739 8790: We are sorry for responding late just seeing the message now
15/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No problem @263777398790. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Ok
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263777398790 . Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 739 8790: 1. $900
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 739 8790: 2. 3 yrs
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 739 8790: 3. $300
15/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Thank you ma'am.
15/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 739 8790: 4.$750
15/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yaa I am understanding
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 739 8790: So I have to pay $900 and then pay for accommodation and food?
15/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263777398790, Regarding the same I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay I understand
15/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Honestly I thought as mentioned in other discussions it was supposed to be more affordable than here so that the under privileged can also attain the best education
15/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 739 8790: But I will do my best to try and make sure my son is able to come. It's not going to be easy
15/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 739 8790: I have $170 to pay by 30 November and I have another registration fee to be paid in 15 working days that's not a simple task
15/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Sorry 30 December
15/12/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me for not continuing our session at that moment due to network challenges, however I am here to continue with the discussion and assist you with your query. 

I can understand your thoughts and appreciate your willingness to support your child with the best education. As you have shared that you have a pending enrollment fess, I had a conversation with your career counselor and I would love to offer you a solution. However,  Before we proceed, with that I would like us to have a discussion about the offer letter in order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the offer letter and the university.  Once we have completed this discussion about the offer letter, We will redirect our conversation to your concern. I hope this sounds good for you ?
15/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay thank you so much.
15/12/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777398790, Let's continue with the discussion,  I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes it does thank you
15/12/23, 8:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263777398790, Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes am clear
15/12/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes I do
15/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Meaning I don't have to pay that really!! Thank you so much
15/12/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 739 8790: So I will have to pay $750 plus $170 is that correct
15/12/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 739 8790: It's a one off payment
15/12/23, 8:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me provide you more clarity with reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes please
15/12/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Wonderful plan thanks a lot
15/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes clear
15/12/23, 9:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Mutare is the nearest town we leave in Watsomba rural areas
15/12/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Thank you noted
15/12/23, 9:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/12/23, 9:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Harare is okay will make arrangements.,7*% is better than 12,5
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Network challenges
15/12/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 739 8790: I will use Mr Rajan thank you
15/12/23, 9:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, You can surely use any of the payment mode as per your convenience. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/12/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Noted
15/12/23, 9:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 9:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/12/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 739 8790: I see
15/12/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes thank you
15/12/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 739 8790: A good program indeed quite a relief
15/12/23, 9:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Yes it does clarify thank you
15/12/23, 9:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 9:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Ok dear thank you.
15/12/23, 10:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263777398790, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
15/12/23, 10:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

15/12/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay noted
15/12/23, 10:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777398790 As I have share that The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose which makes the registration fees zero. I hope this makes sense?
15/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Sorry dear so it means it's deducted from the first semester fees say I was supposed to pay $900 it's now less $750
15/12/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777398790 I am not able to understand your query, Could you please elaborate on $750?
15/12/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay may be you can explain where you said it's an integral part of first year education cost
15/12/23, 10:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777398790 No problem, As you are aware that your registration fees is $650, which will be adjusted in your first years fees (Integral Part of First year Education). If someone applies for scholarship without Edoofa Scholarship Program. In that case, they need to pay additional $650 for their admission. However, As you are an Edoofian you don't have to pay the additional $650. May I know if that's clear?
15/12/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 739 8790: Okay I see thank you
15/12/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 739 8790: It's clear
