05/09/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Deborah,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
05/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 372 2404: Greetings Mr Shivjeet ..My family and l have been good
05/09/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

06/09/23, 6:51 am - +263 71 372 2404: Good morning
06/09/23, 6:51 am - +263 71 372 2404: l am a proud edoofian
06/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Deborah.  I hope you are well and blessed.

Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for your participation.

10/10/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon! I trust this message finds you well and in good spirits.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
12/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 313 6077: yes.network challenges

I kindly request both you and Deborah to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well.

18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand please do inform to your mentor as well, dar.
18/10/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 1:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 313 6077: Ok.noted
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected? @263773136077
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 313 6077: yes iam connected
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 313 6077: Will read wen I get home
18/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, take your time to review and understand this benefit. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification once you've had the chance to read through it.
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 313 6077: iam a bit busy at work
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when you might be available?
20/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Deborah.

I hope you are well and blessed. I was waiting for a response from you the other day, hoping to continue our conversation regarding the admission process. However, I was not able to receive a response from your end concerning the same. I would like to let you know that I am now active and ready to take on our session. If you are available, please do let me know so that we can wrap up our session early.
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 313 6077: good evening
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 313 6077: I hve bn very busy at work.

20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. If you are comfortable now, we can finish our session. So, shall we proceed?
20/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 313 6077: it's ok
20/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 313 6077: but we don't hve electricity
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall try to wrap up our session as soon as possible. So, shall we proceed?
20/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 313 6077: ok
20/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 313 6077: fine
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to read this above message?
20/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 313 6077: my battery low
Let's proceed tomorrow
20/10/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, let's continue our session tomorrow. Please ensure your battery is charged and you have a stable connection. Have a good night, and we'll talk tomorrow. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, feel free to reach out.
21/10/23, 7:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Deborah!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 372 2404: yes
21/10/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 372 2404: Greetings
21/10/23, 9:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you were able to go throgh this above message?
21/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 372 2404: yes it does
21/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 372 2404: yes l did
21/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 372 2404: yes its cleae
21/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 372 2404: clear
21/10/23, 10:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 10:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 10:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 372 2404: l understand .... theres nothing l would like to inquire about
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 372 2404: Am not aware .Please provide more information
23/10/23, 6:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Deborah!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time
23/10/23, 6:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Deborah!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
25/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 372 2404: Greetings
25/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 372 2404: l am a proud Edoofian
30/10/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Deborah.

I trust you are enjoying good health and that this new weekend brings blessings and a swift end to any lingering Monday blues. I was hoping to get a response from your end but it seems that my previous message was left unnoticed.

I'm pleased to inform you that I am currently active and fully prepared to engage in your session. Furthermore, I want to make you aware that I will also be accessible in the evening, starting from 7:00 PM, in case you happen to be occupied at this moment. If you are ready to proceed now, kindly let me know so that we can initiate the session. <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 6:54 am - +263 71 372 2404: greetings l am a proud edoofian
31/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 372 2404: greetings
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
31/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 372 2404: yes u may
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
31/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 372 2404: yes thats true
31/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 372 2404: yesss
31/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
31/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 372 2404: l agree
31/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
31/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
31/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 372 2404: okay
31/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
31/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

31/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
