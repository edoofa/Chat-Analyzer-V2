09/09/23, 8:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Kirsten,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

26/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
26/09/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Okay,l don't remember much sir...but l recall that there must be a registration fee paid, $750,if l am not mistaken
26/09/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
26/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
26/09/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
26/09/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
26/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Oh yeah, clear
26/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Following
26/09/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Mmm it's clear....if l do come across something that l feel l should ask,l will definitely do that.thank you
26/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
26/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Mmm l don't but l don't know if my parents can arrange for so much money in 2 weeks....l think that's a very short space of time sir ....is it also possible to pay once l am in India with the other tuition fee?
26/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
26/09/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yeah l see
26/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir...have a good night

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: You are welcome
03/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir, thank you
03/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I can't wait....yes we are
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

03/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
04/10/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Kirsten . 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
04/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Oooh that's wonderful sir...thank you for the good news

It's okay, we can always continue
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Afternoon sir
Yes
05/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
05/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright following
05/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Clear
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes l understand
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 11:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I propose that we reschedule and connect with each other at 3:00 PM on Monday. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter are highly appreciated.

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 617 4100: Goodmorning sir
Thank you
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I am fine thanks how are you sir
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
Goodnight
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
13/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
16/10/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kirsten!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
16/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I am really sorry for not responding on time sir...l think my mom and dad must be going through network challenges or something else...my apologies on their behalf...we can continue with the session if you are still here
16/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize, Kirsten. I understand that technical and communication challenges can happen. I'm here and ready to continue with the session
16/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are currently following through our discussion or the admission process?
16/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Following
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Clear
16/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I am not sure sir...l guess it will be better if you provide me with more information, that would really help .
16/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
16/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
16/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Oww, okay
16/10/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
16/10/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Clear
16/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes
16/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright
16/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sir, suppose you pass your A level and then fail to raise fees for the seat,how does Edoofa handle such cases?
16/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your concern. In that case, the university has the right to revoke your offer letter. May I know if you are clear here?
16/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright l understand
16/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
16/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 617 4100: That's good sir...yes
16/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your pplication and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
16/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
16/10/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
16/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir, thank you

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Greetings sir
03/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you for the good news... I am so happy
03/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 713 6621: Greetings sir,Thank you so much.
03/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm thrilled to hear your excitement and happiness about the offer letter. It's a significant achievement for you and your family, and I'm here to assist you in making the most of this opportunity. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir... Thank you
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I understand
03/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Greetings Mr Shivjeet. I'm sorry I'm joining you now, a little late for the session.
03/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Thank you for all the efforts to afford our daughter such a golden opportunity to study in India. We are so excited
03/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok, thanks
03/11/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize for the timing, and I appreciate your understanding. I'm delighted to hear your excitement about the opportunity for your daughter to study in India. It's a significant achievement, and I'm here to assist you with all the information you need to make the most of it.

Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 617 4100: 1)$900       2)3 years     3)$300      4)$750
03/11/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 312 2747: (1) Per tuition  fee after the scholarship offer is 900. (2) Standard duration - 3 years. (3) 300. (4) 750
03/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Following
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok
03/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Can we possibly ask for clarifications in the course of your enlightenment, Sir?
03/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes please ask, where you o you need my help understanding about the same.
03/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok, thanks.
03/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Wanted to enquire about safety of foreign students in general, particularly those of the fairer sex. Can it be guaranteed when they choose to find alternative accommodation outside campus? And please give us a picture of possible maximum distances of learners from the university if students choose to leave outside campus.
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are inclined towards off-campus accommodation, as an Edoofian, our team will also assist you with the contact details of students and people who can help you find suitable accommodation within your community. Ensuring the safety of our students is our top priority. During our session, I will provide you with insights so that you will be more confident and at ease.

I hope this brings you some relief, and we are on the same page?
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Yeah, sure. It does.
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 312 2747: You could possibly move on to the next stage of our discussion. Asking too many questions before you get to the end of what you had prepared for us may end us in an endless digression, so you could please continue
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. Let's proceed with our discussion. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. I was hoping for a reply from your end so that we can complete our discussion of the offer letter. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I see
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you so much sir
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Goodnight
03/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Yeah, it does.
03/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 312 2747: We can proceed
03/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 312 2747: I suspect I'm experiencing network challenges as I've not received any messages since 21:50
03/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 312 2747: You can proceed with the discussion with Kirsten as she is in better network, and the moment mine improves, I'll catch up with you
03/11/23, 10:55 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Lemme resend sir's messages to you
03/11/23, 10:56 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. I was hoping for a reply from your end so that we can complete our discussion of the offer letter. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 6:24 am - +263 77 312 2747: Thanks, Kirsten. The messages did come through after quite a while of waiting.
04/11/23, 6:25 am - +263 77 312 2747: Anyway, we'll reconnect with him today 0900 hours local time when I'll have the opportunity to ask a few more questions.
04/11/23, 6:31 am - +263 77 312 2747: Good morning
04/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sir is it possible to pay maybe half of the fee before the deadline and pay the remaining fee after
04/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely I am coming to that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
04/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Can you explain more about that sir.... I remember you talked about it before, l am sorry for taking you back
04/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize; it's important that you have a clear understanding. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
04/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
04/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Awww, thank you so much sir ... It sounds better now
04/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yeah it does... Thank you
04/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
04/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir
04/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 617 4100: In Mutare
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I will tell dad about it
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mukuru Account Details

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare
Contact Number: 0772460067
National ID Number: 63 1037566X00
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
04/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
04/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir thank you
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Dad will reply when he comes online
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Kirsten!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Greetings sir how are you
06/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the sesion?
06/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 617 4100: You are welcome... Yes l am
06/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let me share his details as well. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
06/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you you were able to recieve the details here.
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
06/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right Kirsten, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are following here as well?
06/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Following
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
06/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Following
06/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
06/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Clear
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
06/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
06/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
06/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
06/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir
06/11/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Mmm no sir, if my dad was here , he would have asked... But don't worry, he will ask tomorrow when he comes online
06/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your patience. Please feel free to reach out to me or ask any questions whenever you or your dad are ready. I'm here to provide you with the information and support you need. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to our next session when your dad is available.
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).
06/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.

07/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Kirsten,

On that positive note, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I am fine how are you sir
07/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 312 2747: We are all fine. Thank you
07/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 312 2747: My apologies that I failed to join you in yesterday's session. I however did go through the discussion and understood it
07/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're doing well, and there's no need to apologize for missing the previous session. Life can get busy, and I understand that.

It's great that you had a chance to go through the discussion. Moving forward I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter?
07/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Thank you sir. I think we could proceed with today's session. I'll ask questions along the way should I have any.
07/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok, you're asking specifically about the offer letter. I don't think I have any question at the moment
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would like to let you know that our session has almost concluded for now as we have discussed the overall offer letter and it was a great discussion I had with Kirsten she was proactive and did really well.
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
07/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday 10:00 AM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
07/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok, thanks, but I do not think I'll be available at the said time as I will be committed at my workplace. So please feel free to proceed with the session with our daughter, then I'll go through it and ask questions if I have any
07/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your schedule, and I understand your work commitments. We'll proceed with the session with  Kirsten, and I'll make sure she has all the necessary information and answers any questions she may have.

If you have any questions or concerns that come up after the session, please don't hesitate to reach out. We want to ensure that both you and Kirsten have all the support you need throughout this admission process.

Feel free to contact me or Kirsten anytime, and we'll be here to assist you. Have a great day!
07/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Thank you and good night
09/11/23, 10:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Kirsten. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 617 4100: Greetings sir how are you
09/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 617 4100: Sir, we are having negative views on the university you gave me?
09/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 617 4100: I am sorry to ask but sir, honestly l am getting scared now... I don't know about my dad but l am sure he is also going through the same
09/11/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's alright you don't need to worry about that I will help you clear this negativity, dear. May I know where you received these views, dear?
09/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 617 4100: me unless you have fake tippers who will tell u to join this.

please don't join this university. main problem is locality. worst “uneducated gujjar” crowd you have ever seen. they dont know how to behave, how to talk, they just know how to abuse you and how to beat the shit out of you with their gang.

worst faculty, some teachers are good but they dont want to teach. full of retards. if you are from delhi or some good reputed eductaed place, you will suffer for your decision of joining it later.

i am not someone who hate this or anything. i just wanted to draw the exact truth after you. now its your choice.

i can bet you will remember this anonymous person in every condition either you joins it or not…

A big NO!

Reasons-

Worst Faculty. Would be keeping you on your knees. If you're not among the favorite bunch forget about attendance and marks.
They do not care about anything but MONEY. Would ask you for fees even after you have submitted. Unnecessary fines and charges are their favorite.
Poorest Management. They will declare holidays and when students are home they would just release notice to be present for classes from next day. How can one appear in class next day of notice release. Trains and buses take time.
Their portal is a headache more than a facility. Even if you have submitted your fee

From my experience, I would say NO!!

If you're an undergraduate it can be quite pleasing for you all but for people who want to do Master's program from Galgotias University, a big NOOOO.

I took my admission in M.Sc. Physics thinking that it's closer to Delhi NCR, must have nice aura of students but the college administration and faculty are so bad I can't even describe but I will …

Firstly they tell you to hurriedly pay 25k rupees to book your slot as the course have less seats.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.

Once you pay, you will regret. I took admission and the faculty kept me waiting for whole month a

How is life at the Galgotia University?
Okay so I was planning to share my experience since long.

The short answer is “Pretty Bad”.

Now the reasons why I quoted the same can be listed below

Awful Management : Me being a student of the aviation course that they offer, have suffered a lot alongwith my fellow classmates in a number of ways due to the inefficiency and rudeness of the management. They simply don't comply with your expectations and they find ways more than one to make your life miserable. It's disheartening for a student to see themselves suffering just because of the inefficiency of the faculty/management. For example: One

Yes! You should, but if it is campus 1.

There is a huge difference b/w campus 1 and campus 2. I was at campus 2, but the condition of this campus in terms of placement is so bad. If you want to choose mechanical or civil then campus 2 is not a right choice for you. All that you heard in the answers below is about campus 1.

Too much discrimination by the companies, if you are studing at campus 2.

Fee is less for campus 1 in compared to campus 2.

Campus 2 is totally under developed. I think no one wants to pay high for the under developed campus.

I can give you 100 reasons for not joining campus 2.

go for the campus 1.

good luck.

What is a reason to choose Galgotias University?
I’m in my 3rd year of B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I’ll list all the genuine things that I saw, felt and figured about “Galgotias University”. I’ll first tell you why to choose and then why not! You yourself have to figure out the final thing.

So, here I go with the reasons why to choose GU:

The fee is affordable if compared to other NCR colleges.
You’ll get placed. Placements are better than any other private NCR college.
But 90% crowd gets placed in IT companies on 3LPA, in BPOs, etc
Only a few get placed on 5–12 LPA.
The course structure is quite updated with industry needs.

Although it is a private university but it provides good placement and internship opportunity. Galgotias helps the student to prepare for the placements in all aspects eg. Attitude, personality, interviews etc. they provide ample opportunity for the students in entrepreneurship. At same time they have great alumni networks.

How can I pay the fee for a B.Tech at Galgotias University?
official site has a fee payment facility that is through RTGS,NEFT,NETBANKING and u can visit the site and can make the payment .

There is another option of DD( demand draft)which u can make through the banks and pay .

These options are available in my college so I advised u also but if you are paying for the first time u should consult to the college or university that will be more better option .

What is a reason to choose Galgotias University?
I’m in my 3rd year of B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I’ll list all the genuine things that I saw, felt and figured about “Galgotias University”. I’ll first tell you why to choose and then why not! You yourself have to figure out the final thing.

So, here I go with the reasons why to choose GU:

The fee is affordable if compared to other NCR colleges.
You’ll get placed. Placements are better than any other private NCR college.
But 90% crowd gets placed in IT companies on 3LPA, in BPOs, etc
Only a few get placed on 5–12 LPA.
The course structure is quite updated with industry needs.

How is CSE at Galgotia University?
I would suggest that don’t take the answers or opinions of the alumni(s) very seriously as they would mostly tell the bright side of University (sometimes even a lie) as this is kind of a human nature that when we pass out from any college or school we tend to have feeling of belongingness doesn’t matter how it was back then and, we tend to ignore or overpass the hardships we have been through.

Now, being current student of CSE in GU , I would say that if your father(or guardian) has collected room full of BLACK MONEY , then you are most welcome , because GU has a moto : Paisa Phek Tamasha Dekh

09/11/23, 10:40 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, dear I understand where you are coming from and I am really impressed that you have gone through immense research about the university as your Admission Officer I would like you to be clear on this matter too. Regarding the mixed reviews you've come across, it's important to keep in mind that online reviews can sometimes be misleading. Students' experiences can vary widely, and while some may have had negative experiences, others might have had highly positive ones. Sometimes, students post inaccurate information or have specific grievances that don't reflect the overall quality of the institution.
09/11/23, 10:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would request you to be a bit open-minded and try to understand the education system of India and its place on a global level with a clear head. 

I am sure you are aware and agree that we as educators have been working in the Education sector for over 13 years and if we were not helping students fulfill their educational requirements or match their university expectations, no students would want to be a part of the Edoofa Program or want to plan their education in India, but that is not the case, there are only 2100 seats and more than 1000 of students apply to the Edoofa Program every month. There is a reason they have been doing that and to help you plan your education well, you too will have to put your faith and be a bit open to understanding the process right.

I hope I was able to clarify your thoughts about the university. <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 617 4100: Alright thanks
09/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 617 4100: It's okay sir
09/11/23, 10:49 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright then, dear. May I know if you are now comfortable proceeding with the session?
09/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir
09/11/23, 10:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
09/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir... We were so happy to receive the offer letter.Such a great opportunity has come to our family, so obviously we would be so excited... I don't know if dad has questions, he will ask
09/11/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
09/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 617 4100: Sir,if we pay the 600 needed now.... How much will be needed when l reach India?...
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely let me help you with that as discussed with you about the breakdown. Your total fee for your first year is $2800 and if you pay $600 with the inclusion of the grant of $150 totaling with an amount of $750 you will be left with $2050 for your first year's cost of education. May I know if you are clear on this?
09/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 617 4100: Clear, thank you
09/11/23, 11:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
09/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sorry sir, l will catch up with you after my exam
09/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, dear. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and will be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends. <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
09/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir, happy Diwali... It's actually my favourite Indian festival 🤗🤗
09/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sir,dad was and still wants assurance that l will be safe at the university and so he went to Google and bumped into that information that l have shared with you... So he wanted to ask questions himself, actually l rushed... But anyways thank you, if he wants to know more he will ask... It's just that today he has a tight schedule at work
14/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kirsten. 

I completely understand your dad's concern about your safety at the university. It's important for parents to feel reassured about the well-being of their children. If your dad has any questions or concerns, please let him know that I'm more than happy to address them. Whether it's about campus security, support services, or any other aspect, I'm here to provide the information he needs to feel confident about your experience at our university.
14/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Greetings sir
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you
14/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Ohh, Happy Children's day
14/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Mmm yeah but dad is not online
14/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear. I believe your dad can catch up with us anytime and can ask any question he likes about the university. Now, as you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
14/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
14/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
14/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected with the session so that we can proceed and complete it within our time frame to avoid any delays on the offer letter? @263776174100
14/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Okay, thank you sir
14/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you
14/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Awww, wonderful will connect with her
14/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
14/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
14/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sorry sir, l had my last paper today so l was tired and just fell asleep.. my apologies
14/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Mmm not yet sure sir, l think dad will pay 300 this time
14/11/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize, and congratulations on completing your last paper! That's a significant achievement, and it's completely understandable if you needed some rest.

I appreciate the update regarding the payment plan. If your dad decides to make the initial payment of $300, that's absolutely fine. It's essential to choose an option that aligns with your financial preferences.
14/11/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
14/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you sir
14/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sir l don't know yet but maybe on the 16th
14/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
14/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Yes sir, that's right... Thank you
14/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
14/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
14/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Alright sir
14/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Noted, thank you
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Kirsten. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

As per our recent conversation that we had the previous day, I believe that you might have been able to connect and have a conversation with Ms. Valerie regarding your higher education journey. I would also like to let you know that tomorrow marks the deadline of your first part of your university registration fees for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Hence, I wanted to inquire about your preparation for the payment, and as your admission officer, I do not want any potential discrepancies that may lead to losing out on this offer letter. May I kindly ask about your preparation regarding the finances for the first part of your registration fee?
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Good evening Sir. We are all well and we're meeting just now now with our daughter who has just completed her Advanced Level studies. The family meeting tonight will determine our decision and it is our sincere hope that you'll be patient with us as we share our views at family level. I must however point out that you went on holiday before I could ask you a few questions regarding the scholarship, the responses of which would have helped us in timely decision-making. First of all I had concerns over security of foreign students in general and girls in particular. I then was forced to google the university to find out if I could get any information regarding safety of students. Yeah, from your responses to Kirsten on the issue, you were quite sincere and balanced. Secondly, I wanted to enquire about the ewyl points that were earned by Kirsten from the tasks that she was assigned over the time she has been interacting with the edoofa team. Have the points accumulated been factored in, and if so, how much did she score in monetary terms.
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your update and understanding regarding the family meeting. It's essential to make decisions collectively, especially when it comes to higher education.

Regarding the concerns you raised, I'm glad to hear that my responses provided some clarity. Security is indeed a valid consideration, and it's great that you took the initiative to gather additional information. However, I would like to let you know that regarding Kirsten's EWYL credits, it is best discussed with your EWYL Mentors as they will be the best person to guide you through the details and reports for Kirsten. Now coming to my previous discussion I would like to discuss your readiness for the payment. As your admission officer, I aim to ensure a smooth process without any possible issues that could result in the forfeiture of the offer letter. Could you please provide information about your financial preparation for the initial registration fee?
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Then, I also wanted to know how much an air ticket from Harare to Delhi costs, and whether we'll be required to pay for both the to and fro journey
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 312 2747: The other question is, suppose that we face challenges with meeting the 16 Nov deadline, can we possibly opt to postpone Kirsten's placement in the university to 2025.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 312 2747: How much in US$ is the fare for a ride in a rickshaw or kombi, whatever you call it in India. I had all these questions to ask you but could not do so as you were on holiday.
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok. Our plan is to make payment of 300us tomorrow, that is if we agree that Kirsten flies to India for her university education
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely regarding your concern about the plane ticket it would be on a range of $400 to $500. And you are not required to pay the ticket with the return included.
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok, thank you.
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In addition to that the intake for Kirsten will commence after August 2024 and hence you have the time on your favour to plane you finances regarding the plane ticket.
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Coming to this query if Kirsten wants to travel locally ner her university it would cost a sum of $10 on an average per month. As India has one of the cheapest means of local transport.
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here on this. I would like to inquire please the reason behind the gap year as in this case there would be a gap year. During this year most of the peers of Kirsten will be completing one year ahead of her.
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 312 2747: The chief reason is based on our financial preparedness as a family to be able to pay those expenses as you explained. To be honest, I had hoped for a higher %age. I really appreciate the offer but even at half the normal fees, the 2800 is a little unfriendly considering our source of income
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, and I completely understand the financial considerations. I would like to remind you about the Discussion about the EWYL that we had during this session regarding the credits that would be of great help to the finances. May I know if you were able to go through the same?
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Yeah, I did, and my interpretation was that the points earned would be deducted from the total fees cost per annum. I stand to be corrected here if I'm wrong
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 312 2747: It's of concern that in the calculation for Kirsten's fees, there is no mention of points earned, which would then be deducted from total fees per annum
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for bringing that up. It's important to clarify the details of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. The program typically allows students to earn credits by participating in various activities or part-time work, and these credits can be used to offset a portion of the tuition fees.
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: And regarding the credits earned may I know if Kirsten is keeping in regular touch with her mentor?
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Yeah, true, so my query still lingers unexplained. You work as a team there and naturally, I would think that calculation of fees for Kirsten's scholarship would factor in points earned as she went to through various assignments that she was given
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you know that the fees that would be paid for Kirsten's higher education has nothing to do with the EWYL points/credits. The credits are to be earned form the project or assignment that she was or will be assigned form the her mentor. Which gives me the suggestion to connect with the mentors for the credits and the projects. May I know if you are clear here ?
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Yeah, I understand, but we have only a few remaining hours to make consultations before we are in the deadline
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. So may I know if you please be clear and precise with me on what do you wish to know I am happy to guide you on this.
15/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Thank you. May I know how many credits were earned by Kirsten and if there are any, are they not supposed to be deducted from total fees cost per annum
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you know that Kirsten has earned $22 interns of credits and they can be used to deduct the tuition fees once she commences her higher education journey. Please let me know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 312 2747: I am. Thank you.
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now I would like to add that with regular connection with her mentor can easily build up the credits and leading to even higher reduction of the tuition fees.
15/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Ok
15/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, coming to the deadline of the registration fees. May I know if you have made up your plans as of now ?
15/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 312 2747: I'll come back to you in a few moments. We are still deciding. It's not an easy decision, Sir
15/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand that deciding on such matters can take time please be aware of the deadline as well, and it's an important decision for you and your family. Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Thank you, good night, Sir.
16/11/23, 5:16 am - +263 77 312 2747: Good morning Mr Shivjeet. May I know how much in total I should pay to Mr shorwi suppose I want to deposit us$300 as Kirsten's registration fee. Is it exactly 300 or there is a transaction charge
16/11/23, 11:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kirsten. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for reaching out to me. With the inclusion of the 12.5% transfer charges it would be a total of $337.5

17/11/23, 3:42 am - +263 77 312 2747: Good morning Mr Shivjeet. I hope I find you well. It's quite unfortunate that I ended up depositing part of Kirsten's registration fee in Mr Shorwi's old bank account. I hope that will not cost me and my daughter in terms of time since yesterday was the deadline. May I suggest that Mr Shorwi's old account details be removed from your database if they are no longer of any use, to avoid such costly mistakes. I had asked for yesterday as a day off from my superiors who had allowed me the day on the understanding that I would report for duty today, (17/11/23). Can I therefore request that I visit FBC Saturday and have this corrected. If you still insist that I go there today, let me know, please.
17/11/23, 3:50 am - +263 77 312 2747: I also have plans to complete payment of the remaining part of Kirsten's registration fee Saturday, 18/11/23.
17/11/23, 5:26 am - +263 77 312 2747: Just to put you in the picture, I have to travel over 45 km to get to the bank.
17/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Greetings Mr Shivjeet, dad has gone to town to check with the bank and redirect the payment
17/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kirsten. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I hope you are doing well today. If that's the case, it's alright for now. If there's an alternative means, I would like to share an update with you. Since the account details have been updated from our end, the payment will not proceed. As your father is going tomorrow, which is Saturday, to the bank, your father can ask to redirect it accordingly. Please share this with your father to avoid any confusion.
17/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Sir, dad is already in town
17/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 617 4100: He could not get in touch with you so he thought it's mandatory to pay today
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 617 4100: I am not getting it sir, dad had to travel to town again ... Please can you be a bit clearer here
17/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sorry for the late reply here, dear.  I meant to say that it is alright as your father has gone to revert the transfer today itself. The above message was an instruction that I was giving if your father plans to go to the bank tomorrow.
17/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I got to the bank and was told by an attendant at the Information Desk that a correction had already been made to the effect that the amount that I deposited in Mr Shorwi's old account has now been redicted into his new account. I was assured that everything would be ok. I then asked for proof to send to you so that you would get satisfied that payment has been made, but the attendant was vehement in  convincing me that that was no longer necessary. The correction, I learned, did not need my presence for it to be made.
17/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 77 312 2747: *redirected*
17/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know it is well noted with the team.
17/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 312 2747: Welcome, Sir.
17/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 617 4100: Thank you
23/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon dear parents and Kirsten . I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
