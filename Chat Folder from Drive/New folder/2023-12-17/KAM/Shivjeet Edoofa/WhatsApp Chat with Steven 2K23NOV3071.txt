16/12/23, 8:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In this one-hour session, I, as your dedicated admission officer, will connect with you to explore your academic journey, understand your experiences, and gather essential information for your scholarship application. I'll also discuss your daily availability for future sessions. Count on me to guide you through the initial steps and address any queries you may have.

Simultaneously, I am providing you with two essential forms which are to be filled out during our session on December 18th. To stay proactive, please print these forms in advance and have them ready for the session. I will guide you on filling them out during our discussion.

Starting from our sessions on the 18th, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on the steps needed before December 26th. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on December 26th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.
