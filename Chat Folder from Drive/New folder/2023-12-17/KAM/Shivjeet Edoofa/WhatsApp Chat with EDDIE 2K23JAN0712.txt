Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi.

10/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes that's  very correct sir.

10/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming. Take your time to gather the necessary documents. Tomorrow is absolutely fine for submission.

11/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Afternoon sir,
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I have managed to get those documents
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Ee are truly excited  about the opportunity sir.and as a family we are praying that this beautiful dream come to reality for our son.
11/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 902 0225: ...we are truly...
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 902 0225: We do look forward to the letter of acceptance sir
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
11/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yess l seem to be getting the idea sir,  but l would be happy to be enlightened
11/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Ok, l will be able to start the registration process earlier before my A'Level results are out
11/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 902 0225: That is excellent
11/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Oh yes sir, it si quite a beneficial facility to students as cushions them against fee increases
11/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Ok, l understand it sir.
12/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I have understood the arrangement sir
12/10/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I would be happy if you enlighten me more sir
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yess, l think l understand the process now sir.The Endowment  Plan is quite proactive and sets aspiring students on track to complete their registration process and it also helps students financially through a flexible registration payment plan.
12/10/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I particularly agree with option 2.
Where it affords students an option to persue Diploma program when their A'level results do not qualify them for a degree program
12/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes l get it.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes sir
12/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I understand it
12/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Ok, l understand sir
12/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I will connect with you at 3:00 PM tomorrow. Have a great night and warm regards to your lovely family.
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes, yes sir.l am online today .how are you sir.
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Sorry yesterday l was offline the whole day.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize. I understand that schedules and availability can change. I'm doing well, thank you.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As EDDIE's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that EDDIE is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 902 0225: We are truly excited sir and looking forward to Eddie securing his scholarship place.it is an exciting opportunity that will really open doors of opportunity for Eddie and we are ready to support him to achieve his goals
17/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for EDDIE's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 902 0225: That is great news sir.We appreciate your efforts and dedication to your work .We hope and look forward to Eddie successfully coming to India and join other proud Edoofians in persuing their careers under you dedicated team and leadership.
17/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: hank you for your kind words and trust in our process. We're committed to ensuring that Eddie's application is handled meticulously and with great care.

02/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Eddie,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today regarding the discussion of the offer letter.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
03/11/23, 11:16 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Oughh very sorry sir for the late response its monthend this side so lts usually very busy at my shops and l open my WhatsApp for very limited time.very sorry sir.
We are very excited  to learn that our son Eddie has been accepted by Galgotias University. 
We have been anxiously waiting for this moment and we are very happy sir.We cant wait to proceed with the admission  process sir and may you arrange for our session so that we complete the registration process before the deadline.
04/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
04/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes l clearly understand  and appreciate the Payment plan you have put in place to enable a smooth registration process for all parents
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you understand and appreciate the payment plan. Our goal is to make the registration process as smooth and manageable as possible for our students and their parents.
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
04/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I stay in Chiredzi town here in Zimbabwe
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
04/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I have my brothers who live in Harare.its not a problem at all sir.
04/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
04/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mukuru Account Details

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare

04/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
04/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 902 0225: You can send me the FBC account details.Its fine. But l will try my best to pay through Mr Rajan
04/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
04/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please lt me know if you were able to recieve the details?
04/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yess l received the details sir, thank you
04/11/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
04/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Thank you a lot Mr Shivjeet.It was a very fruitful session indeed and we hope to continue on this promising journey together.
04/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Have a nice weekend sir.
06/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Eddie!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 404 0667: Good Evening Sir l hope you had a nice weekend we are ready so we can proceed Sir
06/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and yes I did had a great weekend.
06/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With further continuation. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
06/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
06/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
06/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
06/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 404 0667: Yes it's very clear and understandable
06/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 404 0667: Thank you sir hav a blessed night
06/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the error in the above message; it was supposed to be shared with another student of mine for the completion of his session for the day. I have now deleted it. Please let me know if you are still available so that we can proceed with the session?
06/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further and hopefully complete our letter discussion in time for today? @263774040667
06/11/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as itt is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Eddie, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

On that positive note, I am here to continue with our session for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Shall we begin?
07/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Good evening sir, we are active now for today's session
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to see that. Now for further continuation, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
07/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 902 0225: Yes sir it is very clear
07/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
07/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
07/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 902 0225: I don't have any questions sir
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, then. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

07/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you find the university's student-centered approach encouraging. Indeed, it's a noble and valuable policy that ensures students receive the support and resources they need for a successful educational journey.  Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
07/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
07/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.
