16/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 725 6963: I did
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Sharmaine, In that case, I would like you to have a discussion with your family regarding the expenses, As the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
