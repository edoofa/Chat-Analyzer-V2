I believe edoofa will help me pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer and because I am a girl this will also encourage other girls that there is more to education. Edoofa accepting me into their program will also push other students to study hard so that they also get the opportunity which I would have been given.

16/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 952 8001: Because.. The mid terms  were not easy
16/12/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Moreblessing!
16/12/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
16/12/23, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

16/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 952 8001: No.. Before edoofa I had not thought of foreign education
16/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 952 8001: Ok
16/12/23, 11:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue
