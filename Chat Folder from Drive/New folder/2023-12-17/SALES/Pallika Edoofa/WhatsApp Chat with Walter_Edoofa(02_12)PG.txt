06/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 480 9500: A very good morning to you ma'am. My apologies today, l'm having a mathematics lesson till 2 o'clock in the afternoon and from there l will be ready for today's session
06/12/23, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know once available.
06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Afternoon ma'am l am now available

06/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this

07/12/23, 1:18 am - +263 78 480 9500: Well, l discussed the the financial aspect with my parents. So, from my own point of view it is really hard for them to cater for my tertiary education abroad but,with greater hopes maybe they will make ends meet but the probability of that is slim.

 For the financial strategy we have none for now but we will try to tackle the issue and come up with a solution.
07/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?

07/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I am good thanks and you?
07/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great!!
07/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 480 9500: That's good to hear
07/12/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses? <This message was edited>

11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Greetings ma'am I am ready for the session
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this.
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Well, l discussed with my family about it and they said it is hard for them to provide about $2000-$3000 per year
11/12/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Walter, But have you discussed about the EWYL Program that helps you to reduce your own tuition fees by making you self finance your own higher education!
11/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I did not discussed about that with them
11/12/23, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity and further students get a chance to self-finance their own higher education by working on the EWYL (earn while you learn) projects which allow you to earn 50-100$ worth scholarships every month that will reduce your tuition fees and lessen the burden on your parents.
11/12/23, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Don't you think it is beneficial!
11/12/23, 7:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you all are doing well today,

May I know if you are available for the session now?
12/12/23, 9:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Afternoon ma'am, sorry for the delays with my parents and they are not sure if the EWYL program is a sure thing to get, is it? If l join EWYL program how much will l earn per semester and how much will my tuition fee be reduced.
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Of course, it is beneficial.
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 480 9500: This is interesting and it is indeed of great help
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 480 9500: So basically what is the type of work that l will be doing
13/12/23, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
13/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Ok thank you ma'am now l do understand it all better
13/12/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Walter.
13/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, By seeing all these facts, Is your family willing to support you financially?
13/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 480 9500: They are both not using WhatsApp right now, so l tell them every detail about this program and these precious facts l'm pretty sure they are going to accept it and they will be willing to support me financially.
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, have you not discussed about the program with them yet?
13/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I did but not about these new facts like EWYL program and the outcomes of EWYL program.
13/12/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Walter, Please have a discussion with them once again and let me know if they will be able to manage the remaining expenses.
13/12/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I would like to share some glimpses of the school where you are currently having A level Harare High is one of our associate schools in Zimbabwe with the child of a Senior Teacher studying here in India through the Edoofa program
13/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Thank you ma'am. I will do that as soon as possible.
13/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Oh that is awesome thank you for the news
13/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 480 9500: No l don't know them when did they wrote their A Level examination, if it is not this year then l do not know any because l did my O level at Highfield High School not Harare High School.
13/12/23, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright
