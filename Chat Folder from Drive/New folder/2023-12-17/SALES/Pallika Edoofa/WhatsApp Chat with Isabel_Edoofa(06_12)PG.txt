I hope that you are doing well today.
07/12/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, then, Mr. Mpofu, Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Well I am civil servant working as a police officer and a father of four. My highest academic qualification is an Ordinary Level and a police graduate certificate which earned me employment into the civil service.  It has always been my dream to see my children surpass my status and scale higher levels of success in both academia and economic growth.
07/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Now that Isabel has completed her Advanced Level in secondary education, I wish that she soars again through tertiary education. Since she is a brilliant child let the sky be her limit.

Your unwavering support for your loved one is truly commendable. It's clear that you're doing everything possible to ensure their success, both morally and financially. The commitment and belief you express in their potential are invaluable. It's only natural to have concerns about the financial aspect, but your dedication and efforts are already making a significant difference. Remember that challenges may arise, but your steadfast support is a powerful force. Keep faith in your resilience, and I hope that everything falls into place for both you and your loved one.
07/12/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Although, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
07/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Thank you very much madam, God bless you
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!

07/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Okay I do understand madam, if I were to be given a choice I could have chosen 100% scholarship. However if it's about the board's recommendations then we will strive to meet the remaining costs
07/12/23, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
07/12/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moving forward, I kindly request that you share Isabel's O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for a more comprehensive overview.
07/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Okay I definitely will do that but right now I'm at work. It will be my first thing as I reach home
07/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, By what time will you be providing those?
07/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Just hold on, I'm trying to get them earlier dear
07/12/23, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Mpofu
07/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 324 7464: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 324 7464: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Mr. Mpofu, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
07/12/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 766 3634 joined using this group's invite link
07/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Nope, I'm just starting now
07/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 324 7464: Thank you once again for the awareness. Surveillance is not only my duty but my responsibility. Let's soar together under the eagle's eye. Please stay blessed
07/12/23, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Mpofu, Proceeding further, I would like to know that if Isabel wants to pursue Medicine, so Why she hasn't opted for Physics in A level?
07/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 324 7464: I think it was about the school which she enrolled with versus her personal strength and choice. However I do admit that it was due to lack of proper career guidance dear
07/12/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Mr. Mpofu, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
07/12/23, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Isabel does not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?

11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

11/12/23, 6:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand!! Ms. Moyo,

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?

11/12/23, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
