13/12/23, 5:20 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

15/12/23, 11:54 am - Tushti: Thank you, dear
15/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
15/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 302 5192: Yes it challenging for her but sometimes l am trying to help through vending as well but it’s still challenging

15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
