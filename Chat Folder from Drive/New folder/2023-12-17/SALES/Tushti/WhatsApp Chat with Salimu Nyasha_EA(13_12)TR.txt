15/12/23, 11:38 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 688 0015: Yes

Also do share the following details:

15/12/23, 2:55 pm - Tushti: Thank you, dear
15/12/23, 2:55 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
