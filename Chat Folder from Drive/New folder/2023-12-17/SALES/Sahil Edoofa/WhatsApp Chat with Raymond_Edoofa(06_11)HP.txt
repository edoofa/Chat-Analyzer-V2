We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Knowing a person better makes you communicate  better
09/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
09/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Well Raymond now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it is
As my future plans on education they are at a lesser extent supported by the Zimbabwean education system
09/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: You see, Raymond, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it is especially this side 
Its not the matter of education but its now the matter of who you know in the system or how much money do youhave
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Raymond.
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Would you say you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I can not say l am or am not as l do not know the way they survive on the orther side 
But dispite that as long as some one can survive there another person can
09/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand what you are sharing Raymond.

I believe this video must have helped, isn't it?
09/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it did
09/11/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
09/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes they are willing
But on the financial part l can not promise anything things are getting tougher as each day goes by
09/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

So how are you planning your higher education, Raymond?
09/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Still in progress as am trying to create a bridge before l arrive to cross the lake
09/11/23, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.

Meanwhile, may I know if you would agree that studying abroad would require financial support?
09/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes l agree
09/11/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: So what's your financial planning for higher education in India?
09/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I have none 
My family will not be able to afford it
09/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Raymond.
09/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
09/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Going for tertiary it's costly
09/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, so how are you planning your higher education even if you stay in Zimbabwe, Raymond?
09/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I was planning to go to air force since l can not afford tertiary
09/11/23, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Meanwhile, may I ask who supports your school education financially, Raymond?
09/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 634 7770: My parents
09/11/23, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

So aren't they willing to support you for your higher education along with the scholarship, Raymond? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 634 7770: They are willing but the financial status does not favour them 
I literally had to cry tears for them to understand why l had to go and learn my A Level at St Columba's
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand the situation Raymond.

So let me share a document with you, do go through the same and inform me once you have read it.
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Thank you
10/11/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

10/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
10/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
10/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 634 7770: 1.it is a program that offers scholarships based on the child's academics 
The interview that will be held will also contribute on the intake of the child
 
2.the financial aspect is based on how much percentage the Edoofian project has offered the child 
The child has to pay annually $2000-$3000 towards the education
10/11/23, 10:43 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

And did you discuss the details with your parents too?
11/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 634 7770: No have not

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

27/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand
27/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I understand 
I am confident
27/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
27/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Olevel results

01/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I see my self running my own company of programming all kinds of softwares 
Edoofa's program can enable me to achieve my dreams by helping my parents to cater for my educational needs as it a huge Boulder blocking my way to archieve my dreams 
It will build a stepping stone of zooming into the sky with graceful achievements <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Raymond, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Studying abroad constructs a foundation of my future 
Zimbabwe is not a developed country when it comes to technology which will hinder my progress as much things that l would have learnt will not be of use in the next coming 5 to 10 years as there is vast globalization in the technology sector in the universe
Also the employment standards in Zimbabwe are low and its hard to go out to another country with a Zimbabwean degree to look for a job <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: You see, Raymond, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 211 6543: That's what kill us
01/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Studying abroad is the chance to have a brighter future
01/12/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand and I am glad you are making efforts, Raymond

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
01/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 211 6543: One of the main strengths of the system is its emphasis on rote learning and memorization. This helps students to learn large amounts of information quickly and accurately. Another strength is the system's focus on practical learning, with many schools incorporating vocational training and hands-on learning. The system also has a strong emphasis on discipline and hard work, which helps students to develop a strong work ethic. Finally, the system's focus on traditional values and culture helps students to understand their heritage and history.
01/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness and knowledge, Raymond
01/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

01/12/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through all the resources, Raymond?

If so, did you find them helpful to learn more?
01/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes l did 
They were helpful
01/12/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Raymond

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Raymond
01/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 211 6543: No
01/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Okay
My battery is about to die and we do not have electricity <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: You can continue using your parents device in that case.
01/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 211 6543: My parants are not home yet
01/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: By when are they getting back please?
01/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Am not sure 
Lets countinue we will stop when it's dead
01/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
01/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 211 6543: What about the transport from Zimbabwe to india
01/12/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same, Raymond?
01/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 211 6543: It's good thing 
It enables creativity
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Raymond?
01/12/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Creative students can get to pay their own fees without their parents help
01/12/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Do you offer transport for students from Zimbabwe to india or they provide for them selves <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Raymond.
01/12/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Determination and hardwork makes the cut
01/12/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: While I would help you have a better clarity later in the process,

So far, are you clear that Edoofa assist with scholarship on Tuition fee itself?
01/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes it is clear
01/12/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
01/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
01/12/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
01/12/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Raymond? <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
01/12/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, now lets discuss the *Earn While You Learn Program* in detail!

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/12/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

01/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Are there some physical projects
01/12/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: No please, online projects itself!

You would be alloted a dedicated mentor while you are still in Zimbabwe.
01/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Okay 

Thank you that will be great
01/12/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
01/12/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 211 6543: This is wonderful it helps to relieve the pressure
01/12/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
01/12/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Raymond, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
01/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
01/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
01/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 211 6543: $1500-$2250
01/12/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/12/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/12/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes it does
01/12/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/12/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
01/12/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Okay
01/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I understand this part
01/12/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/12/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
01/12/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/12/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I am lost on step 5 on registration fee
01/12/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: This registration fee ($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee please, Raymond!
01/12/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 211 6543: What is it for
01/12/23, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: For students without Edoofa it's a separate fee.

For students with Edoofa it's adjusted with your tuition fee only.
01/12/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
01/12/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Can you please help me understand
01/12/23, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: What did you not understand please?
01/12/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 211 6543: How do the $350 feee and the ($500-$1000)link
01/12/23, 9:17 pm - Harmehak: For students without Edoofa registration fee is always a separate fee, Raymond.

When you apply for international education there is a registration fee as well.

However, for students who apply with Edoofa it's adjusted with your tuition fee only and is not a separate fee please.
01/12/23, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: They donot link,

$350 is your enrollment fee.

$500-1000 is registeration fee which is adjusted with your tuition fee only.
01/12/23, 9:20 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

01/12/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 211 6543: so there is $350 enrollment fee and ($500-$1000)for registration for education which is reduced when am part of edoofa <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 9:24 pm - Harmehak: *Raymond, $350 is the enrollment fee which includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program*

*While Registration fee is a part of your tuition fee only and is not a separate or extra fee, Raymond*
01/12/23, 9:24 pm - Harmehak: Are you clear so far?
01/12/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 211 6543: So registration is accounted by educational fees <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 9:27 pm - Harmehak: For example is your registration fee is $800 and your tuition fee is $2000.

For students without Edoofa it would be $800 plus $2000.

However for you, with Edoofa, if you pay your registration fee which is $800

Your tuition fee for the year would be 2000-800 which is $1200.

Are you clear now?
01/12/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
01/12/23, 9:30 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries?

Prepare for a series of interviews with *Mr. Sahil and the Director*, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as Mr. Sahil's time is valuable. He will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
01/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Thank you
02/12/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings to you Raymond Andile Magadi , Mr.Ronald Nhamo Magadi  and Mrs. Sibonisiwe Ndlovu

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
02/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
02/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
02/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 211 6543: The session was amazing
Yes all my questions were answered
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: ​​May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
02/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 211 6543: We discussed about the financial aspects,registration fee,enrollment fee and the course that am eligible to do 
They would like to ask about why do you consider a level subjects only when it comes to choosing careers
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Considering A-level subjects is often a crucial aspect of choosing careers because A-levels, or their equivalent, play a significant role in shaping a student's academic profile and specialization. Here's why they are given importance:
Reflect Specialization: Showcase specific academic interests.

Meet University Requirements: Many universities have subject-specific entry criteria.

Provide Foundation: Lay the groundwork for higher education.

Demonstrate Proficiency: Show expertise in chosen subjects.

While A-levels are crucial, a holistic approach, considering personal interests and long-term goals, ensures a well-rounded career decision.
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Any other questions do you have for me ?
02/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 211 6543: No
02/12/23, 2:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
02/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I haven't find the time to connect with her
02/12/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ask your parents to connect today and clear all their concerns .
02/12/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 211 6543: That's  lovely
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Will do

How are you doing today?
11/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Am great and you ?
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023 for $200 and the 17th  or 18th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 211 6543: May l please confirm this later
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Parents have to answer this.
