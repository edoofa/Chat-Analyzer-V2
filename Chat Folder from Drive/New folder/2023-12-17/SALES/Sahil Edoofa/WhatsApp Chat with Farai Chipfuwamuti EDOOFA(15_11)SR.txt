28/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Ok thank you... let me through it
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?.
28/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 143 5949: From what i just read I understood something, that I think it's lacking in my country, that is ICT. I think by studying in India, I will achieve my goal since the world is changing almost everyday.As I was going through the  pictures I was happy to see people on computers and on top conner was written Business insider India. So, it shows that if study in India I can achieve my goals.
28/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Im also happy to see that India has also prioritized English as it's  local language. I'm not good at English and I hope if I go to India I will be good enough, even to speak with others business partners around the world face to face. You know to be good business man, you be an expert in communication skills
29/11/23, 11:34 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
29/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm doing great sir. How are you?
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing 
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I don't actually know the exact figure, but with the quality of education offered, I think it's expensive
29/11/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Honestly, I don't think so
30/11/23, 7:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: What specific aspect of this is financially challenging for your family? Moreover, given the overall high cost of education, do you know the monthly budget your parents have set aside for your education, even within your own country?
30/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 143 5949: It's hard to make such a budget because my mom's income is not fixed
30/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir , and you
30/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I can understand but she might have set some budget ?
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yea .. maybe she may set 100 usd and on top of that I have two siblings behind me
30/11/23, 7:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Thats $1200 annually right ?
30/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 143 5949: ..yes sir
01/12/23, 11:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: So what about food and accommodation ?
01/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 143 5949: ..we have a house
01/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Money for other basic needs , we get it from rent and   my uncle usually assist us
01/12/23, 5:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How far is university from your home ?
02/12/23, 6:17 am - +263 78 143 5949: . about 200km
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Kindly excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the academic board.

So shall we start your session now ?
02/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir . Sure
02/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So you have to stay there right , How much will it cost you to stay there and what about food electricity ?
02/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I think all those cost may not exceed 200usd , especially when u staying on campus
02/12/23, 4:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Per month right ?
02/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yes sir
02/12/23, 4:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: And how much is that annually ?
02/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 143 5949: That should be 2000usd because there are two months for holiday
02/12/23, 5:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now add this cost
02/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 143 5949: It's 3200usd
02/12/23, 5:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So I hope you understand that way more than cost of studying abroad after scholarship
02/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yea ...I see
02/12/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your family calculated thing like this ever ?
02/12/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 143 5949: No sir
04/12/23, 10:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: So did you share this with your family now ?
04/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 143 5949: ..yes sir
04/12/23, 12:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So what were their views on the same ?
04/12/23, 12:52 pm - +27 65 666 8573: We will take it in consideration and advice 🙏
04/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's great to know. Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
04/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I don't know how it's done ... Can you please explain on that one
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
05/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir . How are you too?
05/12/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please answer this
06/12/23, 12:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session tomorrow at 10:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation
06/12/23, 5:41 am - +263 78 143 5949: Ok sir I was a little busy and I couldn't read and understand. But now I'm okay
06/12/23, 7:32 am - +263 78 143 5949: On that one , I think  it will benefit a student to get a job very fast , since all organisations take experience as an advantage during recruitment.
06/12/23, 11:15 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
06/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir .
06/12/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
06/12/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
06/12/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
06/12/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

06/12/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can see this even in the above-shared scholarship credit certificates where our star performers, our *Proud Edoofians* like Miriam earned *$2618* within a time span of a year. Well, this was only possible for them to earn a handsome amount of scholarship credits because they were constantly in touch with their mentors for their skill development, and repeatedly asked for more projects and assignments to be done, which in return helped her to earn such an amount of scholarship credits in a year.

I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure of your parents?
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I can understand how EWYL program help to cover tuition fees, accommodation, food ,etc
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I prefer employability through practical training, because will be applying what are learning,  in a real life situation which happens to be maybe difficult but will make it easier for us in the long run
07/12/23, 11:41 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/12/23, 6:14 am - +263 78 143 5949: How are sir?
08/12/23, 11:15 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/12/23, 9:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session     

Stay Blessed!
09/12/23, 7:19 am - +263 78 143 5949: How are sir?
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings to you
How are you doing today?
Kindly excuse me for the delay there is some issue with my device today.
09/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir. I can understand that
09/12/23, 1:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
09/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I think Earn While You Learn, makes students to save such amounts
09/12/23, 4:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
09/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Honestly I'm not sure... I didn't know that
09/12/23, 4:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I don't know
09/12/23, 6:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 10:30 am CAT time Monday to resume your session     

Stay Blessed!
11/12/23, 12:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
11/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir. How are you too?
11/12/23, 1:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
11/12/23, 1:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
11/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 143 5949: ..for five colleges the minimum would be 750 usd
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Ummm ...on that one I'm sure but what I know here in Zimbabwe it's difficult to get a scholarship so I don't think there be any assurance
11/12/23, 3:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
11/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yes I think so and I'm optimistic about that
11/12/23, 4:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
11/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yeah. It's actually an application written by an applicant looking for a place at a college or university
11/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 143 5949: The application will be focused on why  he /she wants that degree or diploma and how it's going to benefit him/her
11/12/23, 6:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
11/12/23, 8:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 143 5949: ..yes sir
12/12/23, 11:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
12/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir . How are you too?
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 143 5949: For SOP that will be $600-$1000 ,
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/12/23, 3:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I'm good sir. How is your day
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

14/12/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 143 5949: Morning sir

14/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 143 5949: For now I'm in stage 1 which includes personalized , counseling session
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 143 5949: Yes sir
14/12/23, 4:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: By when will you submit your A level ?
14/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 143 5949: I hope early January, they will be out
14/12/23, 6:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
15/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 143 5949: Yeah. It's clear sir

15/12/23, 8:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-
