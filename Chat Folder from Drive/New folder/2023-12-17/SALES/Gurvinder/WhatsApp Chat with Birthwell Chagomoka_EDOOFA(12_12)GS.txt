12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 73 815 1871: I have learnt that the Edoofa program was initiated by Anhad  Edutrain Solutions Pvt, . Ltd , lndia. The Edoofa believes that quality education should be accessible to all and not just privilege of a few. Through their scholarship program that is based on work study model, Edoofa solves problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from the building the application, applying to colleges, training and making them job ready. That's all l have learnt
12/12/23, 6:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

14/12/23, 7:44 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 7:45 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
15/12/23, 7:40 am - +263 73 815 1871: I'm sorry Mr Gurvinder we had serious power cuts here but everything is ok now
15/12/23, 7:59 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 8:00 am - +263 73 815 1871: Good morning Sir
15/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: I understand your issue, but please try to inform me that you cannot participate by giving a valid reason as I cannot know if you have a valid problem or you just can't reach to me.
15/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 73 815 1871: Ok Sir
15/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: I see you are well informed, Birthwell.
15/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 73 815 1871: Yes that's it
15/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Birthwell, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 73 815 1871: Yes l think so
15/12/23, 7:51 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 73 815 1871: Ok sir
16/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

16/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 73 815 1871: Morning sir
16/12/23, 8:04 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!
