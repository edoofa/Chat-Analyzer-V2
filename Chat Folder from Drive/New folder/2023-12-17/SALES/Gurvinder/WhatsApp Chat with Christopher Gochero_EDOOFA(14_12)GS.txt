*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
14/12/23, 7:52 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

15/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Christopher,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 597 4800: It's an honor for me to be talking to you as well
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder
15/12/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Christopher, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Auxillia, is that correct?

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/12/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
16/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 597 4800: Mr Gurvinder, forgive my absence, the network reliability this side is poor so it's really tough to connect, and I really want to talk about the opportunity ahead of me with you, sir. I have relatives in Madokero who can make this easier so on Tuesday I'm going there and I will make sure that by ten I will start chatting with you, if you're comfortable we can even make a video call because they have wifi over there
