*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Gerald Chirombo.

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

16/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I learnt that at Edoofa we share an aim to make quality higher education accessible, affordable and most importantly employment oriented so that more and more students can pursue their dreams.
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have awareness, Gerald.
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay thank you so much Mrs Harmehak for the educative information
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes we are already finacially challenged at home so l am looking forward to such opportunities
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Gerald, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mazowe high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I am a boy aged 18. I live in Southerton, Harare. I finished writing my upper 6 final exams last month. Both my parents are still alive and we live together, both my parents are self employed . My father drives lorries for a living and my mother runs a canteen near the industries in my area. They both stopped schooling after A level. I am the third born child having an older sister who stopped schooling after finishing A level, the second one is currently at Women's University right now doing her first year, and two other younger siblings in primary school. I did my form 1 to 6 at Mazowe where our termly boarding fees was 500USD . l passed my O levels with 7A's and 4 B's and went on to do my A levels. I was a very active student in all my disciplines at school and had several leadership roles like Leo Club president, Scripture Union Vice Chairman, and School Head boy. Despite having challenges financially at home and going to school short of fees sometimes, l managed to pull through. I intend to become an electrical engineer and pursue my education further outside the country
