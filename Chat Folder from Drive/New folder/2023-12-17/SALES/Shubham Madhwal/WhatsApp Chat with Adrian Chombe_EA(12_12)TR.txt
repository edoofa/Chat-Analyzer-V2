12/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 949 1278: No l have limited knowledge on the program as l encountered it in some of my school educational groups hence l applied
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me give you a brief introduction to the Program you have applied for
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School.

12/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Sorry typing error
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Tushti: Noted
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Yh it's all over Zimbabwe
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Studying abroad currently is preferable because it has a better employment rate than Zimbabwe currently
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 949 1278: In  addition one can gain skills and ideas abroad that can be used in the developing own community  and country
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Tushti: I see

12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 949 1278: I have come to know that India is  emerging as the world's education hub with high technological equipment  and other resources. I would like to specialise in cyber security and digital enforcement  laws thus my desire to study there
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - Tushti: Very well researched Adrian. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

12/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Ok
12/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Interesting
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
12/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 949 1278: No l am not familiar with the cost
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: In simple words Adrian, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Good to hear
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: I would like to have your parents' opinion on this as ewll
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Ok
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: Ask them to come online, please
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Ok
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 405 5496: Good afternoon.  I was not aware of the fees structure. But it's good to know about the scholarship and all it's  advantages. I fully support Adrian in his endeavours and  what he intends to study
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Great
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
12/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Yh it's something I have been looking for
12/12/23, 3:51 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
12/12/23, 3:51 pm - Tushti: Adrian, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Over $1500
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: Exactly Adrian, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 949 1278: This is nice
12/12/23, 3:59 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 3:59 pm - Tushti: Adrian, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Okay
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 949 1278: Yes

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage

d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy

b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.


3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means

c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.


5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.

7.can pollute waterways

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

The assertion is true but to a lesser extent. This is so because climate change is also having it's toll, migrations into developed countries, inflation, sanctions, unemployment, strikes by workers who provide basic services, ineffectient machinery, pests destroying plantations, only to mention a few.However, it would be an abortion of facts to cast a blind eye on the impact of stagnant and ineffectient farms in promoting poor diets in Africa. It is therefore the purpose of this essay to elaborate further on the points stated above in detail.

To commence, the verdict that many Africans have poor diets because of stagnant and ineffectient farms is true to a lesser extent as other factors have also a hand in implementing this problem. For instance, inflation, this has began now become a daily bread for Africans as price are consistently going up over their main prices. The issue arises when one's income does increase at the pace the price of basic commodities is rising with. This leaves with no other alternative except having unbalanced meals without enough nutrients. Hence, inflation causing poor diets.
Furthermore, sanctions are also contributing to Africans having poor diets. Most African countries like Zimbabwe for example, cannot trade with other countries because of these sanctions this leaves such countries with little choice of looking for a country that would act as it's middleman in trading with other countries, this option means reduction in the profit margins or even spiralling down into a loss, the other alternative would be to learn to adapt without that certain commodity. Thus, leading to poor diets in Africa.
Moreover, poor dieting in Africa is caused by the increase in unemployment rates. Many Africans study and graduate with decorative degrees but they are left unable to acquire a job because the number of people in need of jobs has outrightly surpassed the number of jobs available. The increase in technology has also worsened this grievance as it's now replacing some humans. For example some farmers now use tractors to plough instead of using hired help. Therefore, the lack of employment in Africa is also playing a significant role in causing poor dieting.
To add more, poor dieting is being pushed for by the frequent climate change in Africa and argues with the view that poor dieting in Africa is caused by stagnant and ineffectient farms. Africans are failing to keep with climate changes as it still remains a big opponent in disturbing the daily strive of Africans for a better tomorrow. Heatwaves come and destroy crops also diminishing one's health; cyclones come from the other direction and leave one homeless. Thus, clearly climate is a factor of poor dieting in Africa.
In addition, Africa is succumbing to poor dieting because of some strikes in and around the countries in the nation. Some worker are forced to strike because of poor pays and poor working conditions. These strikes are a fatal blow as they become a hindrance in the running of some day to day activities which a country depends on so as to keep the economy on its feet. For example medical practitioners like doctors go on strikes most of the time so that the government hears their pleas but this has a dangerous effect on the patients who may require their services and this may prove to be fatal. Thus, strikes are also a cause of poor diets in Africa.
However, it is would be an abortion of facts to outlook the role played by stagnant and ineffectient farms in causing poor diets in Africa. Some farms in Africa are failing to produce the expected yields which is deposited in granaries for the country's disposal. A shortage in the harvest simply means a shortage of that product in the country or continent. This leaves citizens of that particular nation to improvise and adapt to living with that basic product and in the end one is forced to have a poor diet. Therefore, poor diets in Africa are also caused by stagnant and ineffectient farms though to a lesser extent.
Conclusively, yes stagnant and ineffectient farms contribute in the consumption of poor but to a lesser extent as compared to the contribution of other factors like inflation, unemployment, strikes, climate change, and sanctions.

"My Inspirational Story"
My inspirational story is about how l passed my Ordinary level exams. I was learning at a boarding school called St Francis of Assisi in Chivhu. We supposed to start the ZIMSEC exams in December, although usually they started in October but it was not an ordinary year as COVID-19 had brought about it's changes. In November, a month before I started my exams l lost my notes for all of my subjects, to this day l have no idea where they went but I suspected that somebody was messing with me. Had l found the culprit, l wanted to beat him or her black and blue so that they would know l was one to mess with. Luck proved not to be on my side as l did not manage to find any one of my notes for the twelve subjects that l was pursuing at the time.
From a young age l had taught myself never to cry over spilled milk, so l licked my wounds and joined any of my classmates who happened to be discussing any particular subject. This way l got to know some things l did not know already so the eavesdropping was paying off. At first some of my classmates saw it strange because l was much a socially active person but they got used to it with days passing on. It became a daily routine of joining these discussion groups whether invited or not till the day l finished all my papers.
When my mother came to pick me up at school, l did not tell her of my endeavors because l suspected she would not buy it but probably think it as one of my invented lies. The holiday was quite long while the papers were being marked needless to say that l did not enjoy it as l feared the day of the results coming out with each day passing out quickly. The day the results came out, l could not log into the ZIMSEC portal so l asked my Dad to log in for me although l did not love the idea that was the only option I had. Upon logging into the portal my Dad called quickly called me as he was not home at the time. I remember my heart beating faster than normal, l feared answering his call because it was either l passed or failed type of situation without space for average. Reluctantly, l answered only to receive one of the best news l have received in my life. I had passed more than I expected, 4As,7Bs and 1D. The D was in Literature but I did not care as l focused on the other 11 passed subjects. That's my inspirational story, the passing of my ordinary level without notes.
