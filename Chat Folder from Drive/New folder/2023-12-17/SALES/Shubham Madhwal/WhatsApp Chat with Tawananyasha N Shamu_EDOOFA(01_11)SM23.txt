07/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 957 1111: I'm back now
07/11/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
07/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 957 1111: yes I'm now available
07/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please why have you been inactive for your sessions lately?
07/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
08/11/23, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Tawananyasha, How are you?
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
