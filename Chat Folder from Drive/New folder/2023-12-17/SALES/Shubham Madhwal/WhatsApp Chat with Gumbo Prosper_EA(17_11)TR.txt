18/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 831 7766: Mam
18/11/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: Noted
18/11/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: May I know whether your twin, too has applied to Edoofa?
18/11/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 831 7766: No she doesn't. Apply
18/11/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: Would she not proceed with tertiary education, like you?
18/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 831 7766: Yes mam
18/11/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: So she would complete her education in Zimbabwe?
18/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 831 7766: Yes mam
18/11/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: I would like to understand why you both have taken such diametrically different decisions regarding your future?
18/11/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 831 7766: She wanted to take the short way
18/11/23, 11:23 am - Tushti: I did not understand

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
