Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

05/12/23, 6:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - +260 97 7410550: Noted with thanks
06/12/23, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 97 7410550: Of course
06/12/23, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session.
06/12/23, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
06/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 97 7410550: It is a scholarship program that has been set to help the financially unstable
06/12/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

06/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
06/12/23, 9:06 pm - +260 97 7410550: Yes
06/12/23, 9:06 pm - +260 97 7410550: Indeed I am
06/12/23, 9:09 pm - +260 97 7410550: Your consideration will be highly appreciated
07/12/23, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

08/12/23, 7:10 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 97 7410550: Indeed
09/12/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Inambao christabel,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/12/23, 11:47 am - +260 97 7410550: Mr Gurvinder we may proceed
09/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs. Christabel, as we start Sibuyunji's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
09/12/23, 12:02 pm - +260 97 7410550: Please proceed
09/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
09/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 7410550: Yes of course
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs. Christabel, I would like to know Sibuyunji better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
