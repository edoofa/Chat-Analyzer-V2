08/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Prig A, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, is that correct?
08/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  its 100% correct sir
08/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kudakwashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 437 5439: Okay,  firstly l can say l learnt that Edoofa is a scholarship program  that offers affordable  fees to its students and makes them to achieve they dreams through  good education  in India.  Basically  from my friend  Kudakwashe's journey  there l learnt that l too can do it.
08/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Prig A, good education certainly is important to achieve what you dream.
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  sir that my dream too since l was young
08/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Prig A, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  sir l am ready to go
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 406 6067: Parents  too are present and are for the idea
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 344 3262: Well supported and  highly appreciate the scholarship
08/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of responsibility towards your child @263773443262 @263774066067 .
08/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now Prig A, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

08/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 437 5439: During my  primary education,  our school was located  near a hospital. My grade 7 teacher took us for an educational  tour to the dental unit.  The dentists  took her time to talk with us how the dental unit operates.  Soon after the tour l had a tooth injury. I went back to  the some dentist and she managered to restore  my broken tooth . From there l was assisted by the pharmacist to get the  prescribed  medication.At the pharmacy l admired  the following  things
 1. Order in the pharmacy
2.the way the tablets were given me using a computer. 
3 the way the pharmacist  was dressed and his ability  to interpret  what was written  on the my card.

09/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these two fields?
09/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 406 6067: One of  his cousin sister is a Pharmacist and also a cousin bother who is a Medical doctor in Usa
09/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 437 5439: Yes there is one brother  who is a Medical  doctor in USA
09/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
09/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 437 5439: null
09/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 437 5439: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 437 5439: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 437 5439: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 437 5439: These are my lower six results
09/12/23, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Prig A, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*, But your interest in doing Pharmacy is still achievable but I need an assurance that you will achieve best grades in Chemistry in your A-level exams.
09/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 437 5439: Okay sir,  in chemistry  we didn't  have a teacher  so the whole lower six course so my assurance  is 50% but l believe that l can do it better if God allows..
09/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*
09/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 437 5439: Thank you l do like it since my childhood.
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 437 5439: Yes l do
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 437 5439: Yes sir thank  you
09/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!
