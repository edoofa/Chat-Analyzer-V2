04/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 776 6715: Yes sir thats correct
04/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kudzai, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kudzai’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 776 6715: I learnt that Edoofa is a Program that is there assist everyone who is bright academically  as well as the talented.Edoofa is there to solve affordability  in terms  of acquiring education..As well as to assist students who excel to get job opportunities after one has has finished their courses...



As well Edoofa from Kudzai Edoofa offers 50-100percent scholarship to brilliant students depending on the quantum  ( level percentage )
04/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 776 6715: From what i have learnt from Kudzai Edoofa is a reliable program that does not only help in getting admission but it assists throughout the course of learning till one finishes their course
04/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, I see you are well informed.
04/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Still I will brief you about the program myself.
04/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 776 6715: It is likewise sir
04/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 776 6715: This is an opportunity i am looking for
04/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Samathar, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 776 6715: I do believe that i have what it takes to get a higher quantum sir
04/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Samathar, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 776 6715: Samathar is a young lady that has done her Ordinary level and Advanced level at Seke 1 High here in Zimbabwe

During my Ordinary level i managed to come up with 6 subjects and i proceeded to Advanced level in which i had 14 points doing Arts Subjects.

While growing up i have always desired to study law and fortunately the subjects i did were in line with law.To me Law is not just a profession or career i want to do randomly but it is a part of me .I feel that my purpose is to help others that cannot speak for themselves. I have grown to have a strong desire to be that voice to the voiceless.To stand in gap for them in a possible way i can and studying law i see it as the way to go.

My strength is in helping others.Putting a smile on the shattered and broken.My strength is bringing out a sense of belonging to others and due to the fact that Law tackles many areas i desire to proceed.My greatest weakness is not giving up even when i fail to achieve my goals.I believe in trying and putting more efforts in every step of the way

I
04/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 776 6715: My hobbies are writing short stories, poetry as well as singing on my spare time.Music helps me to come alive and gives a positive energy and writing helps me set out my emotions n feelings.

04/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

With all being said and done i hope that i find the favor to be privileged to proceed to University level without any blockades.Financially , Edoofa i trust it to be the right foundation to assist me let out my capabilities since now we are facing financial constraints that made me to take a gap year this year..

I would like to pursue Legislative Law .Law has always been my number one dream that i wish to come to fruition.

I have two twin brothers .They are in form 3 .My mother is a vendor and father is into construction but they are seperated.My mother couldn't proceed to write her Ordinary level and my father completed his Ordinary level thus being jis highest level..Throughout i was assisted by my aunty where she could help out .Abroad im looking forward to be assisted by a few relatives but it is not guaranteed as they have some responsibilities to handle in their homes.
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Law, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 776 6715: While i was growing up i have seen so many people that had issues they couldn't face on their own because of fear of the unknown outcomes.So many individuals can't come out to the open they remain taciturned but taking a closer introspection of myself and personality i felt the need to stand in gap.Studying law has been my number 1 goal .The people that surrounded me also became a much more catapult to this ambition.Also to clear the misunderstandings and negative theories that people that study law are corrupt and not rightsanding.I believed that i had a purpose and if i am to trace it back and forth ,Studying Law has always been the way <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 776 6715: As said earlier .Law is a part of me .Its not just a mere profession.It defines who i am.

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 776 6715: Noted
06/12/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 776 6715: I am confident
06/12/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the course?
06/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 776 6715: If i am  not mistaken you sent me a brief background about Legislative Law as u recommend it to be a suitable course that i can do
06/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: Excuse me, that was meant for some other student.
06/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 776 6715: Ooh really okay sir .There has been a miscommunication i guess
06/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
06/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 776 6715: Studying abroad to me is a platform in which i can increase my capacity to be that graduate i vision myself to be.And as a country that was affected during the covid period a lot has not fallen into place and it hasn't gotten on its feet to provide some scholarships for students that are facing financial contraints.Apart from that the scholarship on its own is from abroad and its helping my country to nature a future leader from my domain.This scholarship is only found once in a lifetime and i feel that accepting assistance from abroad is wise since its a rare opportunity.
06/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 776 6715: I believe that once i achieve the educational level i desire i will be equiped with the knowledge and capacity to assist brilliant students that are facing financial contraints get scholarships.As well bring innovative ideas  and projects that students from my country can embark on so to help them solve financial issues.In that way they can be able to proceed to to University level without hinderances independently.

As well Hosting entrepreneurship program's that can be an eye opener to students on how they can earn while they learn as i believe that i too will be highlighted on how it all flows
06/12/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Samathar, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 776 6715: I agree
06/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 776 6715: And i trust that conducive environment can be made possible by Edoofa program
06/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 776 6715: It is so .Please elaborate why it is so sir
06/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

06/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: So now Samathar, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 776 6715: So far i have no questions
06/12/23, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 776 6715: No we are not please highlight
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 776 6715: Ok following
06/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Samathar, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 776 6715: Ok noted
06/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 7:13 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

08/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Samathar, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 776 6715: Okay following
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

08/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
08/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 776 6715: I think it would benefit much as it confers a lifetime skill
08/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Samathar, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 776 6715: Noted sir
08/12/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
08/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 776 6715: It is what i am looking for
08/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 776 6715: Im inspired
08/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 776 6715: I have a question sir.Is there any possibility of working to get admission lets say one has had the scholarship
08/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Please elaborate your question, Samathar.
08/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 776 6715: I mean since Edoofa  helps the reduction of fees and Accommodation..Is there  a possibility for a prospective candidate to start the Learn while you earn program to cover the needed amount
08/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL program starts when you enroll with the Edoofa Program before even you get the admission acceptance letter, I will address this concern elaborately ahead in the counselling session too.
08/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 776 6715: Ok sir
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Samathar, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 776 6715: Yes i have understood that
08/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Samathar, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 776 6715: I believe so
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
08/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 776 6715: I have sir
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 776 6715: Yes i am ready
08/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Samathar, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 776 6715: $1500-$2 200
08/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Samathar, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 776 6715: Okay noted
08/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 776 6715: My phone's battery is low its about to be off
08/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
08/12/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 776 6715: Yes i do thank so
09/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 776 6715: I ran out of power
09/12/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,

09/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 776 6715: Following
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Samathar, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 776 6715: Following
09/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 776 6715: Understood
09/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 776 6715: No im not
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Samathar, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 776 6715: I have sir
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 776 6715: No questions yet but if any arises i will ask
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-
