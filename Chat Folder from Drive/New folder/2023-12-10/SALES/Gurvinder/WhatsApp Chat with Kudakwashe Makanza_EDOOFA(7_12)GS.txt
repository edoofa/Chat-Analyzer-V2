08/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 697 5377: thank you Sir
08/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Kudakwashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Fungai, is that correct?
08/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 697 5377: No l got to know about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe or James .
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Simbarashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 697 5377: So Edoofa is a revolutionionary intiative that aims to provide education opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the glode .  
Some of the benefits of Edoofa are that it offers internships and industry oriented training through live projects
* Students have a lifelong alumni membership and opportunities for employment and outplace.
 *Edoofa has EWYL  which helps students to get internship opportunities from influential organisations, they also gain experience and Skill building.
Simbarashe's journey with Edoofa have been nothing but great . Edoofa helped him since day 1 and upto now . They have been taking care of him even in  hard times .
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, Kudakwashe.
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes it is
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kudakwashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l think l have what it takes.
08/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kudakwashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 236 8597: Hello
09/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Hello, Mrs.Nyachowe, how are you?
09/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 697 5377: Ready to continue
09/12/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. Agriculture*
09/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 236 8597: Ooh ok
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 697 5377: Noted  . That would be great
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 697 5377: Very confident about achieving it  Sir.
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes Sir
09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Go ahead Sir...
09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Kudakwashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted ✅.
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.
