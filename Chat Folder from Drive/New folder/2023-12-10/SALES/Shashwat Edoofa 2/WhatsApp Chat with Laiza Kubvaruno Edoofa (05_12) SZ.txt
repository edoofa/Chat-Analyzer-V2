09/12/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 947 4887: Instead of physics I did Maths
09/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 947 4887: That's what it is here in Zimbabwe for example at University of Zimbabwe they require math biology and chemistry so that you qualify in studying medicine there that's why I did no do physics
09/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 947 4887: So what happens if u don't have physics at A level
09/12/23, 11:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Laiza. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
09/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 71 947 4887: Yes u can
09/12/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

09/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your admirable desire to help people facing health challenges, particularly breast cancer, reflects a compassionate and caring nature.
