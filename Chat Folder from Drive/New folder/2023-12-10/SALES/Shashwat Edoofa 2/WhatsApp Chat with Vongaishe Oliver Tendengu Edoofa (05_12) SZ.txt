I did my primary level to different types of schools because my father as Pastor moved from one place to another as a minister of religion.

 I have did four subjects at Zimsec and got the following results:

My father is a Pastor of the United Methodist Church and my mother is a teacher by profession teaching at Sagambe High School.  If l look at the income capacity of my parents , it's at the lowest ebb. Catering for my fees at one the best Universities so as to pursue for my career seemed to be a burden to them. Apart from that l have my young brother Vimbainashe Emmanuel Tendengu who will be doing form four next year 2024 at First Clast Academy so my parents have mounting pressures of these fees in my family.  That's why l have found interest in Edoofa Scholarships such that my dream will be fulfilled here.  I am in need of help so that l will pursue with my studies and do Acturial Science.
