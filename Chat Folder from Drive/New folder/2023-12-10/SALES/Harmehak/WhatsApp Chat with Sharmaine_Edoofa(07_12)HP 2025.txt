07/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 656 5096: Can I ask what is it makes a student worthy of a presidential scholarship
07/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 656 5096: And do arts students have access to 100 % scholarships
07/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a Presidential Scholarship?
07/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 656 5096: From my own understanding it is a scholarship that covers full cost of  tuition,fees and accomodation
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: Okay thank you very much Ms Harmehak
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: Now I understand
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: That Edoofa also make education affordable
07/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Yes please
07/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
07/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 656 5096: Ms Harmehak can you please explain further on merits
07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 656 5096: And what are the extra curricular activities

07/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes
07/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Sharmaine, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mutare Girls high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 656 5096: My name is Sharmaine Olline Mabvuu, I'm seventeen years old, born and bred in Zimbabwe. I am an art student at Mutare girls high paying 100 USD per term.I wish to study law in the justice sector but I'm still at cahoots with myself whether I should study law or real estate agency , trying to figure out which job would be worker friendly and also considering that I'm a young lady who will grow up to be a mother one day . I'm a good debater and for the past years I've managed to walk away with certificates and medals in competitions which include HIDC, SECTA and ORATE so I can proudly say public speaking is my strength although I have weaknesses in the social field, I'm an introvert and more of a closeted lady. I enjoy reading novels and listening to music during my spare time and also writing poetry because I believe that life itself is a work of Art. I have an older brother studying chemical engineering at Midlands state university after he had accomplished 15 points in mathematics, physics and chemistry at Hartzerll high , My father works for ZESA as a civil contractor. I'm a very dedicated and hard working student driven by my aspirations, hopes and dreams and I'm hoping Edoofa can be my road to success.
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Sharmaine, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your parents?
07/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 656 5096: My father works for ZESA and he wrote his o level exams at Mt selinda and studied civil engineering at Harare polytechnic college, my mother was a pharmacist
07/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Thank you 🤝
07/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: I am sorry for your loss, Sharmaine.
07/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Thank you very much
07/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: So Sharmaine, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I believe it's a life changing decision indeed
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I am very it has always been my dream since the start of high school to study abroad. I believe that you have to be willing to get out of your cormfort zone to reach your full potential <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Sharmaine, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes they are I have told them and they said there'd be willing to support me if it's affordable
07/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I understand, Sharmaine
07/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I am and I promise to deliver the best
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 656 5096: This term I managed to get 11 points
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 656 5096: And I believe next year I will improve
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, that's the spirit
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 656 5096: <Media omitted>

What motivates you to study both?

07/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes please

08/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I did
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 656 5096: Ms Harmehak can I please have a list of the most paying jobs for art students
08/12/23, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Sharmaine, as per your interests both Law and Business Administration are well paying fields please.
08/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 656 5096: What about journalism
08/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 656 5096: Okay thank you very much I agree
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Harmehak: You can surely pursue the same, Sharmaine.
08/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 656 5096: Thank you Ms Harmehak I really do appreciate the guidance
08/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

So which course would you like to pursue?
08/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 656 5096: Bachelor of Legislative law
08/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 656 5096: Lawyer
08/12/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Alright Sharmaine, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 656 5096: Since it requires 5 years of study I believe by the time I reach my final year I would have learned more about the program since education has no end , I also believe I would have already managed to get my own clients and be able to bring justice awareness firstly on the campus and the world at large
08/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 656 5096: I believe Edoofa will help me through the earn while you learn program through that I can master entrepreneurship skills and I also believe I would have gained exposure through the Edoofian experience since law itself requires exposure
08/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: That is really great Sharmaine, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 656 5096: I believe that I won't be able to grow if I'm still in my cormfort zone plus Zimbabwe really does not have broad opportunities for art students
08/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 656 5096: I believe if I study abroad I will also make a positive mark in my society and also set a good example for other art students in Zimbabwe who have lost hope
08/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Its great that you are willing to put efforts, Sharmaine!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

08/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 656 5096: According to my research I have also learnt that the Indian education system offers high standards at an affordable cost and that it also focuses on the growth of the student on both the academic and non- academic sector
08/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 656 5096: Therefore I believe that studying in India will help me grow academically , mentally and socially

08/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 656 5096: Ms Harmehak does  Edoofa allow a student to venture into other businesses whilst learning
08/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I would share more regarding the programs and webinars while discussing the Earn While You Learn Program.
08/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes please
08/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 656 5096: Im not quite familiar with the costs of studying in India
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Alright please
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 656 5096: Okay thank you very much Ms Harmehak this is surely affordable
08/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 656 5096: So  these costs will be able to cover everything
08/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: In simple words Sharmaine, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 656 5096: So the cost 1200 -1800 will cover all these necessities for a year
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 656 5096: Understood
08/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Yes please, tuition fee(if any), Accomodation, Food, Basic University Expenses will all be covered.
08/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 656 5096: That's great 🤝
08/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Indeed please
08/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Sharmaine, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 656 5096: I do agree tertiary education is quite expensive in Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Sharmaine?
08/12/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Sharmaine.
08/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I am
08/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 656 5096: Apologies Ms Harmehak my network is a bit challenging
08/12/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I understand
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 656 5096: So through the earn while you learn program I get credits to help my parents with payment of tuition at the same I get an opportunity to learn about business as well <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 656 5096: Understandable
08/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
08/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 656 5096: Ms Harmehak can I ask how exactly a students can get credits besides excelling in her school work
08/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 656 5096: Noted
08/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
08/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes now it's clear thank you🤝
08/12/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
08/12/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I do Edoofa is quite different from other scholarship programs
08/12/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Indeed, did you follow the shared pictures and video?
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I did
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I am
08/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Sharmaine, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 656 5096: $2250
08/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: You see Sharmaine, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I do
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Understood
08/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 656 5096: The 350 is required before the final results are out
08/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 656 5096: And will it be suitable to make the payments whilst I'm waiting for my results next year
08/12/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: The payments are made after you are found eligible for the program and you receive an acceptance letter on the basis of your previous term's results.
08/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
08/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Okay understood
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Fair enough
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I did
08/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

08/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.
