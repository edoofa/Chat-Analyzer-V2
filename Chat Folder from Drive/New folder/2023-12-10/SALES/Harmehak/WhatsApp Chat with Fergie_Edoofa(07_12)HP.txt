From Mr Mudenda I've learnt many things. Such as  self dependent and He also guided me in choosing career.
07/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: That's great, I am glad you had a thorough discussion.

Did you happen to read the document shared with you earlier?
07/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yah I did, but not the whole of it.
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: I understand.
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 738 6311: thank you
07/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yes , it is.
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Fergie, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Tafara 1 high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I am the firstborn child in a family of six children. I was raised in Tafara. For my primary education, I attended Mwanandishe Primary then Tafara 1 High School. Being the eldest child in my family I had an early sense of commitment that was to look after my siblings. My mother works as a teacher at Mwanandishe Primary School. Life has never been easy for my family in terms of finances especially when the school feels hiked to $180 from $90. After my father died in 2019 I was forced to learn in debt. Mashambanzou Care Trust chartered for my fees until I finished my ordinary level which I passed with flying colors.

Driven by an impoverished way of life, I had to carefully make financial calculations hence I discovered my passion for arithmetics. At the advanced level, I took science subjects that is mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Given the opportunity to attain academic studies, I want to be a veterinary scientist. I believe this scholarship will be a stepping stone for me to achieve my dream and bring honor to my family and community as well as transform their standard of living.
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss, Fergie.
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you Ms. Harrmehak.
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Fergie, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you.
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Well Fergie now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I think studying abroad will not offer me education and professional skills only, but life skills also. This will help me when it comes to social interactions with others social groups and it'll also be easier to access job opportunities .
07/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Okay, thank you Ms. Harmehak
08/12/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yes we can start.
08/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Very well,

And would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/12/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Okay Ms. Harmehak. I'm having connection problem this, I'm sorry .
09/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 261 0463: Good morning. Yes we can continue. Thank you
09/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I am currently communicating with Fergie or Mrs Kudzanai please?
09/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 261 0463: I am Mrs Kudzanai. Fergie is currently struggling with network connectivity. He is trying to get a better place to improve his connectivity
09/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I understand.

Have you been following the discussion so far?
09/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 261 0463: Yes I have been following
09/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, so far do you have any queries?
09/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 261 0463: No queries at all so far.
09/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

Mrs Kudzanai, were you able to discuss more regarding the finances from Fergie?

Since he happened to read the shared document at the earlier stages.
09/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 261 0463: Yes I did,  I was telling him that my prayer is he gets a bigger percentage of the scholarship. This will help ease the financial burden on me.
09/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I completely understand please,

Mrs Kudzanai, considering the finances involved, what is your take on the same?

If he is found eligible, are you willing to support him financially and mentally?
09/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 261 0463: I will try my best to offer financial assistance as well as supporting him mentally.
09/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are supportive, Mrs Kudzanai!

Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, may I know more about Fergie's siblings?
09/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 261 0463: Fergie is the first son in a family of 6 children. The second child is girl aged 18,  she will be doing her Advanced level studies next year. The next one is a girl aged 14 who is doing Form 3. There is a boy aged 10 who is in grade 5. There is a set of twin boys aged 8. They are in grade 3
09/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

It's a pleasure to know more about them, Mrs Kudzanai,

So who supports them all for the education financially please?
09/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am a primary school teacher, I don't earn much. The kids in primary school do not pay fees as they learn at the school I teach. The arrangement there is that our children as teachers do not pay fees. Secondary children I am paying for one child. The girl doing advanced level is having her fees paid for by a well wisher from our community.
09/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Fergie like he mentioned earlier had his fees paid for by an organization called Mashambanzou Care Trust
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I do understand.

However I would like to add and appreciate your efforts to support your children.
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Thank you
09/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you understand the following too?
09/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
09/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I do understand this very well. Like I alluded to earlier, I will try my best to assist him financially. Knowing him as I do, the Earn while you learn program will not pause any challenges to him. He is able to multi task and make sure he completes everything and that too in time. Growing up with a lot of responsibilities made him a hard worker
09/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Mrs Kudzanai.

However would you agree that he would require financial support from you as well?
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I do understand that
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: So are you willing to support him roughly $1000 a year?
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Yes, I will do
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am very confident that he will get the grades. Even the pre covid requirements, he will get them
09/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: It's great to know the same.

May I please have his O level results?
09/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am not at home presently. If you can allow me to send you the results by end of day today when I will be home
09/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: That's surely alright please.

You can type them if you recall.
09/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 261 0463: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please,

Can you please share his current subject combination along with what exactly he would like to study?
09/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 261 0463: He was doing
Mathematics
Chemistry
Biology
09/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: He appeared his A level exams this year please? <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Pharmacy or Veterinary Science are his passion
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Yes
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: And results will be out next year February
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Or late January
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

So since he wishes to study Pharmacy or Veterinary Sciences,

May I know why he didn't he pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it's a crucial science subject, isn't it?
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 261 0463: It  could be a result of poor career guidance, our research had shown that chemistry and biology are the key subjects.  Also since he had a grade C in Physics he could not pursue it at A level due to school policy that does not allow a learner to pursue a subject with a C
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
09/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 261 0463: From the above courses, we sat down and agreed that it would be best if he studies physiotherapy
09/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Sorry for getting back to you late. I was waiting to reach home and discuss the issue with Fergie
