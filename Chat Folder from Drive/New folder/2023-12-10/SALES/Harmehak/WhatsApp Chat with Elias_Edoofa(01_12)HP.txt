02/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Cathrine, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Patson better as parents.

02/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 390 6328: Iam the mother  of Delight and Patson is my husband 
Currently  I worked under ministry of health and child care iam a nurse my husband  is a Prisoner officer we are very happy as parents for our child to go further with education especially  at your University  in your country  it's our pleasure  thank you very much  we are wait to hearing from you
02/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Cathrine, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
02/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 390 6328: You are welcome
02/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Now, I would like to know Elias better as a student,

How he is at school, his interest and hobbies along with anything that you would like to share about him?
02/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 390 6328: Sorry  for delay  Anyway  My son is better  at school naturally  he is intelligence  
He is interested in sports especially  football  and watching  movies (Indians)
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know more about him, Mrs Cathrine.
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
