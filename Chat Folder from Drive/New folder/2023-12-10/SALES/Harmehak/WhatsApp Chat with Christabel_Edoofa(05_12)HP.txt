08/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: That's great.
08/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 604 3267: I am confident she will do better if not best
08/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Nhau.
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Mr Nhau, what exactly would Christabel like to study further please?
08/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 604 3267: In this case I am the provider and she there to choose whatever she like to study further.
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please, would she be able to share the same?
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Have just advised her to supply the required information
08/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
08/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

09/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 369 4506: yaah we can
09/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Alright and what motivates you to study Medicine, Christabel?
09/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 369 4506: it my passion.My former principal who is my role model motivates me
09/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Well that's great,

However what intrigued you towards pursuing a career in Medical sciences?

What all did you research regarding your desired field?
09/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 369 4506: it has high chances of getting jobs here in Zimbabwe since there are few doctors. Although it took so many has l find that l will make so much money after seven years of struggling.
09/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I do understand Christabel.

Did you ever happen to research regarding the requirements for Medicine, Christabel?
09/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 369 4506: Yaah someone who has passed biology and Mathematics and any other sciences subject . l should come out with 14-15 points on my A' level
09/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

And what is your take on the requirements of Physics as well to pursue Medicine?

Do you believe physics is a crucial science/medical subject?
09/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 369 4506: I do not they mainly need biology
09/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 369 4506: but would like to be a doctor is the any need of physics
09/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Yes please, it's a crucial science subject.

Since Medicine is all about human body and living beings, each one of Physics, Chemistry and Biology are a mandatory requirement.
09/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 369 4506: okay but now lm only doing Biology,Chemestry and Pure Maths
09/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
09/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 369 4506: oky l understand
09/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me Christabel?

09/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Unfortunately you cannot pursue medicine with your combination.

Physics is a mandatory requirement.
09/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 369 4506: oky
09/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: While I understand the same Christabel,

I would like to understand from you that what exactly in studies of medicine are you really looking forward to learning?

I believe you would agree that Medical sciences in itself is a vast field.
