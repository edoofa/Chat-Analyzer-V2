*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Hello sir 
It is the right the right person indeed
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Lydia,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 669 7287: It is a pleasure meeting you as well Mr Singh
23/11/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 630 8547
23/11/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Lydia, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kudzaishe, is that correct?
23/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kudzaishe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kudzaishe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Okay

From what l learnt Edoofa program is a program meant to assist students across the globe in pursuing their education in lndia .lt was founded by Anhaid Edutrain .lt offers 50 to 100% scholarships on tuiton .Inorder to cater for the other percentage of the tuiton and other expenses it has the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN programme where the student gets online projects to complete and receives money while studying.
23/11/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer Lydia, I see you are well informed.
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: But let me also brief you about the program.
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes Mr Singh that is exactly what l am looking for
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Lydia, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 669 7287: I believe l cam meet the metrics Mr Singh
23/11/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Lydia, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

23/11/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Mrs.Gondo, That is correct.
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: So Lydia, will you be able to meet the criteria?
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 669 7287: I believe l can be eligible for the scholarship sir
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Noted Lydia, now tell me did you understand the course?
23/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes sir l understood it very well
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 669 7287: If l were to be provided with the opportunity to pursue his career option and complete the course l envision myself five years down the road as a successful professional business woman who has made significant contributions to the business field .With a strong understanding of the business world ,l would have aacquired the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in my chosen buusiness career path.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 669 7287: As someone who has dreamt of  being in the business world since forever l am more than willing to give a thousand percent of my hardwork
23/11/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 669 7287: I want to be exposed to a new environment and get out of my comfort zone and be independent throughout the process of living  and studying in a foreign country.

India has a reputation in its quality education hence l want to pursue that and secure a career for myself .

I' m also interested in immersing a new culture, learning new languages and gaining a global perspective which can enhance my growth
23/11/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 669 7287: If given the opportunity to pursue my higher education through this scholarship and study abroad, I see myself gaining valuable knowledge, skills, and experiences that I can bring back to my home country and contribute towards the development of the education system.



 Studying abroad will also provide me with the opportunity to network and connect with experts, educators, and researchers in my field of study. I can collaborate with them to develop research projects, publications, and educational resources that can address the specific needs and challenges of my country's education system. By sharing these resources and knowledge, I can contribute towards improving the quality of education and fostering academic excellence in my country.

My experience studying abroad will also enable me to foster a global perspective and cross-cultural understanding, which I believe is crucial in today's interconnected world. I can promote cultural exchange programs, international collaborations, and intercultural awareness initiatives within the education system to broaden the horizons and perspectives of students in my country.
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 669 7287: I have already answered this sir but l shall repeat 

If given the opportunity to pursue my higher education through this scholarship and study abroad, I see myself gaining valuable knowledge, skills, and experiences that I can bring back to my home country and contribute towards the development of the education system.



 Studying abroad will also provide me with the opportunity to network and connect with experts, educators, and researchers in my field of study. I can collaborate with them to develop research projects, publications, and educational resources that can address the specific needs and challenges of my country's education system.

My experience studying abroad will also enable me to foster a global perspective and cross-cultural understanding, which I believe is crucial in today's interconnected world. I can promote cultural exchange programs, international collaborations, and intercultural awareness initiatives within the education system to broaden the horizons and perspectives of students in my country.
23/11/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, the message was meant for some other student.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lydia, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes sir l agree with you on that
I shall work with utmost dedication and l believe Edoofa would provide a conducive environment for me
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 630 8547: I was also wondering rhe same Mr Singh
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

23/11/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now Lydia, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Well understood Mr Singh
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 669 7287: No sir l have not researched about it yet
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Wow Edoofa plays such a vital role in reducing tuiton 
This is so amazing
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly, In simple words Lydia what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes sir l would love that
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 669 7287: This is so exceptionally amazing
The Edoofa programme enables students to pursue their careers ,study abroad and chase their dreams in an affordable way.lt is such a wonder.l really would be grateful to be part of such an amazing programme
23/11/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Lydia, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 669 7287: The EWYL is such a great programme
Especially for a student such as me be who is willing to indulge in a business world
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

23/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Wow amazing indeed
I see that the Earn while you learn programme is of immense help in enhancing your employability skills and it helps you in creating connections with a lot of people
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 669 7287: I believe this will be of great benefit to me.
This programme is the backborne of a successful future for those who get a chance to be Edoofians
23/11/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lydia, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
23/11/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 669 7287: This is so fascinating 
The EWYL makes education affordable for all
23/11/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Well Lydia, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You! <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Thank you Mr Singh for the lovely conversation 
Have a good day as well
23/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 630 8547: Wow the Edoofa programme is such a great programme .lt is quite an inspiration for students to study abroad and chase their dreams
24/11/23, 8:31 am - Gurvinder: Greetings Everyone,

*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
25/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 669 7287: Good morning sir 
Sorry l was unavailable yesterday but we can continue today
25/11/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Lydia,
I hope you are doing well.
25/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 669 7287: I am well sir thank you
25/11/23, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

25/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 630 8547: The Webinars help the student understand how they can improve their skills inorder to excel in any field.Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates or students from different universities due to the unique opportunities and knowledge they gain through such webinars. Talk about the practical skills and strategies they learn, which give them a competitive edge in the job market.


 Rhis is quite beneficial for any student who wishes to be an Edoofian
25/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 630 8547: Mr Singh its Lydia im using my mother's number im having challenges with my own
25/11/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
25/11/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lydia, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year.

25/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 630 8547: This is so fascinating 
The EWYL makes education affordable for all.
25/11/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/11/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 630 8547: Woow earning 3000 a year is more like earning the whole cost of education.This is brilliant .l believe the Edoofa programme is what l have been looking for
25/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Alright Lydia, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
25/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 630 8547: Yes Mr Singh
25/11/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
25/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 630 8547: We talked about it a little
25/11/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
25/11/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
25/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 630 8547: Im ready
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Lydia as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 630 8547: That will be around $1500-$2250
25/11/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Lydia, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/11/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 630 8547: Yes most parents cannot afford it 

$750 is reasonable
25/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 630 8547: Wow Edoofa is the way to go!
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 630 8547: It really is
25/11/23, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 630 8547: Okay sir
25/11/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Lydia basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
25/11/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: However Lydia, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 630 8547: Okay noted sir
25/11/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
25/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 630 8547: No sir haven' t heard of it
25/11/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
25/11/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright Lydia, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
25/11/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
25/11/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
25/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 630 8547: Well understood sir
25/11/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
25/11/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
25/11/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
25/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 630 8547: Okay 
So pertaining the VISA issue do l apply for my own VISA or does Edoofa help me in applying
25/11/23, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: Lydia, Edoofa will provide assistance in your VISA application.
25/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 630 8547: Okay l understand
25/11/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
25/11/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
25/11/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

25/11/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 630 8547: Greetings Mr Shubam 

As Me Singh said 
I am to  countinue my counselling session with you .
27/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Afternoon Everyone. 
 
*I am Mr. Shubham, The Senior Academician at Edoofa.* 

I have been evaluating your responses in the counseling session with your counselor.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counseling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
27/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Excuse me for my delayed response I wasn't able to get back to you at our scheduled time because of a family emergency.
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 630 8547: We did go through the counselling session as a family
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 630 8547: It is okay sir we can proceed
27/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: How was your discussion with Mr Gurvinder?
27/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 630 8547: It was awesome !He made me understand the whole Edoofa programme in depth
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright Mrs Gondo, so as of now would you like to ask anything please?
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Hello sir
We good to proceed
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 630 8547: I wanted to ask om the issue of payment of tuiton 
In the case that she gets the chance to be an Edoofian is it mandatory that the tuiton be paid in cash
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263776308547 the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
28/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Greetings Mr Shubam
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 630 8547: Okay sir well understood

29/11/23, 11:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
29/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 669 7287: Yes

And the enrollment fee its $350 which can be paid $200 within 7 days and the remaining $150 in a period of one month
29/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263773860955 @263776308547*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that *Lydia* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 630 8547: 1.Bachelor of commerce 

2.lndia

3.$6000 -$8000

4.$2000-$3000

5.$350 which is to be paid in 7 days 

6.The earn while you learn programme is a programme that helps students to pay their tuiton,food and accomodation through earning while you learn by getting online projects which help them earn scholarship credits which can be paid to them in form kf cash.The EWYL helps students enhance their working skills thus overally enhancing a student's employability.The earn while you learn programme differentiates Edoofa from other scholarships in the sense that a student will be able to lift the financial burden of the parent's shoulders as they will cover a part or all of the remining tuiton as well as food and accomodation.

8. Okay sir.So the fee will deduct part if the annual tuiton ?
29/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263776308547*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
29/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263776308547* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Lydia* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Lydia’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
29/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *06th or 07th of December 2023* for $200 and the *05 th or 06th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *06th or 07th of December 2023*
