24/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok thank you
25/11/23, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mutsawashe,
I hope you are doing well.
25/11/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: I see you are well informed,
but let me also brief you about the program.
25/11/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25/11/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
25/11/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25/11/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes thank you I need it
25/11/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

26/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 78 721 3425: Ok thank you
27/11/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Please be patient, all concerns related to this will be addressed ahead.
27/11/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir
27/11/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 721 3425: I need the scholarship seriously sir
27/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Yes I understand that Mutsawashe.
27/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mutsawashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I will get it
27/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 721 3425: We can continue
27/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 721 3425: So I must complete it today
27/11/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is preferable for you to get a higher quantum of scholarship.
27/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 721 3425: There is poor network here 😌
27/11/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your problem but can you still try to continue with the counselling session?
27/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Mutsawashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes yes
28/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I obtained eleven points ...will I get the scholarship or my results are not good

29/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir my battery was low we continue now
29/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 721 3425: I agree with you sir
29/11/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 721 3425: That's true sir that's why I choose Edoofa
29/11/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

29/11/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mutsawashe, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir let me ask
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: yes, do share your concern.
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Is there any amount that I must pay if I get the scholarship
29/11/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Let us be patient and continue with the counselling session, all your concerns related to this topic will be addressed ahead.
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 721 3425: No
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 721 3425: But what I know is that it is expensive
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mutsawashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir I understand
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I want to know about it
29/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir
29/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Can we go further
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I will benefit lot of things
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mutsawashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir so the remaining fee is paid at the same time or
29/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Hello sir
29/11/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Let us continue the session, everything will be cleared.
29/11/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/11/23, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Mutsawashe, let us finish the counselling session today itself to increase your chances.
29/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Wow wow that's really amaizing
29/11/23, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
29/11/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
29/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I was watching the video that you send
29/11/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/11/23, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Please address.
29/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 721 3425: We can continue
29/11/23, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mutsawashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir
29/11/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I told my mom about it and she said it is good
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir
29/11/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected.
29/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe, my working hours are over, but for you I am extending this session.
29/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I was reading we are together
29/11/23, 4:44 pm - Gurvinder: Please address.
29/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok do you are trying to say I have to pay $300-$450
29/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Application fee
29/11/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: I am asking you that if you have to pay $300-$450 for one application, how much you will pay for 5 applications?
29/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 721 3425: $1500-$2250
29/11/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mutsawashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/11/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok ok
30/11/23, 8:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Food and accommodation
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe, food and accommodation are available inside the University campus at an affordable price.
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: And the cost of travelling to India is one time cost, that has to be paid by you.
30/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok
30/11/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
30/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 721 3425: No sir go further
30/11/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 721 3425: $350 is paid every year
30/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mutsawashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir
30/11/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/11/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
30/11/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/11/23, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
30/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 721 3425: Let me read sir

01/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 721 3425: Yes
01/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
01/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir if I pay $350 ,how much is the cost of of food and accommodation
01/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe, the University provides food and accomodation at an affordable price, and remember the students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

01/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 721 3425: Yes sir I cannot afford the costs
01/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Mutsawashe,  I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Don't you think that through Earn While You Learn program, you can ease the the financial burden more.
01/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 721 3425: Ok sir
01/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 721 3425: Yes I can sir
01/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
01/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
