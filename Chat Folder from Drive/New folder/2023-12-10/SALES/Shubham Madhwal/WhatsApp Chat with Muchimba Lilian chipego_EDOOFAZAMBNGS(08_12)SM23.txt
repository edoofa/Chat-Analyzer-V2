Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
08/12/23, 12:17 pm - +260 770182875: My understanding about Edoofa scholarships is that they are schoolarships and gives opportunities to performing students not only in Zambia but also other countries too

08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
08/12/23, 12:29 pm - +260 770182875: Okay understood

08/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.

With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others.

I just completed my grade twelve at Njase girls secondary school in choma .I have an aspiration for   be a  for business  administrator  and  I enjoy engineering basically mechanical  engineering so if given a chance to study any of the two course I would be humbled and thankful. My mother passed when I was in my fourth grade and my father is a police officer in Mongu in the western part of Zambia.   My father's highest level of education was grade twelve after that he went for training to be a police officer  . In my secondary school journey my aunty and my uncle have been of been sponsoring my education needs not until I completed my grade twelve in the year twenty- twenty  three which is rather this year.on the part for who is supporting me with my financial needs abroad I am not very sure if my aunty and my uncle will be able to continue giving me support until that that far or maybe another relative of mine will offer me support when I am there.I have one sibling who is my young brother and he will be going in his Ninth grade next year . I was learning at Njase girls secondary school from the year twenty-twenty nineteen to the year twenty-twenty  three  and it is located in choma which is in the southern part of Zambia.The school fees was two thousand two hundred and fifty five for the first two years I was there and it was later reduced to one thousand  five  hundred and fifty five  in the last three years I was there this was because a free education policy was introduced in when the government was changed  . In the year twenty -twenty one  I was given a sponsorship for school fees only as it became a bit difficult for my aunty and my uncle to support me with both my school fees and my trunk food at the same time as they had children and other dependents too.My sponsor was a former Njase girl too.I just hope I qualify to be at your school with my results .

09/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 770182875: While at Njase which is currently my previous school I learned how to live my life  without parental guidance and actually drive my self to make decisions that are to my benefits and also to uphold  my parents reputation.By  it's nature Njase is a mission school and so every    pupil is to know how important God is in their life  and while there I learned to fear God as the moto of the school states that the fare of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom .the school offers help to pupils  in  all possible angle  therefore teaching us the pupils how to love and share the little we have .The teachers or rather the school administration was not my only source of wisdom but my friends were also a part of building me to what I am today.while at Njase I participated not only in academic activities like literature quiz under LATAS competitions but I also did sports like handball and volleyball just to keep my self fit physically and mentally .Not only did I participate in this but I was also an active member of a club called Let Girls Learn  club which was a club that was focusing on educating girls.The club also taught me a lot as I am a girl too.

09/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 770182875: I have a role model who inspires me .The president of Zambia his exallency Mr Hakainde Hichilema is my inspiration as he also did a business course.Though he was a simple villager he was determined to be  big in the world of business administrator 
 and so his determination also drives   me to the the passion for business  and the fact that I was very good at calculation while at school also motivate me to pursue this course
