So shall we continue with your process?

No problem, we may proceed
08/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
08/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Studying abroad gives me an opportunity to acquire more not only about the program I have selected to do but it allows me to learn more about other cultures around the world, just being exposed to a different environment promotes understanding other cultures, which is quite intriguing for me, it also boosts career prospects.

Studying abroad also gives me the chance to create a global network by giving me a chance to make new friends around the world.
08/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
08/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I am aware that Edoofa can assist in covering between 50% to 80% of the costs which then leads to the costs being cut down to somewhere between $2000 - $3000 which will also be be partly tackled by the earn while you learn program hence it is very cost friendly
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

09/12/23, 10:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Jainos, Mr and Mrs Mugova @263786152641 @263772923584 @263772315491, How are you?

09/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 292 3584: Yaaa we are all well
09/12/23, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please

09/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed we are sir, full time.
09/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
09/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I think I now fully understand this
09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 615 2641: It is quite a great opportunity for students
09/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn program?
09/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Ofcourse, no problem sir
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

09/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed it is sir, it is quite a unique trait that is not offered by any other University. A chance to sponsor your own higher education is just amazing, Ive never seen anything quite like it
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
09/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 615 2641: This is the Edoofa cycle its basically the set of steps or stages that I will get through when getting my Application processed

In the first step, I have to receive proper information about the Edoofa program so that I understand the unique benefits and the value that Edoofa is doing for me

The second step is The Edoofa scholarship eligibility 
check is done and interview is taken by the Edoofa Board.
Once the I am found eligible by presenting their grades and performance in the interview, they are offered the chance of enrollment in the Edoofa program.

Then the third step is the Acceptance Letter from Edoofa, here if I manage to clear the Interview Process, I will then get accepted into our Program and get a scholarship Acceptance Letter from Edoofa.

The fourth Step involves finalizing my enrollment into the Edoofa Program by completing the Edoofa Enrollment fees of $200-$350. 
Once the I pay the enrollment fee, Edoofa helps in generating the 
 Admission Acceptance Letter(AAL) from the University/college as well as the *Visa letter* which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa processing. 

The Fifth Stege, once the enrollment is completed, I will rely on the full-fledged 
support provided by our Admission Officers. 
 
At this stage,  I will start to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program and start earning at an early stage.

Once the university sessions are over, I will then secure the Admission offer letter  from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation and then i will confirm my admission within a stipulated time frame.

In the Sixth Stege Edoofa helps in generating the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL)from the University as well as the *Visa application letter.* 
Edoofa also guides in the mailing process to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa processing. 
All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at this stage.

Then last but not least is stage 7.By this time when the I complete the Admission formalities and Visa Processes, it is time for the transition journey from my home country(Zimbabwe) to India.
 Upon arrival at the Airport, The Edoofa team will be there to take me to my respective Top Ranking Universities of India.
This is my basic understanding of the image
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
