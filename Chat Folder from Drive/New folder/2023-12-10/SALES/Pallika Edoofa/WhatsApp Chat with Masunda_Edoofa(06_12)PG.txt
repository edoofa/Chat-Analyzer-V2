09/12/23, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: As I have already shared the information, so, Ms. Magwaza, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 576 7579: yeah i know,im not sure yet about the plans and preparations im ready to sacrifice so that my child get access to the opportunities
09/12/23, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Magwaza, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 576 7579: yeah i will manage
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Magwazwa, Considering your financial conditions and being a single mother, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
09/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 576 7579: I will try my best
09/12/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Magwaza
