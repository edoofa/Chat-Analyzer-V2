331 - 13 Dec 2023 04:26PM - +91 70272 82665: In today's wisdom I've learnt that as a student honesty and hard work work hand in hand in moulding one's life and reputation.Honesty in my opinion is being true to oneself and being open to oneself about strengths and weaknesses.I believe that if one works hard and is true to themselves then non can stand against them as the hardwork is the drive behind one's success.
332 - 15 Dec 2023 02:39PM - +91 70272 82665: The Plan *Since I already have 3 different groups where I carry out the Edoofa counselling I tell the candidates I have assessed to be eligible to spread my link via WhatsApp. *Once they share it and the candidates join the group .I explain to them about Edoofa and then ask them some questions regarding their long term and short term dreams and aspirations and how far they would go to achieve them.Those that I find more capable and serious I then share the offline form of Edoofa with them. *As for my Facebook page I post a story about Edoofa and those students who are interested come to my inbox and I add them to the group which I carry out sessions about Edoofa *This applies also to Instagram
333 - 15 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: Tomorrow's call_*  I hope you are having a lovely winter morning. Just a quick reminder about our call tomorrow. Super excited to catch up and chat about the awesome industrial visit we've got in the pipeline.  *Time: 7:00 PM*🕕  If there's anything specific you want to cover, bring it along.

As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:  ⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?  *Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Take your time, as we are going to discuss this tomorrow!

As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:  ⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?  *Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Take your time, as we are going to discuss this tomorrow!

In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐

Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 1:30 p.m.

Seize it with optimism and determination, for even the smallest steps lead to great journeys.'_🌸
209 - 13 Dec 2023 04:28PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that a network problem could be a major issue. However, if you think we can connect through another means, please let me know. It's the second day that you haven't attended your EWYL sessions with me, and I'm concerned that we might be off to a challenging start. I believe staying on track is crucial, so I'd appreciate any updates.
210 - 14 Dec 2023 01:35PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanyaradzwa!  Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
211 - 14 Dec 2023 03:13PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, may I know if you are facing any challenges?

213 - 15 Dec 2023 01:33PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanyaradzwa!  I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact! Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐

I learnt that honesty is the cornerstone of integrity. It helps a person academically. The reward of maintaining honesty extend beyond avoiding penalties. The other thing I learnt is that working hard and being industrious implies that you are doing things that take courage and boldness. The key aspect of hard work is the commitment to continuous learning.

435 - 15 Dec 2023 08:32AM - +91 75081 21739: This week I have learnt that in this challenging world students often find themselves navigating a maze of responsibilities, expectations and deadlines.  First I learned about honesty which plays a vital role in our life's as college students. In the academic realm honesty manifest through commitment to academic integrity. This includes plagarism, citing resources accurately and submitting one's work rather than succumbing to the temptation of Academic dishonesty. Communication is equally vital. Honesty also fosters an environment of open communication. Secondly we also learnt about hard work. It involves setting goals, managing time efficiently and consistently putting in the effort required to succeed. One of the key aspects of hard work is commitment to continuous learning  In conclusion, college students must recognizer and embrace the virtues of honesty and hard work. These principles shape character laying the groundwork for fulfilling and impactful life.
436 - 15 Dec 2023 08:36AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Charmaine I appreciate your thoughtful reflections on the challenges that students face in navigating the complexities of responsibilities, expectations, and deadlines in today's world.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.  Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟  I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.  Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold  Best regards, Ms. Jasmine

287 - 15 Dec 2023 06:54PM - Ashi Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Galgotias University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them.  As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
288 - 15 Dec 2023 06:56PM - +263 78 036 3800: Okay noted thanks ms Ashi
289 - 15 Dec 2023 07:07PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well -  Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000 .  If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN University , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.  I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
290 - 15 Dec 2023 07:34PM - +263 78 036 3800: Yes it's clear
291 - 15 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that @263780363800 . Let's continue with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:  1. Tuition Fee: $0 2. Accommodation Fee: $0 3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575 4. International Student Development Fund: $300 5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125 6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
292 - 15 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.  At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.  It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
293 - 15 Dec 2023 09:00PM - +263 78 036 3800: Yes it's all clear
294 - 15 Dec 2023 09:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:  1. Tuition Fee 2. Living Cost 3. Library Fee 4. Examination Fee 5. EDB and Book Bank 6. International Student Development Fund 7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost 8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
295 - 15 Dec 2023 09:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the ""Earn While You Learn"" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.",No,No

Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
102 - 14 Dec 2023 04:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263716946404 Are we still connected?

108 - 15 Dec 2023 03:06PM - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am

110 - 15 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are available for the session?
119 - 15 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
120 - 15 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
121 - 15 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
122 - 15 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
123 - 15 Dec 2023 07:32PM - +263 71 694 6404: Yes ma'am
124 - 15 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
125 - 15 Dec 2023 10:55PM - Ashi Edoofa: As it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.

344 - 15 Dec 2023 08:33PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.  At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.  It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion.  We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete MVN university admission formalities.

333 - 15 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Makaita,  In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.  Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
353 - 15 Dec 2023 06:34PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.  The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
354 - 15 Dec 2023 06:36PM - +263 78 871 0042: Yes ma'am
355 - 15 Dec 2023 06:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.  With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.  This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
356 - 15 Dec 2023 07:24PM - +263 78 871 0042: The network is awful sorry ma'am
357 - 15 Dec 2023 07:25PM - +263 78 871 0042: Yes it does
358 - 15 Dec 2023 07:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, that you are having network challenges. However, It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
359 - 15 Dec 2023 07:49PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.  The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.  Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1250 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of 250 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
360 - 15 Dec 2023 07:52PM - +263 78 871 0042: Yes we are
361 - 15 Dec 2023 08:02PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.  I hope you are clear about this as well?
362 - 15 Dec 2023 08:06PM - +263 78 871 0042: Yes we are j
364 - 15 Dec 2023 08:17PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
365 - 15 Dec 2023 08:27PM - +263 78 871 0042: Yes please
366 - 15 Dec 2023 08:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
367 - 15 Dec 2023 08:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

I can understand your thoughts and appreciate your willingness to support your child with the best education. As you have shared that you have a pending enrollment fess, I had a conversation with your career counselor and I would love to offer you a solution. However,  Before we proceed, with that I would like us to have a discussion about the offer letter in order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the offer letter and the university.  Once we have completed this discussion about the offer letter, We will redirect our conversation to your concern. I hope this sounds good for you ?

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.  I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
298 - 15 Dec 2023 08:06PM - +263 77 739 8790: Yes it does thank you
299 - 15 Dec 2023 08:17PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263777398790, Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

Could you please confirm your availability to connect with us today for our discussion?
130 - 15 Dec 2023 01:19PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I'm now available

133 - 15 Dec 2023 01:37PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
148 - 15 Dec 2023 04:11PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?

150 - 15 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 71 870 6208: So am i going to pay another registration fee despite the one i already payed 200
151 - 15 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 71 870 6208: Because was told it was for  me to reserve my seat am now lest wih 150$
152 - 15 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 71 870 6208: Aint clear on dat one
153 - 15 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to clear your doubts here. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $500- $1000 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter.  I hope you are clear now?
154 - 15 Dec 2023 04:38PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK understood now

42 - 15 Dec 2023 02:48PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
48 - 15 Dec 2023 06:46PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tafadzwa EWYL23E0987)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.  This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.",No,Yes

51 - 15 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I believe Ms. Vilsha must have asked you to share your academic documents with us.  Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
52 - 15 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
53 - 15 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
54 - 15 Dec 2023 02:59PM - +263 78 126 2807: I can share the recommendation letter when we open schools in January
55 - 15 Dec 2023 07:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that can be waited.

269 - 15 Dec 2023 08:46PM - +263 71 246 3034: Well Sir the issue is that I really wanted to do radiology off which The Edoofian program does not offer it to students doing Math, Biology and Chemistry plus I also researched about the other degree option that I was optioned with and I would not have been happy with then if I had done  the because I am really dedicated to Radiology . Besides that your Program is very wonderful Sir I thank you for your time and everything Most Thanks to Mr Kunal
270 - 15 Dec 2023 08:52PM - Austin: That is a genuine concern Nigel, while I was going through your profile I found your strong inclination to health sector, saving lives and using Radiology to improve Medical facilities
271 - 15 Dec 2023 08:53PM - Austin: Now, this is something that caught me and I was also interested in understanding how exactly do you intend to use your learnings in Radiology to apply on Medical field and what are your inspirations?
272 - 15 Dec 2023 09:09PM - +263 71 246 3034: Well sir  radiology one of the least acknowledged profession in the medical sector were by people take it for granted and mostly student run towards the the Medical degree where by the want to become specialised doctors for example cardiologist.but  they forget that everyday accidents happen and people need Scans to show the  fractured bones even parts of the brain that may be damaged Well I was inspired to do Radiology 3years ago ,it was not actually an inspiration but a regret because  I made a friend who had broke his arm and the nearest hospital did not have a permanent Radiologist so we were supposed to wait till the one Radiologist who visited  the hospital came
273 - 15 Dec 2023 09:42PM - Austin: You are quite a visionary Nigel and it is good to see that you have explored this field of Medical science that is less emphasized but is of immense importance
274 - 15 Dec 2023 09:42PM - Austin: What if I say, there is a course that allignes with your aspirations that was offered to you which includes Radiology, scanning , diagnosing etc?
275 - 15 Dec 2023 09:45PM - Austin: A Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) typically focuses on laboratory testing and analysis of various biological specimens to aid in the diagnosis, treatment of diseases and while the primary emphasis is on laboratory work, there are career opportunities and connections to radiology and imaging-related aspects that individuals with an MLT background might explore. Here are some potential career paths and connections:  Radiology Technologist/Technician:  Individuals with a background in MLT may pursue additional training to become radiology technologists. Radiology technologists operate imaging equipment, such as X-ray machines and CT scanners, to create images of the internal structures of the body. MRI Technologist:  With additional training, MLT graduates can become MRI technologists. MRI technologists specialize in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines to produce detailed images of the body's internal organs and tissues. CT Technologist:  Similar to MRI technologists, CT technologists operate computed tomography (CT) scanners to create cross-sectional images of the body. Additional training in CT technology may be required. Nuclear Medicine Technologist:  MLT graduates interested in nuclear medicine can pursue a career as nuclear medicine technologists. These professionals use radioactive materials to diagnose and treat diseases. Radiation Therapist:  Radiation therapists administer radiation treatments to patients as part of cancer treatment plans. While this role involves therapeutic rather than diagnostic procedures, individuals with a strong background in healthcare may find this field appealing. Laboratory Management and Quality Assurance:  MLT graduates may take on roles in laboratory management and quality assurance within medical imaging departments. This involves ensuring the accuracy, efficiency, and regulatory compliance of laboratory and imaging operations. Clinical Research:  MLT professionals with an interest in research may find opportunities in clinical research related to diagnostic imaging. This could involve contributing to the development and improvement of imaging technologies. Healthcare Administration:  Individuals with an MLT background may transition into roles in healthcare administration, overseeing departments that include both medical laboratories and diagnostic imaging services. It's important to note that pursuing additional certifications or specialized training may be necessary to transition into certain imaging-related roles
276 - 15 Dec 2023 09:58PM - +263 71 246 3034: I didn't know that MLT had so much in common with radiology Sir am really surprised

247 - 15 Dec 2023 03:42PM - Gurvinder: @260971873656 I hope you are aware of the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
248 - 15 Dec 2023 03:46PM - +260 97 1873656: I think I came across one of your writeups.....sure
249 - 15 Dec 2023 03:46PM - Gurvinder: Yes, the Enrollment fee is 350USD and its is to be paid in 7 days, However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
250 - 15 Dec 2023 03:47PM - +260 97 1873656: Noted
251 - 15 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Gurvinder: *@260971873656*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
252 - 15 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Beauty* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
253 - 15 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Beauty’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
254 - 15 Dec 2023 04:37PM - +260 97 1873656: Noted and thank you very much <This message was edited>
255 - 16 Dec 2023 08:57AM - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *23rd or 24th of December 2023* for $200 and the  *23rd or 24th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.  2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *23rd or 24th of December 2023*",No,Yes

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

36 - 15 Dec 2023 10:19AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
37 - 15 Dec 2023 10:19AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

40 - 15 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Birthwell, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
41 - 15 Dec 2023 03:53PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes l think so

23 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
24 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

28 - 15 Dec 2023 01:36PM - +263 71 394 3484: Yeah true ...so what's the ways forward
29 - 15 Dec 2023 02:21PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Bright, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30 - 15 Dec 2023 02:32PM - +263 71 394 3484: Yes of course and as you can see my mom is already participating that much and asking a lot kkkk
31 - 15 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Gurvinder: Yes, I appreciate her participation in the counselling session.
32 - 15 Dec 2023 03:09PM - Gurvinder: Now Bright, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
33 - 15 Dec 2023 03:11PM - +263 71 394 3484: My dad is usually busy during the day but he will surely participate

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?

86 - 15 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
87 - 15 Dec 2023 10:45AM - +263 71 415 8096: The main reason I want to study abroad is to experience overseas atmospheres and to acquire overseas skills which I might not be able to acquire in my country and India has been one of  my dream country
88 - 15 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
89 - 15 Dec 2023 11:02AM - +263 71 415 8096: I would share the skills I would have acquired to some of the education facilities in my country
90 - 15 Dec 2023 11:23AM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Thelma, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree?

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
93 - 15 Dec 2023 11:27AM - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir And about that India is a developing country right
94 - 15 Dec 2023 12:16PM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

119 - 15 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
120 - 15 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
121 - 15 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

127 - 15 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Gurvinder: Thelma, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

147 - 16 Dec 2023 10:19AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thelma, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_",No,Yes

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

44 - 16 Dec 2023 09:27AM - Gurvinder: Your involvement with the Leo Club and your studies in sociology have clearly shaped your passion for contributing to society. It's admirable how your experiences in donation drives, community interactions, and awareness campaigns have instilled in you a strong sense of responsibility towards social welfare. Pursuing social work seems like a natural progression, given your genuine desire to make a positive impact. Is there a specific area within social work that you feel particularly drawn to, such as community development, advocacy, or direct social services? Understanding this could help tailor your path within the field to align with your interests and strengths.
45 - 16 Dec 2023 09:39AM - +263 71 400 3063: Let’s say community development and social services. We used to do these awareness campaigns at school for example the gender based violence compaign. And this is key to what I really wanted- to actively participate and demolish these   So I’d go for direct social services",No,Yes

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 15 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

20 - 15 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

22 - 15 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23 - 15 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

28 - 15 Dec 2023 01:44PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nodumo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - +263 78 313 4116: I believe I have what it takes to meet with the two significant metrics and to also get a higher quantum of the scholarship

Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - +263 78 313 4116: I believe I have what it takes to meet with the two significant metrics and to also get a higher quantum of the scholarship
30 - 15 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: That is great.
31 - 15 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: Now Noduma, I would like to know you better as a student.

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

After studying law in India, if you want to practice in Zimbabwe or any other African country, It won't hamper your career as the Law degree in India is internationally recognised but it's best to understand their specific legal system and regulations before you start working.

126 - 15 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
127 - 15 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
128 - 15 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

129 - 15 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
130 - 15 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

132 - 15 Dec 2023 01:05PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Esther what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
133 - 15 Dec 2023 01:30PM - +263 77 989 5070: Ok Sir
134 - 15 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
135 - 15 Dec 2023 03:27PM - +263 77 989 5070: Yes Sir
136 - 15 Dec 2023 03:28PM - Gurvinder: Esther, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

137 - 15 Dec 2023 03:31PM - +263 77 989 5070: Understood Sir
138 - 15 Dec 2023 03:33PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

185 - 15 Dec 2023 04:49PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

49 - 15 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
50 - 15 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

74 - 15 Dec 2023 11:13AM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
75 - 15 Dec 2023 11:13AM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

80 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:  *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.  *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.  *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.  *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.  *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.  A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

19 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me also brief you about the program.
20 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21 - 15 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries.

26 - 15 Dec 2023 02:39PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Precious, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27 - 15 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 77 614 0897: I think I can meet the two significant metrices
28 - 15 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Gurvinder: That is great.

56 - 15 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Gurvinder: Also Mr Muleya, I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficult situation your family faced due to your mother's health challenges. It's indeed a trying time when health issues bring forth financial burdens.  It's heartening to know that despite the challenges, there were well-wishers who stepped in to support Lushomo's education, recognizing her exceptional academic performance. Their kindness and support made a significant difference in enabling her to continue her education in boarding school.  Given Lushomo's aspirations for higher education abroad, may the well-wishers who generously supported her schooling consider extending their support for her further studies? Their contribution could profoundly impact her academic journey and help fulfill her aspirations.
57 - 15 Dec 2023 01:57PM - +260 97 7482282: Sincerely speaking,the school accounts still indicates that the well wishers have not deposited any single fee for the girl . That means I will have to pay the balance in order to collect her results. You may verify that with her former school authorities

64 - 15 Dec 2023 11:37AM - +263 71 401 8032: Personally I am a person who enjoy saving lives .That's what makes me .  So in aerospace engineering, I like the fact that one will be dealing with space equipment including satellites. With those satellites one will be able to do investigations of a lot of things including criminal cases , weather forecast cases  , viral diseases cases etc .That way one can save a life by providing answers as soon as the investigations are over. That motivates me a lot.  In cardiothoreic surgery it's all about saving people's lives. According to my last check cases of those dieing due to heart problems are increasing at a faster rate .That break my heart so I decided I should be for those people. That drove me to pick the cardiothoreic surgery programme as my higher  education study .

31 - 15 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Gurvinder: That is great, let me also brief you about the program.
32 - 15 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
33 - 15 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
34 - 15 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
35 - 15 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
39 - 15 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
40 - 15 Dec 2023 05:59PM - +260 97 9151577: yes I am, I'm  looking for a chance to become independent and  to take  little responsibility of my education and my parents financial burned.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

48 - 16 Dec 2023 11:24AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Ntali, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?",No,Yes

Since am not really interested in getting a job, it will help me start some of my own software development companies that will be distributing softwares around the globe helping people with disabilities, making work more efficient and easier and educating people. My dream is to change and inspire lives, change the way that people do their things(making it easier), solve problems that stress people in their daily lives for example making a softwares that  allow deaf people to interact with their environment, a software that can reduce cases in GBV and lastly a software that can help reduce depression levels in human beings by allowing them to talk to each other and solve their problems. So in my point of view, given this opportunity, it will allow me to achieve my dreams. I believe that my education will provide me with skills and knowledge to succeed in this competitive industry and am also confident that I will be able to find a job that utilizes my skills and allow me to contribute to the development of this cutting-edge technology. So am excited to the opportunities that lie ahead  and am confident that I will be able to achieve my goals

124 - 15 Dec 2023 08:39AM - Gurvinder: Let us continue the session now.
125 - 15 Dec 2023 08:39AM - Gurvinder: In simple words Shalom what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
126 - 15 Dec 2023 08:41AM - +263 78 014 8716: What are the  *Earn while you learn programs*???
127 - 15 Dec 2023 09:54AM - Gurvinder: Shalom, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
128 - 15 Dec 2023 11:21AM - +263 78 014 8716: Okay am following
129 - 15 Dec 2023 11:22AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
130 - 15 Dec 2023 11:22AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
131 - 15 Dec 2023 11:22AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

141 - 15 Dec 2023 11:22AM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
142 - 15 Dec 2023 11:30AM - +263 78 014 8716: I think this program is a very good and beneficial program. Basically I could benefit from it
143 - 15 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Shalom, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
144 - 15 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 78 014 8716: Okay i understand now
145 - 15 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

173 - 15 Dec 2023 02:20PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
174 - 15 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Gurvinder: @263780148716 Are we still connected?

156 - 15 Dec 2023 02:21PM - +260 97 7825680: Alright sir
157 - 15 Dec 2023 02:27PM - +260 97 4435010: The reason I want to study out the country is I think you people have better teaching facilities which are improved than our country.And I can be offered a lot of job opportunities depending if only I choose a better course and have good results at the end of it all
158 - 15 Dec 2023 02:28PM - +260 97 4435010: And the other reason is that our country is a bit backwards in technologies
159 - 15 Dec 2023 03:06PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you two are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

160 - 15 Dec 2023 03:20PM - +260 97 4435010: Well I can help in the development of the the education system in our country by becoming a lecturer whose advocate is to introduce new learning skills or if the plan fails ...I can encourage people to work hard so that they apply for the sponsorship and use the technics in our country.... for a better tomorrow..... If I would get another opportunity I would like to organize people who are doing the same course as mine and act as the pressure group towards our country so that the learning skills can be changed by showing them what we archived using new learning skills....
161 - 15 Dec 2023 03:22PM - +260 97 7825680: What I would like to contribute in the education system of my country is the quality of education offered. I sadly noticed that a lot of pupils graduate from school without them acquiring any skills at all. What has caused this is lack of practical subjects in the curriculum. In Zambia it's mostly on theory and less of practical so I would rather change that first for the majority of graduates to acquire skills to enable them to survive
162 - 15 Dec 2023 03:25PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Simposo and Muchindu, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree?
163 - 15 Dec 2023 03:25PM - +260 97 4435010: Absolutely true

25 - 15 Dec 2023 12:08PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22 - 15 Dec 2023 12:08PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23 - 15 Dec 2023 12:08PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
155 - 15 Dec 2023 02:35PM - +263 78 928 2752: Yes I think it will be beneficial to me
156 - 15 Dec 2023 02:59PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thulisile, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
157 - 15 Dec 2023 03:00PM - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I understand
158 - 15 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I am able to study with minimum supervision due to my personal motivation and determination.I strongly aim to bring positive attitude and values to the people around me. I wrote 11 ,O level subjects and produced good results including mathematics,English and Science at Silveira high school in Masvingo then later on went to learn at Guinea Fowl high school for my A level where I was doing Arts subjects,thus  history , geography and literature in English.Guinea Fowl high school was charging Fees at $365 every term . I would love to study Tourism and Hotel management. My hobbies include travelling, music(listening,playing,singing)and also cooking and baking . My only weakness is feeling too low when I fail to achieve something mostly. My strengths include; Discipline being able to work consistently and complete tasks on time. Time management being able to plan and prioritize tasks effectively. Organization - being able to keep track of assignments. Collaboration - being able to work well with others on group projects. Communication -  I am able to express ideas clearly and effectively. Resourcefulness - I can be able to find and use resources effectively.  My Dad is a retired police officer since 2019 and now rearing chickens as a source of income and my mother is a housewife who bakes cakes also to help bring income at home .My Dad ended in form 2 and my mommy ended in form 4 . I have 3 siblings 2 brothers and a little sister who is going to grade 5 next year  I really hope you will help me pursue my studies with a 100% scholarship as my parents will struggle to get me into school but I talked to them and they are willing to pay for the accommodation and the food if you will consider me to be part of your education family.

205 - 15 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

It is not a secret that many people in  Africa struggle with poor diets, but the reasons behind this problem are often misunderstood. One major factor is the stagnation and inefficiency of the region's farming industry. Many farms are small and lack access to modern technology and equipment, leading to low productivity and poor nutrition. In this essay, we'll explore the ways in which Africa's farming industry is holding the region back, and how this contributes to poor diets.  Many farms in Africa still rely on traditional methods of farming, such as hand-tilling the soil and using simple tools like hoes and machetes. This is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that leads to low productivity and poor yields. In addition, farmers often lack access to modern equipment like tractors, irrigation systems, and crop-dusting planes, which could help them increase their productivity and improve their yields.  In many parts of Africa, farmers lack access to reliable sources of water for irrigation. This means that they are at the mercy of the weather, and a bad rainy season can mean a poor harvest. In addition, even when there is enough rain, it can be hard for farmers to get the water to their crops due to a lack of infrastructure like canals and pipes. This makes it difficult for farmers to grow the crops they need to feed their families and make a living.  One of the biggest challenges facing farmers in Africa is the lack of access to high-quality seeds and fertilizer. Many farmers are stuck using old, low-yielding varieties of crops that are not well adapted to the local environment. In addition, they often cannot afford the high cost of modern seeds and fertilizer, or they don't have access to the right information on how to use them properly. This makes it hard for farmers to improve their yields and ensure a reliable source of food for them.  Many farmers in Africa struggle to get the credit they need to invest in their farms and improve their yields. Banks often require collateral, which many farmers don't have, and interest rates can be prohibitively high. In addition, the informal credit system that many farmers rely on can be exploitative and unfair. As a result, farmers are often trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt, which prevents them from investing in their farms and breaking out of the poverty trap.  Many farmers in Africa lack secure land tenure, meaning they don't have clear legal rights to the land they farm. This makes it hard for them to invest in their farms, as they may not be sure they will be able to keep the land in the future. In addition, poor land tenure can lead to conflicts with neighbors, as well as vulnerability to exploitation by powerful landlords. This insecurity prevents many farmers from achieving a stable income and improving their standard of living.  In addition to the factors already mentioned, there are several other factors that contribute to the poor diets of many people in  Africa. These include inadequate infrastructure, lack of knowledge about nutrition, and cultural factors like traditional gender roles. For example, in some cultures, women are responsible for feeding the family, but they may not have the resources or knowledge to provide a healthy and balanced diet. This can have serious consequences for the health and well-being of the entire family.  In summary, the poor diets of many people in sub-Saharan Africa are caused by a variety of complex factors, including stagnant and inefficient farming practices, lack of access to credit and loans, poor land tenure, inadequate infrastructure, lack of knowledge about nutrition, and traditional gender roles. These issues must be addressed if we are to improve the lives of farmers and their families. There is a need for increased investment in agriculture, improved access to credit and loans, and better land tenure systems.    SECTION 6 MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY  There is perhaps no greater challenge than the loss of a loved one. Whether it be a parent, a sibling, a friend, or a partner, the grief and pain of losing someone close to us can be overwhelming. It can feel like our world has been turned upside down, and we may not know how to move forward. However, even in the darkest of times, I found it  possible to find strength, comfort, and hope after the death of my father. My own experience with the loss of a loved one taught me valuable lessons about life and helped me to find meaning in the midst of tragedy.  After losing my father , i felt isolated and alone. Friends and family may not know how to help, or they may avoid mentioning the loss for fear of upsetting me. This  led me to the feelings of loneliness and isolation. However I realized that it was  important to reach out to others, even if it's difficult, and to find ways to connect with others who have experienced a similar loss. Unfortunately i found a friend who was an orphan.There is strength in knowing that others understand and care.  It was hard for me  to imagine what life will look like after the loss of my father.  I felt  like my future is uncertain and that i don't know what to do next. I  also feit like my sense of purpose or meaning in life has been lost, but later realized that important to take time to grieve and to allow myself to heal. Over time, you i find a new sense of purpose and meaning, and a new direction for your life.This is because I had guardians who are always there for and they took care of all things in my life.   After my father has died, it was natural for me to worry that you will forget them and the memories you shared. But l do realize that it was  important to remember that forgetting is a normal part of the grieving process, and it doesn't mean that I  loved him any less. I can honor his meory by telling stories about him, keeping hismemory alive through photographs and mementos, and living your life in a way that would make him proud.  Grief is a natural and normal part of life, and it can be a difficult and confusing experience. The challenges and changes that come with losing a loved one can be overwhelming, but it is possible to find strength and resilience through the support of others and by focusing on the good memories and positive aspects of the person who has died. By facing the challenges of grief head-on, I found out  a way to honor my loved father's  memory and move forward with my own life. So, this is indeed my inspirational story when I faced many challenges but I found a way to overcame them and move on with my life.

130 - 15 Dec 2023 04:14PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

132 - 15 Dec 2023 04:22PM - +263 78 194 2292: Okay I understand they can't afford to pay 2000 U.S. but if it was 1000U.S.  they will afford ..
133 - 15 Dec 2023 04:41PM - Kunal: I can understand *This cost is paid in two equal installments.Each installment is paid before a semester.There are two semesters in a year*
134 - 15 Dec 2023 04:41PM - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further. And do you know how that is done?

48 - 15 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Kunal: Good to hear that As we've thoroughly covered your course details, and since you are aware Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
49 - 15 Dec 2023 03:50PM - +265 999 16 09 41: No. Please help
50 - 15 Dec 2023 04:02PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

52 - 15 Dec 2023 04:23PM - +265 999 16 09 41: The figure looks good but the challenge is our currency is too low and our salary is in mwk hence converting it looks too big. Considering the fact that you are only allowing two instalments.
53 - 15 Dec 2023 04:43PM - Kunal: I can understand So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further. And do you know how that is done?
54 - 15 Dec 2023 06:21PM - Kunal: Are we connected?
55 - 15 Dec 2023 06:33PM - +265 999 24 46 84: This is interesting especially on earning scholarship credits. Let me know how this is done?
56 - 15 Dec 2023 06:34PM - +265 999 24 46 84: We are connected still
57 - 15 Dec 2023 06:34PM - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the  *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.",No,No

To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it

105 - 15 Dec 2023 01:04PM - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams.

107 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
108 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - Kunal: <Media omitted>
109 - 15 Dec 2023 01:46PM - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

100 - 15 Dec 2023 03:46PM - Kunal: Indeed If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

64 - 15 Dec 2023 05:58PM - Kunal: Let me help you understand
65 - 15 Dec 2023 05:58PM - Kunal: While quantity surveying and geography may seem distinct, there can be connections between the two fields, especially in areas related to construction and infrastructure development. Here are some ways in which a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Geography could be linked to quantity surveying:  Spatial Analysis in Construction Planning: Geography students often acquire skills in spatial analysis and mapping. These skills can be valuable in construction planning, where understanding the geographical context of a project site is crucial. Quantity surveyors may use geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze and visualize data related to construction projects.  Environmental Impact Assessment: Geography students often study environmental issues. In construction projects, especially large-scale ones, environmental impact assessments are essential. Quantity surveyors working on such projects may collaborate with individuals who have a background in geography to assess and mitigate environmental impacts.  Urban Planning and Development: Geography students with a focus on urban studies may have insights into urban planning principles. Quantity surveyors involved in construction projects within urban areas may benefit from understanding the spatial and social dynamics of the built environment.  Infrastructure Development: Geography encompasses the study of physical landscapes. Understanding the physical geography of an area is crucial for infrastructure development. Quantity surveyors may work with geographic data to assess the terrain, geological conditions, and other factors influencing construction costs.  Sustainable Construction Practices: Geography students with a focus on sustainability can contribute to quantity surveying projects that prioritize environmentally friendly and sustainable construction practices. This collaboration can lead to more eco-conscious and cost-effective solutions.

40 - 15 Dec 2023 05:59PM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

77 - 15 Dec 2023 07:49AM - +263 77 268 6147: Good morning Edoofa team,my name is Herbert Mutanda a father to Arnold.  I have gone through your discussion With my son on various areas.He answered you very well but there are some areas which I need to revisit.  You noted that you offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees which is very commendable. Arnold has 3  other siblings who need to be taken care of back home,as a result given the the scenario of Zimbabwe's economic situation,I don't think as parents of Arnold we will manage transport and living costs based on our earnings.  I suggest if you have a special package for those who are less privileged,you may help by adding his name on that list.  On the issue of tuition fees,you only mentioned that you offer 50-100% but I don't know the actual tuition fees I have to pay on top of your provision.  Thank you.

39 - 15 Dec 2023 01:58PM - Pallika Edoofa: And May I know why the grades are low?
40 - 15 Dec 2023 02:04PM - +263 78 160 7693: Those subjects have a lot of concepts and information that one has to appreciate, know and apply.  The application part of it is a bit challenging to me and hence it caused the other grades to be low.
41 - 15 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I understand!
42 - 15 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
96 - 15 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.  So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
97 - 15 Dec 2023 06:18PM - +263 78 160 7693: They are thrilled
98 - 15 Dec 2023 06:19PM - Pallika Edoofa: Taboka, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
99 - 15 Dec 2023 06:19PM - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university  Isn't it?
100 - 15 Dec 2023 06:29PM - +263 78 160 7693: Yes it is
101 - 15 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
102 - 15 Dec 2023 06:53PM - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.  So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
103 - 15 Dec 2023 06:53PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
104 - 15 Dec 2023 06:53PM - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?

201 - 15 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your *-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *-Earn While You Learn Program and training* *-University sessions and interactions* *-A guaranteed scholarship seat* *-Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
202 - 15 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
203 - 15 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.   *Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.   *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).   *Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

360 - 15 Dec 2023 10:55AM - +263 71 215 5724: good morning, we are good thanks
361 - 15 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
362 - 15 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
363 - 15 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

290 - 15 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 77 266 9460: Thank you Discussions were mainly on the understanding about Edoofa and all the eligibility criteria and stages. We learnt alot during the past days as we learnt about the Edoofa family (student community) and that it also values the family of the learner s parents involvement. Conditions for eligibility before and after COVID pandemic, which resulted in a number of changes, (2passes at Alevel and reduced application fees), to mention a few. We also discussed the field of study, that even though we had Civil Engineering as main study, ideas were shared and eventually we opted for the Bachelors of Planning Advantages of studying in India were discussed, and alot was explained in detail. Fellow parents and students from Zimbabwe contacts were shared for opportunity to discuss and have further insight. The costs comparisons were also done, that included the advantages of Edoofa study and its main advantages like the Earn While you Learn. The application fees payment timelines were also explained that in 7days, the payment should be made.  Going forward, a few questions arose and if we may be assisted will be grateful.  1. If a student does not have Physics but wish to study Civil Engineering, are there any pre-modules to take? 2. In summary what are the fees required, after scholarship amounts are given? 3. Any requirements, like International English ? Finally, we thank you for your time and efforts to help us study, we are very grateful for this opportunity

437 - 15 Dec 2023 07:01PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
284 - 14 Dec 2023 04:52PM - +263 77 557 0270: Alright I got it
285 - 15 Dec 2023 11:02AM - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
286 - 15 Dec 2023 11:49AM - +263 77 557 0270: Ok I'm following
287 - 15 Dec 2023 11:49AM - +263 77 557 0270: Morning
288 - 15 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*  However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
289 - 15 Dec 2023 12:26PM - +263 77 557 0270: Ok of course that will be flexible for African parents
290 - 15 Dec 2023 12:40PM - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
291 - 15 Dec 2023 02:23PM - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh in brief let me say, Edoofa program is trying by all means to reduce amounts so that they become affordable for every student and by this it is reducing every amount from school fees  even up to application fee.So Edoofa is managing to make students pay their finances on their own by the EWYL program whereby students get to gain a practical approach on some jobs whilst earning money so that they reduce expenses for their parents
292 - 15 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350   *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

309 - 15 Dec 2023 08:44AM - +263 77 618 3973: How much maybe the 12.5% transfer charges
310 - 15 Dec 2023 11:04AM - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning How are you doing today?
311 - 15 Dec 2023 11:22AM - +263 77 618 3973: 1 am good. Thank you
312 - 15 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
313 - 15 Dec 2023 12:18PM - +263 77 618 3973: Yes that may help me sir. Thank you
314 - 15 Dec 2023 12:38PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

Entering a foreign academic system can even expose them to new ways of thinking and problem solving. This will not only help them when they get to the collegiate level, but it will also develop the kind of knowledge and skills that can contribute to their careers, especially if they end up working for multi-national businesses.

92 - 15 Dec 2023 11:58AM - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, Let me assist you with same,  *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
93 - 15 Dec 2023 11:58AM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
94 - 15 Dec 2023 11:58AM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

97 - 15 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

109 - 15 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.",No,No

Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

117 - 14 Dec 2023 05:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.  I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

125 - 15 Dec 2023 03:40PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

79 - 15 Dec 2023 11:21AM - Shubham Madhwal: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

97 - 15 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Kenneth, as you are now aware, the reason why we recommend India as a higher education destination for your higher education, So I am sure your friend Persistance must have also briefed you about the cost of Education here in India after you were aware of the Edoofa scholarship and also about the Earn While You Learn Program.  Can you comment about them in 100-200 words, So that I can get your understanding about the same and assist you accordingly? <This message was edited>
98 - 15 Dec 2023 01:08PM - +263 78 246 5302: The cost of education in India after an Edoofa scholarship program is reduced to $1500-3000. This cost can be reduced through the Earn While You Learn program that allows students to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their tuition fees. Earn While You Learn program prepares students that are job-ready. The program helps students get online opportunities to learn employability skills.EWYL help build technical skills like digital marketing, organization, management and soft skills. This EWYL can give students a head start in their careers and help them to build up their resume. It can give students a sense of independence and responsibility.
99 - 15 Dec 2023 01:44PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great Answer Kenneth, I can clearly see that you are aware that the cost of education in India is Around $6000-$8000, After which the cost is reduced to  $2000-$3000, you also have a great understanding of the Earn While You Learn program.  So My next question to you would be, since there is no limit to the amount that a student can earn at the EWYL program, how many scholarship credits do you plan to earn per month so that you can assist your mother by reducing her financial burden for your education?
100 - 15 Dec 2023 01:47PM - +263 78 246 5302: As many as i can, sir.
101 - 15 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, And I really appreciate and admire your enthusiasm for the same. My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English.

Rwanda has experienced a number of long term effects of which some are that many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual  violence  thousands of children were opharned and had to fend for themselves .Countless survivors develop long term psychological problems . However overtime Rwanda rebuilt itself and survivors played an important role in it's development.Rwanda has alos had some economic problems after the genocide of which some include the decline in the gross domestic product in three out of five years posting a rapid decline at more than fourty percent in  nineteen ninty four the year of the genocide.The nine percent increase in nineteen ninty five the  first postwar year signolled the economic. with this this information you can see a bite of the information on how Rwanda was sixteen years after the gencide .  Section 6 I as child have always wanted to be like doctor Lubinda who is a well  known doctor once a Njase girl just like me .  Her determination, belief and motivation in herself which are the aspects that have helped her push to being a successful lady she is  today . Though she was a simple girl on average she made sure she worked very had at school just so that she could be the One who brings change to her family so that they can live better live .she started off as a simple doctor and later  decided to start her own hospital which later developed into many other hospitals in different countries meaning she is industrious not only in Zambia but also in other countries like south Africa and Pakistan too.Her achievement also bust me to believe in myself and be self driven and also make decision to build me not to break me . Though doctor Lubinda was judged for her decision to retire and start her own and also criticized at the same  time she was determined  and she never turned back or changed her mind about it as she had a vision for herself being very successful and rich which Inturn came true and she is now very well to do till date .She even sponsors the vulnerable as well .for this reason her life story become my inspiration to be the best in what I do and also to stick to what I believe in.

12 - 13 Dec 2023 06:15PM - +263 78 749 4463: My name is Munashe Gladys Chibanda ,first born girl child in a family of 2 children. I am 17 years old currently preparing for  upper six in 2024 at Lady Enarater International high school which is located in Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe.Lady Enarater high school is a reliable International private school which is paid USD 1300 per term. I am doing science subjects which are  maths,chemistry and biology because I believe that I am going to be a successful neurosurgeon in the next few years to come ,why? because i know there are lot of people out there who have debilitating conditions in our country and there are a few neurosurgeon who can help them so I believe I will be at help too if I was to add the number of neurosurgeon in our country and would gladly would be at help if i am to become International too. For my strengths ,my leadership skills are quite breathe taking says spectators' feedback because currently am a leader at Lady Enarater International high school, teamwork too,problem solving and communication too can count as I am seeing myself being a therapist and a neurosurgeon too. As for my weaknesses ,one of them is being a highly sensitive person as I sometimes consider other people 's emotions rather than mine. i am into music and reading a lot of books during my free time. As I mentioned above ,I am the first born child in a family of two children, where the last born is a 11 year old boy at primary level right now preparing for his final year at primary level.My father and mother have been financially supporting my education ever since I stepped my way in kindergarten and they will  continue to do so until I'm in my graduation gown,but I also have plans in supporting them too as time goes by.My father is a pharmacy sales representative and my mother is a hair dresser who  Try their best everyday for our wellbeing.

148 - 15 Dec 2023 12:36PM - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  *I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*

153 - 15 Dec 2023 02:32PM - Tushti: Thamani, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
154 - 15 Dec 2023 02:36PM - +263 77 646 0816: The student may end up spending $1 500 to $2 250

155 - 15 Dec 2023 02:37PM - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.  *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.  *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years.

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.  A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.  *Required Skill-Set for BA LLB* It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly.

179 - 15 Dec 2023 10:23AM - Tushti: Meanwhile, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
180 - 15 Dec 2023 10:23AM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
181 - 15 Dec 2023 10:23AM - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
204 - 15 Dec 2023 10:32AM - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
205 - 15 Dec 2023 10:33AM - +263 78 779 9874: Yes I think they are online
206 - 15 Dec 2023 10:34AM - +263 77 889 4255: I'm also online
207 - 15 Dec 2023 10:37AM - Tushti: @263778894255 Did you understand the cost of education in India? Do yo feel it would be affordable for the family to send the twins to India?
208 - 15 Dec 2023 10:40AM - +263 77 889 4255: Yes I understood ma'am and it is affordable to send them  to India
209 - 15 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Tushti: Noted
210 - 15 Dec 2023 10:57AM - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent  would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
211 - 15 Dec 2023 10:57AM - +263 78 779 9874: That's no problem
212 - 15 Dec 2023 10:58AM - Tushti: Pride, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
213 - 15 Dec 2023 10:59AM - +263 78 779 9874: $1500-$2250
