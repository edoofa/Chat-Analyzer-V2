153 - 20 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
154 - 20 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
155 - 20 Dec 2023 01:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
156 - 20 Dec 2023 01:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -  1. What‚Äôs your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter? 2. What‚Äôs the Standard Duration of your course? 3. What‚Äôs the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)? 4. What‚Äôs the Registration fee?

As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*  After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950.

103 - 20 Dec 2023 02:52PM - +263 78 057 5394: I have a question though, you said my results are sent to various universities meaning there is a chance of other universities to send offer letters which i can choose from besides GGI
104 - 20 Dec 2023 02:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
105 - 20 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.
106 - 20 Dec 2023 02:55PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok then we can proceed
107 - 20 Dec 2023 03:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
108 - 20 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-  1) What‚Äôs your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter? 3) You‚Äôll also notice the ‚ÄòRegistration Fee‚Äô mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you‚Äôre supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
109 - 20 Dec 2023 03:41PM - +263 78 057 5394: Tuition fee is $1 200 annual Accomodation is also $1 200 Then the registration fee is $750 which will be reduced to $650 due to endowment plan
110 - 20 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.  In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates. <This message was edited>

112 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200.  The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
113 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship.  This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?

Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.

I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos.  *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.

Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward.

Civil law is  quite different from criminal law . lam more interested in  civil law as it covers a wide range of non criminal disputes which include contract disputes, property disputes , personal injury claims and many more. They are many reasons as to why lam more interested in civil law and the reasons include ,civil law  typically offers a great chance of monetary compensation compared to criminal law and by any chance if l win a   civil case you might end up being awarded with money to compensate for your losses , secondly civil cases are less time consuming as they are resolved faster compared to criminal cases , thirdly civil cases are typically less emotional draining comparing with criminal cases and as for me l do not like  to be emotionally drained  with cases

Firstly l have good communication skills because a lawyer has to be a good communicartor both verbally and in writing , for instance  if a lawyer has all the evidence needed but cannot  communicate well the chances of winning a case becomes low . Furthermore l possess the skills of problem solving and critical thinking , l think this skill is important as a lawyer sometimes deals with tricky cases and inorder to win the case one has to be a critical thinker and l also have the ability to think out of the box . In addition l also have strong research skills and l can even work under pressure and also lam a very organized person. Most importantly l have a passion for justice and lam committed in helping others.

153 - 20 Dec 2023 08:04PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
154 - 20 Dec 2023 08:07PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes that is accurate
155 - 20 Dec 2023 08:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
158 - 20 Dec 2023 08:10PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam
159 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.  *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
160 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
161 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
162 - 20 Dec 2023 08:37PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes we do wish to have that
163 - 20 Dec 2023 08:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos.  *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
150 - 20 Dec 2023 07:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
151 - 20 Dec 2023 07:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
152 - 20 Dec 2023 07:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
153 - 20 Dec 2023 07:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?",No,Yes,N,,

166 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
167 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
168 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?

149 - 20 Dec 2023 07:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Thank you for providing the details with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.  However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
150 - 20 Dec 2023 07:15PM - +263 77 455 3293: Sir the payment we were supposed to do isn't it $350 ? If so we have paid in full . We can resend the proof of payment.
151 - 20 Dec 2023 07:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. There was a clerical error on our end. Yes you have paid the full amount, please.
152 - 20 Dec 2023 07:20PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok sir thank you
153 - 20 Dec 2023 07:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?

To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
154 - 20 Dec 2023 07:21PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct
155 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
156 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
157 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
158 - 20 Dec 2023 07:50PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir you can elaborate further
159 - 20 Dec 2023 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.  *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
154 - 20 Dec 2023 07:21PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct

They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
160 - 20 Dec 2023 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.  Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?

341 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - +263 78 524 4399: But as u said tt it leads me to be an mining engineer
342 - 20 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Austin: Mining is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world‚Äôs economy, it is unclear whether mining will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line.  One of the primary reasons why mining may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world‚Äôs reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment.  Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining and other professionals in the field.  In conclusion, mining may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.

48 - 20 Dec 2023 09:21AM - Garima Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

119 - 20 Dec 2023 08:39AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone! ‚ÄúThere are no shortcuts to any place worth going.‚Äù Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

121 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
122 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
123 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
124 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
125 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

173 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
174 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
175 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
176 - 20 Dec 2023 03:56PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes that's it
177 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Gurvinder: Alright Birthwell, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
178 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes
179 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
180 - 20 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +263 73 815 1871: No not yet but we are planning to discuss it
181 - 20 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
190 - 20 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
191 - 20 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Gurvinder: Birthwell basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
192 - 20 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
193 - 20 Dec 2023 04:47PM - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
194 - 20 Dec 2023 07:05PM - +263 73 815 1871: The network here is bad

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

31 - 20 Dec 2023 09:58AM - +260 97 7693941: Indeed.  As the mother  to charity,  I would  certainly  like  this  for my daughter  .
32 - 20 Dec 2023 10:33AM - +260 97 7693941: It would  really help  us financially considering  that my husband  has be a kidney  patient  for some time now and it has affected  our financial  stability.
33 - 20 Dec 2023 11:24AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Mulonda, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
34 - 20 Dec 2023 12:06PM - +260 97 7693941: Well! I would  have loved  my daughter  to get the scholarship but  after  reading this  I don't seem  to qualify because  I've  not been  consistent  on the counselling  stage due to circumstances  beyond  my control  and the other  reason  is that am not home with my family for them to be present throughout  the counseling and eligibility process.  So with this in mind, I don't know how Edoofa could be of help in this kind of  a scenario. <This message was edited>

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly.

62 - 20 Dec 2023 01:54PM - +263 71 597 4800: I was studying sciences, Maths, physics , chemistry and statistics
63 - 20 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Gurvinder: Please, I mean you were studying A- level?
64 - 20 Dec 2023 02:06PM - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , i was studying A level
65 - 20 Dec 2023 02:11PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
72 - 20 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study aerospace engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
73 - 20 Dec 2023 03:15PM - +263 71 597 4800: -So, I started form three at Kenzim from 2018, wrote my O level finals there and then did A level untill final as well in 2021 - From form 1, I was in Buhera at St Moses the prophet secondary up to 2017, then after my grandfather died I moved here in Harare
74 - 20 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
75 - 20 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Gurvinder: Please address this.
76 - 20 Dec 2023 03:49PM - +263 71 597 4800: It wasn't always what I thought, I wanted to be a pilot and I loved physics ever since I got introduced to it, when I got to A level it was the only thing that was challenging enough. So my accounts teacher , who always encouraged and believed in me asked me what I wanted to do now that I am about to complete A level, my answer was to be a pilot. He told me that was going to be not big enough compared to what I could do with my A level. I thought I love planes , why don't I build them. I had a dream to one day land with a giant plane, just as a surprise ,in my grandfather's field in the rurals. It even got better to build something that I may or may not fly, but certainly love, which is challenging enough.
77 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Gurvinder: It's amazing how your passion for planes and physics led you to consider a career in aeronautical engineering or aircraft design. Sometimes, unexpected guidance or suggestions can open up new perspectives, redirecting us towards paths that resonate even more with our capabilities and aspirations.
78 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
79 - 20 Dec 2023 04:18PM - +263 71 597 4800: No, not one.
80 - 20 Dec 2023 04:30PM - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
81 - 20 Dec 2023 04:39PM - +263 71 597 4800: <Media omitted>
104 - 20 Dec 2023 05:19PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa‚Äôs Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
105 - 20 Dec 2023 05:42PM - +263 71 597 4800: I see myself as an innovative aerospace engineer growing in my career and seizing every opportunity to be better. Bringing new ideas into the field. Building amazing teams and bringing the best of ideas  into the world. And what I really care about the most is making a positive net contribution. I see myself influencing young minds of that time to do great things despite their backgrounds.
106 - 20 Dec 2023 06:00PM - +263 71 597 4800: It's not very easy for me to pursue a tertiary education given my family's circumstances, so an opportunity with edoofa is a big positive, given that it's an experience of living and learning abroad with an opportunity to work. It is all an opportunity to grow and certainly having other students who are like me is a connecting point for lasting relations and connections which are meaningful. As well as the leadership of edoofa means proper guidance in terms of career development and opportunities to develop the leadership muscle inside me I believe
107 - 20 Dec 2023 06:32PM - +263 71 597 4800: As for confidence about achieving above 2 points Mr Gurvinder, I have passed my A levels

31 - 20 Dec 2023 09:36AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
32 - 20 Dec 2023 09:36AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
33 - 20 Dec 2023 09:37AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
34 - 20 Dec 2023 09:37AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

25 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
26 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

33 - 20 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Fumani, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
34 - 20 Dec 2023 12:23PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I would like to believe I meet these two significant metrics to potentially obtain a higher quantum of Scholarship
35 - 20 Dec 2023 12:25PM - +263 77 341 0203: I am currently as Proactive as Possible in the counselling session and My Guardian is Currently active online

78 - 20 Dec 2023 05:00PM - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are: *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates. *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client‚Äôs perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court. *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor. *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job. *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding. A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

69 - 20 Dec 2023 03:05PM - +260 96 5422579: In Five years after studying B.com I also see myself as being an integral part of society and being able to contribute to the growth and marketing business at large. I am positive and determined that with Edoofa ,I would be dedicated to my school profession and deliver the best while learning from the best.Having said that I see myself demonstrating my leadership skills
70 - 20 Dec 2023 03:14PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Kasonde I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

72 - 20 Dec 2023 03:29PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
73 - 20 Dec 2023 03:49PM - +260 96 5422579: I would prefer studying abroad because I feel I would have a greater exposure to technology and equipment needed for me to study.And this will also help me to interact with people of different cultures
74 - 20 Dec 2023 04:05PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
75 - 20 Dec 2023 04:28PM - +260 96 5422579: With the knowledge and and skills I would obtain from learning abroad I would use that as a key to contribute to the growth of the education system.
76 - 20 Dec 2023 04:33PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Kasonde, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
77 - 20 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +260 96 5422579: I agree
78 - 20 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
111 - 20 Dec 2023 05:07PM - +260 96 5422579: Okay Notted
112 - 20 Dec 2023 05:10PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
113 - 20 Dec 2023 05:10PM - +260 96 5422579: Yes please
114 - 20 Dec 2023 05:12PM - Gurvinder: Kasonde, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in. <This message was edited>

79 - 20 Dec 2023 03:58PM - +260 767735131: Thank you so much, so according to what I had said earlier about journalism not being common in Zambia, I feel in five years time after doing the course, I could easily get a job and since it deals with the media people would easily be communicated to about it and take keen interest in it and also be encouraged to do the same course. Me getting into the Edoofa's program can really help me both financially and academically because I would not have to wait for my parents to first find money to enroll me into tertiary education but instead Edoofa can and that can be an achievement on its own. Secondly, in accordance to the course I've chosen which is journalism and mass communication, the Edoofa program can be the first thing I can want to talk about seeing that I can be dealing with the media and communication and lastly this can really help me achieve my dreams seeing that I have become what I've always wanted to.
80 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Kulela, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

84 - 20 Dec 2023 04:46PM - +260 767735131: With the course I want to do I feel its not taken that much serious in Zambia like I said earlier and I feel they don't Carter everything

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

I learnt that Edoofar program is a scholarship initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions, i was further told that it covers 50-100% tutution fees. I also learnt that the program works closely with local ambassadors for more clarity....Furthermore, l was l also advised about the program of Earn While You Learn whereby a student will be enhancing his or her skills on the field of study
12 - 20 Dec 2023 02:21PM - +263 77 138 2796: Further on the issue of EWYL program, l also learnt that it helps students earn credits to fund their higher education
16 - 20 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

17 - 20 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you so much very clear
19 - 20 Dec 2023 02:44PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Member, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 20 Dec 2023 02:49PM - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you...yes l think l have what it takes to meet these 2 significant metrics

May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

199 - 20 Dec 2023 09:43AM - Gurvinder: Molline, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
200 - 20 Dec 2023 09:44AM - +263 78 698 8605: Ohhhhh okay
201 - 20 Dec 2023 09:45AM - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact figure.
214 - 20 Dec 2023 09:52AM - +263 78 698 8605: No enlighten me
215 - 20 Dec 2023 09:52AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
216 - 20 Dec 2023 09:53AM - Gurvinder: Alright Molline, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
217 - 20 Dec 2023 09:53AM - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
218 - 20 Dec 2023 09:54AM - +263 78 698 8605: Yes l do
219 - 20 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
220 - 20 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
221 - 20 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

As weird and  bad looking of the name of the village , the village is just like it , it is an eyesore.  From that eyesore village, originated me a person who is willing to make something in life. My dream started in a way nobody could imagine . In a brief we can just say a well wisher who helped some orphan  kids of my community was and is still my motive.  In the course of helping those kids he got to a point he narrated his life story to the people. In the narration he mentioned he started like me living a low life in a neglected-like village with his grandparents. He had to walk a very long distance to school and sometimes get fired from school because he had not paid school fees. To counter that problem he had to do some piece jobs while going to school . From his explanation you could tell on your own that life was not a smooth flow for that person but he still made it in life .  That gave me courage and strength that I would make it. To be honest hope was not anywhere to be found that time because my parents were not yet employed and the jobs were not easy get. Getting a job was difficult ,morelike cutting an ignite rock with a nail cutter.  So I had to strive my primary school reading and studying very hard going to school not to waste any time , trying to utilize every dollar my parents had paid school fees because I knew they had not earn that money easily .  It was then when I was about to enter secondary school ( high school) my parents got lucky or I should say by God's mercy they got employed in the Ministry of education . They managed to keep sending me to school but it was hard and it is still hard for I am not the only kid in my family who need to go to school . My siblings also need that privilege so that made me consider looking for assistance in form scholarships and well-wishers like I am doing now. This will help me achieve my dream and reduce the burden of school fees from my parents. Not forgetting the motive from the well wisher , I want to be successful in life so that my kids and my circle of influence will not suffer the same problems I suffered that time .  That made me who I am now . Aiming to achieve something in life . Who knows maybe one day , I will be one person's motive as well. <This message was edited>

102 - 20 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*

103 - 20 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

105 - 20 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4.

109 - 20 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +263 71 297 5426: Ok Sir
110 - 20 Dec 2023 02:00PM - Gurvinder: Nicole, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program.

177 - 20 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ntali, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
16 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17 - 20 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 78 529 0151: Yaa true
18 - 20 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Makamure, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey.

Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.  The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.  However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.

118 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
119 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
120 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

172 - 20 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
173 - 20 Dec 2023 04:04PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes, and this is something I have been looking for
174 - 20 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Gurvinder: Alright Tawananyasha, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
175 - 20 Dec 2023 04:24PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes, they are the ones who will be supporting me.
176 - 20 Dec 2023 04:32PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
177 - 20 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes

45 - 20 Dec 2023 03:10PM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

59 - 20 Dec 2023 06:27PM - Harmehak: So Atoness, what all did you research regarding medicine?  Along with the same what did you research regarding medicine in India and its requirements?
60 - 20 Dec 2023 06:34PM - +27 64 981 6126: I know that medicine requires one to have high marks especially in science subjects, a lot of students tend to drop medicine because it is a bit challenging.
61 - 20 Dec 2023 06:39PM - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing and that is quite true as well!  And what did you research regarding the requirements to pursue medicine in India?
62 - 20 Dec 2023 06:53PM - +27 64 981 6126: Academic qualifications: To secure MBBS admission in India, candidates must have passed class 12 from a recognised board. Subjects studied: To pursue an MBBS course, students should have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in their class 11 and 12. One must be 18-25 yrs
63 - 20 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Harmehak: I understand!
64 - 20 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:  *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  *2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .  *3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
65 - 20 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like  *1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology* *2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy* *3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy* *4. Bachelors in Optometry* *5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*  These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
66 - 20 Dec 2023 07:59PM - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

374 - 20 Dec 2023 10:52AM - +263 77 948 9673: Next year February?
375 - 20 Dec 2023 12:22PM - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity.
376 - 20 Dec 2023 12:23PM - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

112 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Harmehak: You see, Lisa, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.

262 - 20 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Harmehak: Makanaka, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
263 - 20 Dec 2023 05:07PM - +263 78 105 2450: More than 1000

47 - 20 Dec 2023 06:21PM - Harmehak: Pauseland, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
48 - 20 Dec 2023 07:40PM - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30 - 20 Dec 2023 09:07AM - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic‚Äôs Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO‚Äôs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony‚Äôs, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others.

53 - 20 Dec 2023 05:49PM - +27 68 272 6969: Does the scholarship cover tuition fees, accommodation, food, medical and travel expenses
54 - 20 Dec 2023 05:52PM - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days.

21 - 20 Dec 2023 02:27PM - +263 73 396 6544: I'm 19 years old and I finished my Advanced level final exams this year. Matthew Rusike College charged 498USD per term. I wish to study Computer Science. I was never good in Accounting which makes it my major weakness. I enjoy watching football on my free times . I come from a family of 5. My father is a salesman at Powerlink Trucks and my mother is self employed, she sells school uniforms. I have 2 older sisters Wadzanayi and Vimbai
22 - 20 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tongai Jr, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!  I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!  May I know more about your elder siblings please?

26 - 20 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Harmehak: Well Tongai Jr now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!  Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27 - 20 Dec 2023 03:09PM - +263 73 396 6544: Yes indeed
28 - 20 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?

30 - 20 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Harmehak: Tongai Jr, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!  So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
31 - 20 Dec 2023 03:18PM - +263 73 396 6544: Yes they are
32 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
33 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
34 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
35 - 20 Dec 2023 04:17PM - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Computer sciences?

57 - 20 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

90 - 20 Dec 2023 10:28AM - +263 77 266 4290: India is home to high rated institution known for their academic excellence and quality of education and we'll displine to our girl child.
91 - 20 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
92 - 20 Dec 2023 10:36AM - +263 77 266 4290: Sure she will learn alot.lam not going to afford without any schoolar ship
93 - 20 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further. And do you know how that is done?
97 - 20 Dec 2023 11:26AM - +263 77 266 4290: So l choose this one 2000-3000 per semester.lam happy to hear that it can provides work to the students to reduceng their fees

42 - 20 Dec 2023 12:38PM - +263 77 296 6469: I am not aware of the cost
43 - 20 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
44 - 20 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Kunal: <Media omitted>
45 - 20 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.",No,Yes,N,,

18 - 20 Dec 2023 09:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: Charmaine is lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of her friend *Persistance* who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Did her friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer?
19 - 20 Dec 2023 09:16AM - +263 77 340 4312: Not in detail, but l would love to hear from you thank you.
20 - 20 Dec 2023 09:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Charity, Please let me share some information with you.
21 - 20 Dec 2023 09:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
97 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
98 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
99 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
100 - 20 Dec 2023 02:46PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.    *So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
101 - 20 Dec 2023 07:27PM - +263 78 635 4785: yes very much affordable thank you
102 - 20 Dec 2023 08:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.",No,No,N,,

However please Note by Tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.

Earning while learning
110 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

116 - 20 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,No,N,,

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,Yes,N,,

20 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.
21 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic‚Äôs Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David‚Äôs Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony‚Äôs, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years.    The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.  *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*

64 - 20 Dec 2023 01:10PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, I just had a discussion with our team and the course is currently unavailable, the only option for you in the Medical field of Diploma would be a Diploma in Medical Lab Technology.

67 - 20 Dec 2023 02:20PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, I will be guiding regarding the same in the further session.
68 - 20 Dec 2023 02:21PM - Pallika Edoofa: Firstly, I would like to know if you want to continue with this course?
103 - 20 Dec 2023 04:14PM - +263 71 915 0476: I think it is a perfect opportunity. Yes, l think l would benefit from this program
104 - 20 Dec 2023 04:15PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
105 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - +263 71 915 0476: Yes, l do understand
106 - 20 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
107 - 20 Dec 2023 04:23PM - +263 71 915 0476: I like point number 2 Affordability
108 - 20 Dec 2023 05:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: Great!  Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

Can you please tell me: *1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?* *2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kelvin ?*
24 - 20 Dec 2023 09:17AM - +263 78 195 0427: 1)Well what motivated me to apply for the schoolarship program firstly was the Edoofa schoolarship program covering 50-80% of all expenses for my stay and learning in Indian and secondly quality education that statistics has shown is very high in India with a lot of diverse opportunities for success and lastly am a huge fan of the Indian culture and traditions so this came as an opportunity for me to learn more about the nation  2)*The Edoofa Scholarship Program*  ‚ñ´Ô∏èThe Edoofa Scholarship Program is a transformative initiative aimed at providing *Quality International Tertiary* Education to deserving students, particularly from Africa. ‚ñ´Ô∏èManaged by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* Pvt. Ltd. founded by *Mr.Angad and Mr.Avreen Singh* , the program addresses the challenges of both *affordability* and *employability* that many students face in pursuing tertiary education. ‚Ä¢Key Features of the Edoofa Scholarship Program  ‚Ä¢Imagine having the opportunity to pursue your dream education without the burden of very high tuition fees. ‚Ä¢Edoofa provides scholarships covering 50-80% of tuition costs, ensuring that financial constraints don't stand between you and a Quality International Education. Studying in India without the scholarship granted by Edoofa is way too expensive and may cost around $7000-$8000 per year But once I saw that with the Edoofa schoolarship program I would need a range of *$2000-$3000* per year including all academic and living expenses. ‚Ä¢Through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa gives you the opportunity to alleviate the financial burden even more, by participating in online projects and earning scholarship credits <This message was edited>",No,No,N,,

61 - 20 Dec 2023 09:01AM - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering Tatenda's subjects, interests, and passion, Tatenda is eligible to pursue   *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)*    Do you want me to explain the course in depth?

63 - 20 Dec 2023 11:27AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)* is a 3-year duration undergraduate program for students who wish to pursue their career in Journalism and media industry.  The Career Options and Job opportunities are very high with the media sector. A student who has completed B.J.M.C can work with the news channels, news magazines, publication houses, Media is a connection between the population and the world.

87 - 20 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
88 - 20 Dec 2023 04:12PM - +263 77 352 3598: Its ok
89 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Beatrice, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

651 - 20 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Sahil Edoofa: Raymond, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?

We had a long counseling session with the whole family while trying to stabilize the impact of crushed dreams, not only in relation to Stacey's future education but that of her siblings as well, all as a result from the employer's actions. Admittedly Edoofa had provided an excellent opportunity for our daughter's progression but it is a hard decision to any father to choose to abandon it at such a crucial point.  I'm sure you appreciate the situation that he finds himself in and support him in wishing him a good recovery prospect which will see him realizing his dreams of seeing his daughter come out better, which we believe will come about still

171 - 20 Dec 2023 02:47PM - +263 78 005 4440: Mechanical engineering can be a great way to fulfill someone's aspirations by giving them the opportunity to design and build machines and systems that make a difference in the world. Mechanical engineers might work on projects that improve people's lives, like creating medical devices that help patients, developing new energy sources, or designing safer and more efficient vehicles. Mechanical engineers also have the opportunity to be creative and innovative, while also using their analytical and problem-solving skills to make a positive impact on society. In addition to fulfilling my  aspirations, mechanical engineering can also be a very rewarding and fulfilling career path in its own right. Mechanical engineers get to see the results of their work in the real world, which can be very satisfying. I will  also get to work with a variety of different technologies and learn new things every day. Additionally, mechanical engineering is a stable and well-paying career, with opportunities for advancement and growth.
172 - 20 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether that aligns with your future plans, please? I would love to know what is your desired job role, Auther.
173 - 20 Dec 2023 03:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: If I had to describe both of these courses in a single line. I would say that Civil Engineering is inclined towards Construction and Architecture whereas Mechanical Engineering deals with the aspects of Machinery and Automobiles.

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Blessed's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?

183 - 20 Dec 2023 05:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
184 - 20 Dec 2023 05:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
185 - 20 Dec 2023 05:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
186 - 20 Dec 2023 05:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
187 - 20 Dec 2023 06:06PM - +263 71 584 4314: Yes certainly I think this is very beneficial as it allows me to gain significant skill for me to stand out in the world at the same time allowing me to help me with my tuition fees
188 - 20 Dec 2023 06:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
189 - 20 Dec 2023 06:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
190 - 20 Dec 2023 06:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
191 - 20 Dec 2023 06:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

37 - 20 Dec 2023 02:54PM - +263 77 244 4376: I'm being realistic.
37 - 20 Dec 2023 02:54PM - +263 77 244 4376: I'm being realistic.
38 - 20 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Wilbert. After the scholarship, there is some miscellaneous amount. May I know who will be helping Ezra with that amount, please?
39 - 20 Dec 2023 03:02PM - +263 77 244 4376: No one other than me the father.
40 - 20 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Wilbert and Mrs. Patricia. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Ezra's well-being is truly admirable!
41 - 20 Dec 2023 03:08PM - +263 77 244 4376: We are always praying for his education. And in one way or another, God will extend His hand to Ezra's education.
42 - 20 Dec 2023 03:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of A level?
43 - 20 Dec 2023 03:59PM - +263 77 244 4376: Well, there must be a huddle. Ezra shall be writing his Advanced level in November 2024. He could have been quick to look for a scholarship before completing Advanced level. Concerning his termly report, he forgot his report book at Mutumba high when schools closed on the first day of December 2023.
44 - 20 Dec 2023 04:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies?
45 - 20 Dec 2023 04:25PM - +263 77 244 4376: Studying abroad would provide my son with a variety and enhances cultural exchange. It also quenches young generation's appetite for foreign education and lifestyles.
46 - 20 Dec 2023 04:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Wilbert! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills!
47 - 20 Dec 2023 04:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mr. Wilbert. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share his previous term results in a textual format?
48 - 20 Dec 2023 05:01PM - +263 77 244 4376: Fine, we shall comply.
49 - 20 Dec 2023 05:02PM - +263 77 244 4376: That is true.

Aside from work I do engage in farming activities, as it is a passion for myself.  What motivates me to support my daughter's education, is to see her became an impactful force in her career, to inspire other girls to believe that with hard work and an eye for success can get you to great heights. <This message was edited>
28 - 20 Dec 2023 01:23PM - +260 769913251: My name is Faith Chama, and I was a student at Dominican Convent Secondary School. I am writing to provide you with a formal introduction and to share some information about my educational background, achievements, and interests as requested. I am currently enrolled in grade 12 at Dominican Convent Secondary School, where I had a bit of some challenges with having a strong academic record but eventually became better and consistent. I am dedicated to my studies and have a passion for learning, which has been reflected in my academic performance. Throughout my school years, I have actively participated in various extracurricular activities, including netball, swimming and performing arts. These experiences have helped me develop skills in leadership, teamwork, and time management, which I believe are invaluable for my personal and academic growth. After initially aspiring to pursue a career in aviation, I have conscientiously reevaluated my ambitions and have chosen to focus on architectural engineering. This decision stems from a careful consideration of the opportunities and challenges associated with both fields, leading me to recognize the alignment of my skills and interests with the dynamic and diverse realm of architectural engineering. I am eager to immerse myself in this discipline and am committed to leveraging my strengths to build a meaningful and impactful career in this field. I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with you and to receive support as I navigate the next steps in my academic journey. I am eager to gain insights and advice that will help me make informed decisions about my future educational and career endeavors. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better, and I look forward to the prospect of working together as I pursue my educational and personal development.
29 - 20 Dec 2023 01:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your dedication to both your professional career and your passion for farming showcases a well-rounded individual with a diverse set of skills, Mr. Peros. As a Payroll Officer with a diploma in IT and a qualified ZiCA accountant, your expertise in financial matters is undoubtedly commendable. The fact that you engage in farming, not just as an activity but as a passion, adds a layer of commitment and resilience! Moreover, your motivation to support Faith's education reflects your vision for her success and your belief in the transformative power of education. Your aspiration to see her become an impactful force in her career and an inspiration to other girls is truly admirable. I have confidence that Faith is an exceptionally diligent student, and she will undoubtedly demonstrate her capabilities if given the right guidance!
30 - 20 Dec 2023 01:26PM - +260 96 9559186: Definitely üíØ Thank you so much üôèüèæ

341 - 20 Dec 2023 10:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Antonet. For the initial phase, a payment of $350 is required upon Isheanesu's eligibility confirmation for the program. The subsequent payment for tuition fees is scheduled for July-August next year.
342 - 20 Dec 2023 10:09AM - +260 761706007: Got you now thanks

349 - 20 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Antonet. You only have to start the financial process once Isheanesu is found eligible for the program, please. That includes an interview with the director. You will have sufficient time to accumulate the funds.
350 - 20 Dec 2023 10:30AM - +260 761706007: Thanks so you can go ahead
351 - 20 Dec 2023 10:31AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
352 - 20 Dec 2023 10:31AM - +260 761706007: <Media omitted>
353 - 20 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
354 - 20 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
355 - 20 Dec 2023 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
356 - 20 Dec 2023 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
357 - 20 Dec 2023 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
359 - 20 Dec 2023 10:58AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?

361 - 20 Dec 2023 10:59AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Antonet. However, you have to make the payments after 7 days, please.
362 - 20 Dec 2023 11:00AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After receiving the offer letter.
363 - 20 Dec 2023 11:58AM - +260 761706007: Can you delay your offer letter?
364 - 20 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what challenges are you facing, please?
365 - 20 Dec 2023 12:27PM - +260 761706007: You said after the offer letter you count 7 days ( the first payment) So want you to do so after I receivey payment - hope you get me right?
366 - 20 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that there are some challenges for you in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
367 - 20 Dec 2023 12:36PM - +260 761706007: Yes thanks a lot ,we do appreciate
368 - 20 Dec 2023 12:40PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Isheanesu's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Isheanesu's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
375 - 20 Dec 2023 01:04PM - +260 761706007: It's ok

Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?

198 - 20 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
199 - 20 Dec 2023 12:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.",No,No,N,,

243 - 20 Dec 2023 12:34PM - +263 77 992 5799: Yes I'm ready
244 - 20 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ngonidzashe!
245 - 20 Dec 2023 12:40PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
246 - 20 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +263 77 992 5799: I have definitely understood the information that was shared during the previous session. I am now aware of the benefits of enrolling in Edoofa's program, including the savings on services, such as visa documentation, university selection, and SLC classes. I understand that Edoofa is committed to helping students through every step of the process, and I'm confident that enrolling in the program will be a positive experience. I really appreciate you taking the time to share this information with me.
247 - 20 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
248 - 20 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
249 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.

242 - 20 Dec 2023 02:34PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Mnqobi's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it? <This message was edited>

391 - 20 Dec 2023 12:23PM - +263 77 298 9303: Not as such but would be  elated if those options were also available. In Zimbabwe a BA in Geography tends to be limiting someone to the teaching profession of which Tafara is not considering that
392 - 20 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Charity. May I know what job role Tafara desires the most, please?
393 - 20 Dec 2023 12:42PM - +263 77 298 9303: 1.Geologist 2. Geographical information Surveyor (GIS) 3. Ecologist In that order
394 - 20 Dec 2023 12:57PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. A person with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Geography can pursue a career as both a Geologist and a Geographical Information Surveyor (GIS). A Geologist studies the Earth's structure, composition, and processes, including examining rocks, minerals, and natural resources. The knowledge gained from a geography degree, especially in physical geography, can provide a strong foundation for understanding geological concepts.
395 - 20 Dec 2023 12:57PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: On the other hand, a Geographical Information Surveyor (GIS) specializes in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting spatial data using geographic information systems. A BA in Geography equips individuals with the spatial and analytical skills necessary for GIS work. The interdisciplinary nature of geography allows for a seamless transition into GIS, where professionals use mapping technology to visualize and interpret geographic data.
396 - 20 Dec 2023 12:57PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: In summary, a BA in Geography offers a diverse skill set that can be applied to various fields, including geology and GIS, providing individuals with the flexibility to pursue careers in both disciplines.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

185 - 20 Dec 2023 01:09PM - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
186 - 20 Dec 2023 01:10PM - +263 77 335 8337: Afternoon...I currently don't have any knowledge about the cost of education in India
187 - 20 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
188 - 20 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
189 - 20 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

195 - 20 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.
196 - 20 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

420 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: Please Like I shared with you the Enrollment phases, let me reiterate  the same, The enrollment fees will be paid to reserve your scholarship seat
422 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
423 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
424 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
425 - 20 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
426 - 20 Dec 2023 11:31AM - +263 78 218 5787: Ok sir clearly understood
427 - 20 Dec 2023 12:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: So please are there any other questions you would like to ask?

430 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
431 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:  *Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.
432 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.
433 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.
434 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

435 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.
436 - 20 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

Growing in the Midlands Province of Zimbabwe were my parents were working as civil servants.Attended Primary education there in Midlance Province.Attained good results at Primary  level.My parents got a place for me again at a boarding school in Midlance province where I did form 1 and 2.Also  I passed with good results and as a reward to such performance, my parents transferred me to a better school in Harare for my form 3 and form 4. At a new school again I performed very well and was one of best students at school me. I set for my final examinations at the end of year and Iam waiting for my results.  Apart from schooling,I grow up in urban areas , interacting with friends in urban schools.I was made to grow in Christian Life where we respect every person since we believe that a human being was fearfully and wonderfully made by the Most High God in heaven.This taught me not to bully other children at school and anywhere else.Also I learnt that we need to do charity works so that we help those in need.We do not have just to receive good things from others but us also have to do also. Being a first born in a family of 4 kids and only girl, l learn to be responsible at tender age since I had to help my mother to take care of my siblings since Mom could not do it alone.I can now do my chores without anneccesaryly asking for help. Afternoon writing my final examinations ,whilst waiting for my results ,to avoid being  a school dropout,Iam doing driving lessons such that I upgrade my status as a lady.I have to equip myself to face the challenges of life. Now I pray that if I be given a scholarship since my parents are striving to pay fees for my sibling,I will utilise that chance to attain good results so that I will help my parents to take care of my siblings as well as other vulnerable kids in my society.It is my humble prayer that I be considered.

Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.
295 - 20 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.
296 - 20 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.
297 - 20 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings.

232 - 20 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
233 - 20 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

30 - 20 Dec 2023 12:56PM - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I am a lively caring young woman. Im an avid reader of novels and I enjoy drawing, singing and writing. I come from a family of six and I'm the eldest child. I have three siblings, two sisters and one brother. They are all still in school .My  mother is a teacher in Kwekwe and my dad is a miner and they  reached Advanced level in their schooling and also in further studies, they will be supporting me. My family especially my parents have been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me, to dream and work hard in life knowing that the sky is the limit. My parents have been financing my studies since first grade up to Advanced level in high school. I completed my Advanced level at Thornhill in Midlands province this year ,2023, were I was the Headgirl, public speaking and debate president and a member of the science club.  I'm currently waiting for my  Advanced level results. The school fees  was about  90 USD and RTGS depending on bank rate.l aspire to pursue a career in the health sector, particularly pharmacy. This is a sector that is a good investment and that would be needed by people for a lifetime. I desire to open my own pharmacies in my country to create employment and ensure community around are well served. <This message was edited>
31 - 20 Dec 2023 01:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth? <This message was edited>
32 - 20 Dec 2023 01:22PM - +263 78 235 7517: For grade one to grade 7 I attended Cecil John Rhodes school, in Midlands province. It was the building block for my life because I was elected as headgirl at seventh grade, this made me more responsible and self aware of my abilities to lead and work well with others.When we wrote Gweru District exams for grade seven, I was topper in my class, this awakened a hunger for studies which I have carried till now. For high school I was at Thornhill high school from form 1 to form 6. In form 1 I was in the schools girls soccer team and I learnt how to coordinate with others, in body language and verbal communication. Then for my fifth and sixth form my chemistry teacher, elected me to be the class rep, were I was the one responsible for organizing  experiments for chemistry, ensuring we had all the chemicals needed and that everyone else was fully prepared for the practical. For me that experience made me more responsible and conscious about the needs for others because if there were absence or depletion of certain chemicals in the experiment, I would report to my teacher and the lab technicians. In  my sixth form which was my final year, I was elected to be the Headgirl, which was an honor and a great responsibility. I learnt that being a leader is not always about dictating your own views but communicating with others well and representing and serving them well. It wasn't easy having to be strict and tough but it taught me the necessary skills of leading and helped me grow into a responsible, caring person. Being a member of science club for my fifth and sixth year taught me to be creative in the most unimaginable ways for example when we created a board cleaner using wash soap, vinegar and water. It was heart warming when the lab technicians encouraged us to always be creative. <This message was edited>

34 - 20 Dec 2023 01:27PM - +263 78 235 7517: Initially I wanted to go for medicine but the sight of blood gave me chills down my spine, thats when I decided to go for pharmacy, I get to help people but without having to view them. It allows me to communicate with people about their health and another advantage is that, I can start as an employee and after some time of experience and gain of knowledge, I can have my own pharmacy and create employment for others

44 - 20 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

43 - 20 Dec 2023 02:46PM - +263 78 235 7517: Thank you for the information
44 - 20 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
45 - 20 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
46 - 20 Dec 2023 03:13PM - +263 78 235 7517: Yes I am confident
47 - 20 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: So @263782357517 , Earlier you shared with me that you are aware of the fact that the Edoofa Program Recommends India as a higher education destination for higher education, So I am sure your friend Kelvin must have briefed you about the same?
48 - 20 Dec 2023 03:39PM - +263 78 235 7517: Yes he did
49 - 20 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Shubham Madhwal: So please share your understanding of the same with me!
50 - 20 Dec 2023 03:52PM - +263 78 235 7517: The Edoofa program helps students like myself from Africa to pursue higher tertiary studies in India
51 - 20 Dec 2023 03:52PM - +263 78 235 7517: Thats what I had understood from the word go
60 - 20 Dec 2023 04:00PM - +263 78 235 7517: Wow India is country to consider for sure
61 - 20 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Natalie, as you are now aware, the reason why we recommend India as a higher education destination for your higher education, So I am sure your friend Kelvin must have also briefed you about the cost of Education here in India after you were aware of the Edoofa scholarship and also about the Earn While You Learn Program.  Can you comment about them in 100-200 words, So that I can get your understanding about the same and assist you accordingly?
62 - 20 Dec 2023 04:24PM - +263 78 235 7517: The Edoofa scholarship is partially funded and funds about 50 to 80 percent of tuition fee. Studying in India without a scholarship costs about $7000 to $8000 but when you get Edoofa scholarship it's about $2000 to $3000. What I understood about the Earn while you learn program is that you can get an internship that allows you to work and study at the same time. You also get scholarship credits while you are on an earn while you learn program
63 - 20 Dec 2023 04:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, And I really appreciate and admire your enthusiasm for the same. My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
64 - 20 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +263 78 235 7517: So what kind of projects and assignments embark on
65 - 20 Dec 2023 04:50PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.
66 - 20 Dec 2023 04:50PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
67 - 20 Dec 2023 04:50PM - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
68 - 20 Dec 2023 04:51PM - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
69 - 20 Dec 2023 04:51PM - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
111 - 20 Dec 2023 05:43PM - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
112 - 20 Dec 2023 05:43PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026). *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
113 - 20 Dec 2023 05:49PM - +263 78 235 7517: Sure thank you
114 - 20 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
115 - 20 Dec 2023 06:01PM - +263 78 235 7517: My parents
116 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
117 - 20 Dec 2023 06:32PM - +263 78 235 7517: Really thats a lot
118 - 20 Dec 2023 06:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
119 - 20 Dec 2023 06:36PM - +263 78 235 7517: That is a financial relief
120 - 20 Dec 2023 06:37PM - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:  1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc  2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month.  3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
133 - 20 Dec 2023 06:47PM - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).  Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
134 - 20 Dec 2023 06:49PM - +263 78 235 7517: Noted
135 - 20 Dec 2023 06:50PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down  1.      Edoofa's vision and benefits if you're eligible?   2.      Cost of Education in India and the course which you're applying for and Why do we recommend India for higher education?   3.

137 - 20 Dec 2023 07:18PM - +263 78 235 7517: 1.Edoofas vision is that students get real time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting an opportunity to earn scholarship credits and provide a promising future for its students and benefits when I'm eligible are EWYL programs I can partake in to boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs and tactics 2.cost of education in India with Edoofa is $2000 to $3000  and in pharmacy India is recommended because one out of the  top 10 growing pharma companies 3 Enrollment fee payment is $350 in 7 days. If one faces any challenges in paying, a payment plan is made and they pay $200 within 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days
138 - 20 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
139 - 20 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education. In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
140 - 20 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
141 - 20 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
142 - 20 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*",No,No,N,,

412 - 20 Dec 2023 01:33PM - +263 77 406 6067: Not very clear it's our first time
413 - 20 Dec 2023 02:37PM - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
414 - 20 Dec 2023 02:50PM - +263 77 344 3262: Mode 2 sir
415 - 20 Dec 2023 03:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
416 - 20 Dec 2023 03:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe   The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

106 - 20 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
107 - 20 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

123 - 20 Dec 2023 12:53PM - +260 97 1819712: Thank you for the helpful information Sir.I'm so impressed and motivated about India's achievements through out it's course of history,it shows that the country all along had the vision of spreading academics and skill building across the country and globe at large.Hence It brings clarity to my mind why India is recommended as a higher education destination. I'm inspired once more.
124 - 20 Dec 2023 01:09PM - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.  Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
125 - 20 Dec 2023 02:16PM - +260 97 1819712: The reason I want to study Abroad and not in my country is because Abroad there is a provision of profound quality education,high odds of job employment and a privilege of experiencing a whole new culture. Studying abroad will    offere me an opportunity to experience practical skills. Studying abroad will help in taking care of financial issues depending on extracurricular And academic records.

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
125 - 20 Dec 2023 02:16PM - +260 97 1819712: The reason I want to study Abroad and not in my country is because Abroad there is a provision of profound quality education,high odds of job employment and a privilege of experiencing a whole new culture. Studying abroad will    offere me an opportunity to experience practical skills. Studying abroad will help in taking care of financial issues depending on extracurricular And academic records.

130 - 20 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.

131 - 20 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
132 - 20 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
156 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - +260 97 1819712: The EWYL program seems to be a Helpful platform, At the look of it I think it's not only helping students  achieve there dreams but also providing other alternatives to grow there Career .I believe this provision coming from EWYL program  is overrated and it will be beneficial indeed.

336 - 20 Dec 2023 03:49PM - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.

338 - 20 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
339 - 20 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
340 - 20 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
341 - 20 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
342 - 20 Dec 2023 04:56PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*",No,No,N,,

117 - 20 Dec 2023 10:42AM - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well  As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
118 - 20 Dec 2023 11:29AM - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we can start
119 - 20 Dec 2023 12:11PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
120 - 20 Dec 2023 12:13PM - +263 78 440 8694: Not yet I have not really done any thorough research nor have I yet applied to any university abroad
121 - 20 Dec 2023 12:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
122 - 20 Dec 2023 12:42PM - +263 78 440 8694: No I do not have any knowledge at all
123 - 20 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.

This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
125 - 20 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

128 - 20 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
129 - 20 Dec 2023 01:51PM - +263 78 440 8694: Wow this is actually great and it lifts a heavy burden on both the parents and the students

132 - 20 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.

136 - 20 Dec 2023 05:54PM - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

148 - 20 Dec 2023 05:54PM - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
149 - 20 Dec 2023 06:00PM - +263 78 440 8694: It definitely will benefit me so much. Being exposed to the industry whilst I'm still learning makes me 10 times better than my mates and the experience I get while working at the same time studying gives me a platform to learn how to balance my things . At the end of the day after I've graduated I believe that I definitely will not be in the same level with the people I might have attended classes with and done the programme with hence this working while learning program is an added advantage to the student, elevating them to an even higher level

257 - 20 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Tushti: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:  *Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.  *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.  *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.  *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.  *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.  In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
206 - 20 Dec 2023 04:46PM - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth. Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles ‚Äì so much for rent, for food, for the children‚Äôs shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can‚Äôt really afford . As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.  1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage a)The cause of poverty is extravagance. b)Stingy habits of the poor. c)Being extravagant is always condemnable. d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.  2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time. b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle. c)Must be extravagant before achieving success. d)Should not bother about popularity.  3. The phrase ‚Äòlavish with his hospitality‚Äô in the third sentence of the first paragraph means a)Extravagance in entertaining guest. b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives. c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers. d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.  4.The word ‚Äòparadox‚Äô in the last sentence of the first paragraph means a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning b)Statement based on facts c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth. d)Statement based on the popular opinion  5.What is the meaning of the word ‚Äúequanimity‚Äù? a)Calmness b)Discomposure c)Equivocal d)Dubious  *_SECTION 3_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* *_Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole._* *_After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is._*  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.
