However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent. *Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

163 - 09 Dec 2023 10:59AM - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
164 - 09 Dec 2023 10:59AM - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

137 - 09 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

46 - 09 Dec 2023 11:29AM - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship.  I hope you are confident about him achieving it.

50 - 09 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Arshita: I understand ! Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability. We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad. Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

162 - 09 Dec 2023 11:55AM - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

164 - 09 Dec 2023 11:58AM - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent. *Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

306 - 08 Dec 2023 03:45PM - Austin: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about your child achieving it.

203 - 09 Dec 2023 01:47PM - Austin: The remaining fee depends on the scholarship percentage and earnings of the child through the Earn While You Learn program. For example, the annual cost of education for Japhet ranges $1900 after scholarship and he manages to earn $70 per annum through the Earn While you Learn Program resulting in $840 per annum, then the difference would be $1900-$840= $1060 which can be paid in two equal installments, each installment before a semester. There are two semesters in a year

20 - 09 Dec 2023 12:50PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
21 - 09 Dec 2023 12:50PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22 - 09 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

It was a state planed genocide and Hutu majority were encouraged to attack there Tutsi neighbors with guns matches and sticks.The search for Tutsi minority was  house to house search and road blocks. The people were murdered and they used sexual violence as a weapon of war where Hutu men and militant sexually assaulted tutsi women. Furthermore, about 75% of the Tutsi minority population were killed.Consquently, women and children suffered a lot  women were left as widows and most of them were raped and remained very traumatized while children became orphans and they had to fend for themselves. The genocide also caused displacement were about two million people became refugees in neigbouring countries.Muchmore the whole family system as well as the general social fabric that formally provided support to it's members was destroyed due to massive deaths.There was great mistrust and fear.Most survivors were females, hence  households were women headed as well as child headed homes.As a result, these homes were suffering from economic deprivation evidently shown by lack of basic needs such as food shelter housing healthy clean water as well as there children lacking education. The primary target for the genocide were men and boys. The genocidal crimes were mainly committed by men and  a gender imbalance was therefore assumed in parenting.The families of genocide survivors were exposed to more traumatic events and they were affected interns of both physical and mental health as well as social and economical factors.

152 - 08 Dec 2023 02:37PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Cleopatra, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

119 - 09 Dec 2023 11:19AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?

122 - 09 Dec 2023 11:43AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*

123 - 09 Dec 2023 11:43AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
175 - 08 Dec 2023 04:15PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

176 - 09 Dec 2023 10:20AM - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone, Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.  Let us continue the session.
177 - 09 Dec 2023 10:55AM - +263 78 204 3608: Good morning
178 - 09 Dec 2023 11:02AM - +263 77 350 7141: Morning
179 - 09 Dec 2023 11:31AM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
180 - 09 Dec 2023 11:31AM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
181 - 09 Dec 2023 11:31AM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

224 - 09 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
225 - 09 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

57 - 09 Dec 2023 11:51AM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
58 - 09 Dec 2023 11:51AM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27 - 08 Dec 2023 02:06PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

171 - 09 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
172 - 09 Dec 2023 11:34AM - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21 - 09 Dec 2023 11:18AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22 - 09 Dec 2023 11:18AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

24 - 09 Dec 2023 11:18AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25 - 09 Dec 2023 11:22AM - +263 78 823 4502: Yes understood
26 - 09 Dec 2023 11:41AM - Gurvinder: That is great.
27 - 09 Dec 2023 11:41AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nigel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
28 - 09 Dec 2023 11:42AM - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
29 - 09 Dec 2023 11:42AM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30 - 09 Dec 2023 01:15PM - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

69 - 09 Dec 2023 12:23PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
70 - 09 Dec 2023 12:23PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

221 - 08 Dec 2023 03:37PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?

229 - 09 Dec 2023 11:07AM - Gurvinder: Samathar, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.",No,No

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
41 - 08 Dec 2023 04:23PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

83 - 09 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 77 261 0463: It  could be a result of poor career guidance, our research had shown that chemistry and biology are the key subjects.  Also since he had a grade C in Physics he could not pursue it at A level due to school policy that does not allow a learner to pursue a subject with a C
84 - 09 Dec 2023 03:10PM - Harmehak: I do understand please.
85 - 09 Dec 2023 03:10PM - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
86 - 09 Dec 2023 03:10PM - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*  2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*  3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*  4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*  5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*  6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*  7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

313 - 09 Dec 2023 02:44PM - +263 78 038 1173: SECTION 5 It is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient to a greater extent. The writer seeks to evaluate that mamny Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.  Firstly, the writer insist that the majority if not the minority of African countries use outdated machinery. A typical example that may fully explain the use of outdated machinery is the use of ox-drawn ploughs in a country like Zimbabwe. The use of these ox-drawn ploughs has resulted in productive and allocative inefficiency. On the same note the writer insist that most  African people fail to enjoy a balanced diet due to the issue of poverty  In addition to that, most African countries are affected by the problem of inflation. Inflation refers to a persistent increase in the price of general goods and services. This may lead to low purchasing power of the country's currency leading to high cost of purchasing inputs for agricultural purposes  Furthermore, most African countries are affected by political instability. This is a major cause of wastage of resources in the sense that people will invest in arms and ammunition instead of investing in Agriculture which may be the source of the balanced diet.  However, the writer may argue that some African countries may be able to afford good diets through the implementation of national agricultural projects such as command agriculture in Zimbabwe were farmers are given inputs and machinery to cultivate their farms  In conclusion, the writer argues that the majority of the African countries have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.

Presenting my strengths,iam good at leadership traits as i was once a school headboy during my academic  course which i finished on 13 November 2023.However I have some weaknesses also,some of them includes low self esteem sometimes. As a boy who loves associating with others,I spent my time training my community choir as iam good at singing and conducting choir. Explaining my family background,I come from a certain growth point in Zimbabwe thus making us low income earners as sometimes we struggle in terms of financial issues .                                                         .                                                                     Referring to my current educational levels starting with O'level, i have 5 O'level subjects and iam waiting for A' level results release in January 2024.With reference to my A'level combination,i would like to study Business management. The reason why i chose this course is that because this had been my dream since primary level,and I'm much interested in innovating business ideas and proudly in need to be a business man in future.My subject combination included,Accounting,Economics and Business studies.In explanation to my my parent's professions starting with my mother,she is a college clerk whilst my father is a driver.                                                       .                                                                     Referring to my family again,I have two siblings which makes me the older one.My two little brothers are in primary levels now meaning they don't have any occupation for now. Till I finished my A'level academic course,my parents were the ones who were financially supporting me throughout and I hope they will be the ones who will support my higher education abroad.My per-term school fees was $70,00.

146 - 09 Dec 2023 11:54AM - +263 77 585 5103: This is the first time so I  am anxious  about it  but since you mentioned that there would be a caretaker I am actually okay with that
147 - 09 Dec 2023 11:55AM - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
148 - 09 Dec 2023 11:55AM - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) Application Form  2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
149 - 09 Dec 2023 11:58AM - +263 77 585 5103: Yeah I  believe that is it and also information about the university
150 - 09 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Kunal: Indeed *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
151 - 09 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.  So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
152 - 09 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Kunal: <Media omitted>

161 - 09 Dec 2023 02:49PM - Kunal: Well, We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.  Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
162 - 09 Dec 2023 02:55PM - +263 77 585 5103: Ok proceed
163 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
164 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

I'm well-informed about the challenges faced by the youth in Zimbabwe, particularly the struggle to secure appropriate employment despite holding higher degrees. In contrast, our program in India ensures comprehensive education and training for multinational corporations, offering a pathway to guaranteed employment, which can significantly benefit the youth in Zimbabwe.

85 - 09 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the results, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

325 - 08 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Sahil Edoofa: Michelle's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  *1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  *2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  *3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

290 - 09 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
291 - 09 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
292 - 09 Dec 2023 03:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.",No,No

I'm particularly interested in public health, which gives me the opportunity to address the social and environmental factors that influence health, and find ways to improve the health of entire communities. This is a meaningful and fulfilling career path that aligns with my values and interests, and I'm excited to explore
120 - 09 Dec 2023 10:11AM - +263 78 135 9201: As a public health professional, I want to use my skills and knowledge to advocate for policies and programs that will make a real difference in people's lives. I want to use my understanding of the social determinants of health to address systemic inequalities and ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare. I'm also interested in using data and research to inform my work and make evidence-based decisions. Ultimately, I want to make a positive impact on the health of communities, and improve the quality of life for individuals and families.

122 - 09 Dec 2023 10:26AM - +263 78 135 9201: Sure! I'm more interested in sociology as it is aligned with the vision and goal that I have for the people. I had this passion for a very long time. So I got to enhance it by volunteering as an individual at different children's homes and as a former member of the Leo Club I got to experience much more. During our last session,I have mentioned about how I contributed to the initiative to end child marriages and I still intend to do so. Hence, sociology can be the best program as I will learn more about the societies and how they live. This is area has always been inside of me so I can safely say it's a calling so that I can be an individual that will positively make an impact in people's lives regardless of their age,gender,race or background.
123 - 09 Dec 2023 10:29AM - +263 78 135 9201: I have also observed that whenever I hear about problems not only in the world but in my society at time I could get frustrated and ask myself,""what can I really do to bring a change and how I'm going to do it"". I believe that my purpose is to serve the people and I can do that by making an impact through speaking up,making some changes,have the chance to research and solve problems depending on the society or nation

93 - 09 Dec 2023 11:28AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
94 - 09 Dec 2023 11:30AM - +263 71 947 4887: Instead of physics I did Maths
95 - 09 Dec 2023 11:32AM - +263 71 947 4887: That's what it is here in Zimbabwe for example at University of Zimbabwe they require math biology and chemistry so that you qualify in studying medicine there that's why I did no do physics
96 - 09 Dec 2023 11:34AM - +263 71 947 4887: So what happens if u don't have physics at A level
97 - 09 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Laiza.

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
211 - 08 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
212 - 08 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?

The education system's emphasis on holistic learning and the pursuit of knowledge has produced accomplished individuals who excel in various fields across the world. India's remarkable cultural diversity, with its multitude of languages, traditions, art forms, and cuisines, fosters a rich tapestry of human experiences that inspire unity in diversity. Together, these aspects represent India's invaluable contributions to global education and cultural enrichment, fostering understanding and harmony among people of all backgrounds!
87 - 09 Dec 2023 11:32AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's accountancy standards have gained international recognition for their precision, transparency, and adherence to global best practices.

164 - 09 Dec 2023 03:21PM - +263 77 329 4459: True
165 - 09 Dec 2023 03:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
166 - 09 Dec 2023 03:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

258 - 09 Dec 2023 10:12AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

260 - 09 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.  Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation",No,No

This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
291 - 09 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
292 - 09 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

192 - 09 Dec 2023 10:31AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
193 - 09 Dec 2023 10:32AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

155 - 09 Dec 2023 10:09AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
156 - 09 Dec 2023 10:09AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
157 - 09 Dec 2023 10:09AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
158 - 09 Dec 2023 10:19AM - +263 77 857 3350: All the points are equally valuable and incomparable but for the sake of your question number 4 is appreciated most because it's always good to be guided from the beginning to the end.
159 - 09 Dec 2023 10:35AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Courage! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!

Moreover, as I have mentioned before, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that she will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents!

According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

128 - 09 Dec 2023 12:44PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
140 - 09 Dec 2023 01:18PM - +263 77 441 5087: In my native country after attaining education it's hard to get a job so that's why I'm opting studying abroad
141 - 09 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?

57 - 09 Dec 2023 01:48PM - +263 78 291 7701: As I already highlighted I was studying at Lower Gwelo Adventist High school. It is an seventh day Adventist church institution , a mission church sited in Gweru Midlands province  The school is an internationally accredited school with an A as of this year ..it provides high quality education. It also enhanced my physical growth as we used to work in fields with regular work programs , this helped me to learn to farm, woodwork , clean and much more . We also had a gym at school where we kept our physical bodies healthy  It also touched the spiritual aspect because we had morning prayers everyday and regular meetings in church to learn about God and how to mold our characters to be good students qualified for heaven. I participated in church programs and was appointed a pathfinder counselor.  Mentally I participated in quiz activities ...Aids quiz we reached district level as a team and this aided in sharpening my mind ...I also participated in bible quiz at church.. we also went for school quiz and I represented my school as best in chemistry till district level .. I am also a chess Wizard with an unbeaten streak record at this school  I was part of three clubs at the schools namely Young farmer's club Wich we learnt of new ways of crop cultivation and animal husbandry and First aid club Wich taught me much about caring for others and procedures when someone is injured And finally with computer club we spread computer literacy in surrounding schools  And most importantly I was the school senior prefect Wich taught me how to enforce the rules and I made very good lasting relationship with many teachers at this school   I am very proud to say I had the best high school experience at this schools and enhanced my growth , physically, mentally, morally and spiritually

59 - 09 Dec 2023 02:15PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!  I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Medical science, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
60 - 09 Dec 2023 02:28PM - +263 78 291 7701: Well since childhood I grew up at a health institution from one General hospital to the other .... So I grew up idolizing doctors and health personals wanting to be like them when I grow up ...and now I'm grown I've realized that my dream has become my passion.... I love helping others and I feel like it's my calling... At school I was the captain of the First aid club ... At school I love chemistry thats my favorite subject thus people encouraged me to do medical sciences Whenever someone fell sick at school they came to me for medication and I ended up with a nickname Dr chiks ... surrounding influences always say you will be a great doctor ...and since I personally love that job the words are  motivation to me  I want to help in someone's recovery ...I do my best to make sure someone is well ...maybe it all started when I was young when I faced the trauma when my cousin brother had a seizure and I cried feeling helpless and couldn't do anything..he was later saved by a doctor..thus I devoted my work to saving lives  The subject I do at A level if I pass will lead me to my future path of being a doctor.

96 - 09 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

229 - 09 Dec 2023 03:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
230 - 09 Dec 2023 03:20PM - +260 97 2413156: Yess you did
231 - 09 Dec 2023 03:59PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
232 - 09 Dec 2023 04:14PM - +260 97 2413156: So if I get the EDOOFA schoolarship I'll only be required to pay $350 only
233 - 09 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me help you understand better for your clarity!
234 - 09 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:  1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc  2.

127 - 09 Dec 2023 12:44PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Yes please
128 - 09 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
129 - 09 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
130 - 09 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
131 - 09 Dec 2023 01:31PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Well noted
132 - 09 Dec 2023 01:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

144 - 09 Dec 2023 01:36PM - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
145 - 09 Dec 2023 02:08PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Yes I do think it will benefit me too

192 - 09 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
193 - 09 Dec 2023 04:25PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Definitely...I have been looking for this... And the good thing there is that I can be able to reduce my financial burden to pay for my educational costs at the same time gaining knowledge from the EWYL.

221 - 09 Dec 2023 05:38PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Yes you did mention that

Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
227 - 09 Dec 2023 06:20PM - +265 880 77 04 44: Wow that's incredible
228 - 09 Dec 2023 06:21PM - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:  1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same?

Please type your answers in the group directly.  2. For MCQ Questions you can directly type the options  3. If you have any doubts regarding the test or any information, you can ask without hesitation. --------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 1:- PERSONAL INFORMATION  Name as per School Record- Gender- Date of Birth as per School Record- Father's Name- Mother's Name- Email Address- Parent's email address- Course: Intake Year: Country :   SECTION 2 READING TEST  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision.

Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has been a period of rebuilding and reconciliation. The country has made significant progress in many areas, including economic development, infrastructure, and education. However, there are still challenges facing the country, such as poverty, disease, and ethnic tensions. Rwanda's economic development: Since the genocide, Rwanda's economy has grown rapidly. GDP has increased by over 6% annually, and per capita income has more than doubled. The country has also made significant investments in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power plants. This has made it easier for businesses to operate and has attracted foreign investment. The Rwandan government has also made significant progress in education and healthcare. The primary school enrollment rate has increased from 64% in 2001 to over 90% today. This has helped to reduce illiteracy rates and increase the number of skilled workers in the country. The government has also built new hospitals and clinics, and made improvements to existing facilities. This has led to a decrease in infant mortality and an increase in life expectancy. The challenges: Despite the progress that has been made, Rwanda still faces a number of challenges. The country is still one of the poorest in the world, and poverty. Overall, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has been a time of rebuilding and recovery. The country has made significant progress in many areas, including economic development, infrastructure, and education. However, there are still challenges facing the country, including poverty, disease, and ethnic tensions. The future of Rwanda depends on the government's ability to address these challenges and continue to improve the lives of its   SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST ""My Inspirational Story""  *The examiner will use your composition to analyze your personality traits. USE AT LEAST 400 WORDS.* My inspirational story is the one of Margaret Hamilton. Margaret Hamilton was a computer scientist and systems engineer who played a pivotal role in the development of software for the Apollo space program. She was born on August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, and grew up with a strong interest in mathematics and science. In 1958, she earned a degree in mathematics from Earlham College and later went on to pursue graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Michigan. In the early 1960s, Hamilton began working as a computer programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She was soon recruited to work on the Apollo program, where she was responsible for developing the onboard flight software for the Apollo spacecraft. Her work was crucial to the success of the Apollo missions, including the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. Hamilton's contributions to the Apollo program were groundbreaking in many ways. She was one of the first programmers to use an object-oriented programming language, which allowed her to create software that was more flexible and adaptable than previous programs. She was also responsible for developing software that could detect and correct errors in real-time, which was essential for the safety of the astronauts onboard the spacecraft. After the Apollo program, Hamilton continued to work at MIT and later founded her own software company, Hamilton Technologies. She also became an advocate for greater diversity in the field of computer science, particularly for women and underrepresented minorities. In recognition of her contributions to the field, Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Overall, Margaret Hamilton's life story is one of determination, innovation, and groundbreaking achievement. She played a crucial role in the development of software for the Apollo program and helped to pave the way for future generations of computer scientists and engineers. My goal and aim in life is to be come successful like her through all challenges that may come what way.",No,No

B) 2  SECTION 5  I think it is safe to say the trauma of a genocide stays with the affected population for a long, long time, and I also agree  that 16 years after the genocide, the Rwandan society and Rwanda have changed so much. In Today’s Rwanda, there is no room for segregation and divisionism. There is absolutely zero tolerance with regards to genocide ideology, Rwanda has achieved more than many people envisioned in the past 16 years From having the cleanest capital city in Africa, to being one of the least corrupted countries in Africa, being one of the most well-organized government in Africa, a champion of gender equality and a paradise for women, and many more.Rwanda has gone from being a “ failed state” to what many have called an “ economic miracle”.It has not been a smooth ride, but despite the challenges, Rwanda has continued to push through, overcoming danger and adversity along the way. 16 years after genocide, Rwanda is a peaceful, developing country, with the ambition to change the course of its history for the better. According to the World Economic Forum, Rwanda is among the top 20 safest nations in the world.The key reason for Rwandan success ( after 1994 genocide) is attributed to promoting gender equality. Giving men and women equal opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge. Women have not only embraced the opportunities, they have taken it to another level in all sectors of the economy in both private and public sector.Rwandans are the most dedicated and most resilient people. They love their country, and they are determined to work hard together to build a peaceful and prosperous economy.Rwanda has made significant progress in recent years in areas such as education, healthcare, and technology, which can provide opportunities for foreign professionals and entrepreneurs. Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy.  SECTION 6 ""My Inspirational story""  piration: Higher Education and South Western Community This is my first time posting my essay on here but i need help please. I have never written a narrative essay so i need to know if this is what it is supposed to look like?  My Inspiration  My father taught me lots of lessons in life since I was young, but the one that stood above them all was the subject of education. He always told me that if I wanted to be successful, I would have to go to university and make something out of myself. My family is not a wealthy family. Therefore, my dad saved every single penny he earned from work to buy anything that I needed. He always encouraged me, because he knew that the value of an education will determine a future for me. As a result, I admired him. My dad had a huge impact on how I am today. He has influenced my life by teaching me lessons and showing me the rights and wrongs. My dad taught me the most important lesson: how to be an independent male. I still remember the day that my father sat next to me and said, ""Hey buddy"", the most important thing to help you become successful is to have an education, it won’t be a walk in the park dude, but in the end it will be more then worth it. Of course, I already knew he was going to say that, for it was nothing new.  My father was a very smart man. He did not finish high school for he had my brother and had to drop out to work. He then had my sister and eight years later my mother and my father had me! My sister only accomplished one year of  high as for my brother, the straight A student, finished with our dad’s support and became an electrician. My dad always reminded me of how my sister and my brother’s life style were different. He thought (and might be right) that they have different life styles because my brother had a higher education was now satisfied and happy; unlike my sister whom wasn't ’t as happy and satisfied with her. The reflected appraisal that he made clear to me before he passed away, almost 7 years ago, was that I needed to further my education and finally do something with my life. he always told me that I was a lot smarter than I let people see. My father didn't let an opportunity pass to teach his children. My dad has taught me lots of things there is to know about many different subjects. Because of him I have learned to change tires on a car, because of him I have learned how to respect my siblings, because of him I have learned to cherish the moments in everyday life, because of him I have learned to have more confidence in myself. He was really a role model. Rest easy, man.

44 - 09 Dec 2023 12:26PM - +260 770182875: While at Njase which is currently my previous school I learned how to live my life  without parental guidance and actually drive my self to make decisions that are to my benefits and also to uphold  my parents reputation.By  it's nature Njase is a mission school and so every    pupil is to know how important God is in their life  and while there I learned to fear God as the moto of the school states that the fare of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom .the school offers help to pupils  in  all possible angle  therefore teaching us the pupils how to love and share the little we have .The teachers or rather the school administration was not my only source of wisdom but my friends were also a part of building me to what I am today.while at Njase I participated not only in academic activities like literature quiz under LATAS competitions but I also did sports like handball and volleyball just to keep my self fit physically and mentally .Not only did I participate in this but I was also an active member of a club called Let Girls Learn  club which was a club that was focusing on educating girls.The club also taught me a lot as I am a girl too.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

105 - 09 Dec 2023 12:39PM - +263 71 226 7257: Because it is obsessed with education
106 - 09 Dec 2023 12:40PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
118 - 09 Dec 2023 01:06PM - +263 71 226 7257: I want to study abroad because l want to have access to quality education
119 - 09 Dec 2023 01:31PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?

121 - 09 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
122 - 09 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +263 71 226 7257: No l don't
123 - 09 Dec 2023 02:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program

133 - 09 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
134 - 09 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
220 - 09 Dec 2023 05:37PM - +263 71 226 7257: My parents,Mr and Mrs Marowa
221 - 09 Dec 2023 05:45PM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
222 - 09 Dec 2023 05:46PM - +263 71 226 7257: Yes you did
223 - 09 Dec 2023 05:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
224 - 09 Dec 2023 06:00PM - +263 71 226 7257: Ok l understand
225 - 09 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:  1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc  2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month.  3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
226 - 09 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

201 - 09 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
202 - 09 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
203 - 09 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

204 - 09 Dec 2023 12:15PM - +260 97 6182543: I see 👀, the EWYL program is absolutely unique aspect of Edoofa.
205 - 09 Dec 2023 12:16PM - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
276 - 09 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
277 - 09 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
278 - 09 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
279 - 09 Dec 2023 01:11PM - +260 97 6182543: *Noted*.
280 - 09 Dec 2023 01:12PM - +260 97 6182543: So the fees are they in US Dollars or?
281 - 09 Dec 2023 01:36PM - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please. Before we proceed ahead are there any questions you would like to ask?
282 - 09 Dec 2023 01:46PM - +260 97 6182543: If I was to qualify,do I  need to wait for *August* *2025* *intake* or I can still be picked in *August* *2024* *intake* ? <This message was edited>

286 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
287 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
288 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
289 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
290 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
291 - 09 Dec 2023 03:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
292 - 09 Dec 2023 03:33PM - +260 97 6182543: The most interesting thing,is the aspect of *affordability* *through* *guaranteed* *scholarship*. Most African students who desire to pursue their careers abroad find it difficult to afford all necessary requirements to fit into the international education system not just because they can not compete but due to financial challenges.In my case this aspect is totally amazing and worth given to deserving students from Africa and other marginalized regions across the world. <This message was edited>
293 - 09 Dec 2023 04:00PM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
294 - 09 Dec 2023 04:13PM - +260 97 6182543: I saw it in the previous texts you sent.
295 - 09 Dec 2023 04:17PM - +260 97 6182543: Yes, you did. <This message was edited>
296 - 09 Dec 2023 04:18PM - +260 97 6182543: Yes.
297 - 09 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
324 - 09 Dec 2023 05:10PM - +260 97 6182543: Okay.
325 - 09 Dec 2023 05:29PM - +260 97 6182543: The Edoofa's vision is to provide education that is *accessable*, *affordable* and *employable*.If you are eligible to this program you will enjoy various benefits such as assurance of *Expert* *Career* *Counseling* , *Affordability* *through* *guaranteed* *scholarships,Earn* *while* *you* *Learn* *initiative* , *Higher* *Education* *Concierge* who direct to select a right course, college or university, application form filling,visa and payment assistance, travel guidance and many more benefits.
326 - 09 Dec 2023 05:41PM - +260 97 6182543: The cost of education in India is between $6000- $8000 per year.The course which I am applying is *Medical* *Science*. India is recommended for higher education because of  many reasons. Among them are; Robust Education System, Renowned Institutions, Quality Education and Research, Faculty Expertise, Global Recognition and Career Prospects, Cultural Diversity and Vibrant Campus life, Affordability and Scholarships, English Medium of Instruction, Research and Innovation Opportunities and many other reasons.
327 - 09 Dec 2023 05:58PM - +260 97 6182543: Enrollment fee timeline currently has round 4 and 5.The first one (round 4), it's deadline is December 30,2023 while the latter is January 31,2024. The amount to be paid is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of my Edoofa Reservation Letter. The amount has to be paid once the student is found competent for the program after Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation. <This message was edited>
328 - 09 Dec 2023 05:58PM - +260 97 6182543: Sir I am done!
329 - 09 Dec 2023 06:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
330 - 09 Dec 2023 06:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education. In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
331 - 09 Dec 2023 06:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
332 - 09 Dec 2023 06:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
333 - 09 Dec 2023 06:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*",No,No

34 - 09 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
35 - 09 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
36 - 09 Dec 2023 12:13PM - +263 78 016 6548: Okay Sir

47 - 09 Dec 2023 01:05PM - +263 78 016 6548: My name is Tafadzwa Tsara and am 18 years old and  just finished writing my A'level exams in November .l would like to study International Law abroad .Both my father and mother are teachers.My father and mother have been supporting my Education so far and they will surely support me financially for higher education abroad. l have one sister who just graduated her final Honours Degree in Biotechnology this year in October and is now looking for a job.l studied at Marange UMC High school form 1-6 in Manicaland  .The fees is 420 us dollars per term

49 - 09 Dec 2023 01:47PM - +263 78 016 6548: l studied at Marange High School in Mutare ,Manicaland .So as l studied there l learnt that at times its not always about reading books and learn but caring and sharing is one of the essential things l discovered .l also learnt that of course we are different people but that does not stop us from helping , we should work hand in glove inorder to be successful in life. So as l was studying at Marange High School l became part and parcel of the Interact club as a Tail Twister, this club was  giving charity to underpriviledged children and those that did not have something to wear.This contributed to my holistic growth as it taught me to share the little that you have .l also participated in the Ray of Hope club which taught people to aim high have determination and be the best you could ever be .This inspired me that l could fit in some circumstances and maybe have a scholarship to continue my journey of success
50 - 09 Dec 2023 01:52PM - +263 78 016 6548: Studying at Marange High School provided a structured environment for learning and personal growth.

Participating in extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs, or community service also contributed to holistic growth by providing opportunities for leadership, teamwork, creativity, and personal interests outside of academics.  Conclusively  studying at Marange High School helped me a lot to become more well-rounded and prepared for the challenges of adulthood.
