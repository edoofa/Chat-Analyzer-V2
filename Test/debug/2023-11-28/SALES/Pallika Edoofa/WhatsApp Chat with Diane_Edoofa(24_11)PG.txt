24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, Please elaborate on this for me as I am unable to understand!!
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright, what am saying is all the photos that you've sent me are all white people. The black people aren't they successful after schooling at Edoofa
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, India has a rich history and has produced numerous influential individuals who have made significant contributions on the global stage. While the term "Black people" typically refers to individuals of African descent, India's diaspora has extended to various parts of the world, with Indian leaders making an impact globally.

24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As mentioned above, we have a community of more than 4,000 Edoofians that cam from Africa and doing wonders her in India and self financing their own higher education by earning the scholarship credits by doing Hard work
24/11/23, 4:07 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Still doesn't answer my question!! Why not put them up on the poster to show the world how successful they've become . Why the light skinned?
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, If you observe the poster titles, they are of Indian origins, which means, people who were born in India. The migration to India started a few years ago and it has only been a few years since African learners realized the value of the Indian Education System and have been utilizing the opportunity to secure the best exposure. Securing a citizenship in India, would take a long time and this is the reason we are yet to have them on the posters of India origin. But if you are looking at successful African learners who graduated from India, the best example would be the honourable First Lady of Zimbabwe who is the first African to secure a PhD from India. So you see, it is a treasure that has been discovered recently.
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You will have the success stories of African learners and they will be in the leading roles in the coming times.
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa Scholarship Program will be a catalyst for this change. I  believe you are looking for such an opportunity for your career.
24/11/23, 4:32 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Thank you very much this is what I wanted
24/11/23, 4:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're most welcome, Diane
24/11/23, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 4:34 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: No they are not
24/11/23, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

24/11/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Diane!!

 let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
24/11/23, 5:02 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Please enlighten me
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Diane, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/11/23, 5:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

24/11/23, 5:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
24/11/23, 5:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
24/11/23, 5:11 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Isn't it time consuming since you said that my course needs hard work and full attention?
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/11/23, 9:45 am - +265 883 86 01 04: Thank you I received it
27/11/23, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
27/11/23, 12:33 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Yes
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?

27/11/23, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great, Thank you for asking
27/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Glad to hear
27/11/23, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as there is an issue with my whatsapp today.
27/11/23, 1:26 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright alright
27/11/23, 1:26 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: No problem
27/11/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Diane, As per your previous query, Please note that, the commitment required for the course is indeed an investment. However, the time and effort put into it are directly tied to the practical projects we offer. These real-time, industry-relevant projects not only enhance technical skills but also foster communication, leadership, and team management abilities. Completing the course ensures our students are well-prepared with hands-on experience, making them highly employable internationally. It's a strategic investment in a rewarding future. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 1:33 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright, I think I can manage doing 2 things at once so yeah. I can benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program
27/11/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright alright
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Diane, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: I love them all🫶🏾😂
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: But 4, is the best
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: My sister I believe
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Yes I will definitely do that
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Can I ask?
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, You can
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know your query.
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Does edoofa do degree's or it's just Diploma
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Well they are quite excited since I will be very much educated and my brain will have more knowledge
27/11/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, Our program offers both Degree and diploma courses as you have been offered the degree course.
27/11/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Diane,I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 4:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
27/11/23, 4:45 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright
27/11/23, 4:46 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: So it is
27/11/23, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
27/11/23, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
27/11/23, 4:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Which is non-refundable??
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Wow!!!! That's alot plus the fees and all
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Now am starting to get worried
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Diane!!
27/11/23, 4:53 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: That is like 2.4M - 3.1M
27/11/23, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, Please note that it is a one time investment once you are found eligible for the program. Once you qualify and enroll, you'll kickstart the process of earning valuable scholarship credits. These credits, averaging around 50-100$ per month, provide a significant opportunity for you to independently finance your higher education before you embark on your journey to India. It's an investment that pays off in more ways than one.
27/11/23, 4:58 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Okay this is what I mean. My sister has to pay alot for me to be on a scholarship,
27/11/23, 4:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, when and why the enrollment fee is paid
27/11/23, 4:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
27/11/23, 4:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/11/23, 5:00 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright alright that's better
27/11/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
27/11/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 5:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 5:13 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: 1 &2 cause I feel like this was somehow an interview
27/11/23, 5:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Yeah sure
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - +265 883 86 01 04: Yes I am 100%
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
