I hope that you are doing well today.

15/11/23, 12:46 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Thank you, I'm alright, I hope you are well too.
15/11/23, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, I am, Thank you for the concern.
15/11/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chrissy, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Michelle ?*
15/11/23, 1:01 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Well my goal is to one day have a masters degree, but with the difficulties I have, paying fees is always an issue. So when I heard I can land myself a 100% Scholarship with Edoofa I was motivated to apply for the opportunity.
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Chrissy, Thank you for sharing this, However, Please note that the student will get a 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and once can achieve the higher quantum of the scholarship that 90-100% scholarship on tuition fees but the remaining cost after the scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, please let me add more information to it.
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.


*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Thank you for this information, but what if my family can't afford the remaining cost, what happens then?
15/11/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chrissy, I'd like to explain that the remaining expenses are feasible for families in your hometown. This presents a unique and valuable opportunity in your life, as seizing this chance not only opens the door to a higher level of scholarship but also allows you to work while studying. By participating, you can earn approximately 50-100 dollars' worth of scholarship credits each month, effectively reducing your tuition fees. As for the remaining fees, your family can start saving now, making it manageable for them to cover the expenses and ensure your participation in our program.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
20/11/23, 9:26 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Yes I'm willing to, if possible.
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!

21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chrissy, May I know the reason for your unavailability in the previous sessions?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: I was available I didn't see any messages sent
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chrissy, Please note that again the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship on tuition and Accommodation but the remaining cost after the scholarship and Transportation is catered by a student's family. I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
21/11/23, 1:28 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: So it's only the tuition that is covered? While traveling cost accomodation and food at  student's expense, I'm I getting this right?
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Chrissy, so, is your family willing to support you on those?
21/11/23, 1:44 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: 🥲 I don't think they will afford things are really hard right now.
21/11/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have you discussed about this with them?
21/11/23, 2:04 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: No but I know how things are right now here, it's really hard to even bring it up. Maybe try to break it down for me in figures so when you say 50% I know how much we are dealing with.
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding the same, Chrissy in the further sessions.
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Alright then

I am here to begin the session, 

Shall we begin the session?
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Yes sure
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?

22/11/23, 1:39 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Still discussing plus we have to know the figures before the final decision is made.
22/11/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chrissy, Have you gone through this briefly?
22/11/23, 3:15 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Yes I have gone through it
22/11/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please let me know your understanding?
22/11/23, 4:02 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: There is so much info but here are some of the things I can share according to my understanding.


Firstly that Edoofa is not a charity program, gives scholarship to deserving students, that's according to their merit, attitude.

That the overall tuition of a student in India is about 10,000$ per year but with Edoofa is comes down to 2000/ 3000$ per year. Excluding the coast of accomodations, food and cost of other expenses that are catered for by the student.

Apart from that students are given opportunities to work online with Edoofa but they are not paid in cash/striped but the money earned goes to the tuition.
22/11/23, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's absolutely right, Chrissy, I appreciate that you have gone through that thoroughly
22/11/23, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, is your family willing to support you?
22/11/23, 4:15 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Just give me time to discuss this further with them. then I will give you the answer.
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Chrissy
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Thank you.

Linda Kachoka
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Ms. Linda,
I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Austin, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application of Chrissyfor the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Its nice connecting with you mam
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Chrissy, Now, I thought you had a final discussion with your family, so, what's the conclusion?
23/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Yeah we discussed they are willing to help but the cost is too much, especially the cost of accomodation. I was wondering if you would be able to help me with the cost of accomodation?
23/11/23, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this, Chrissy
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +44 7793 230619: So Chrissy is an opharn dhe has no parents we are just aunties and uncles that help her to be independent.  This is an opportunity that iam  sure it would help alot in her career development.  The issue here is that we can't afford to pay for her accommodation.  We can try to ensure that she has food but our family can not afford to pay for her accommodation for 2 years. Chrissy is a hard working girl and she will do well in this programme.
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Chrissy, Please note that again the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship on tuition and Accommodation but the remaining cost after the scholarship and Transportation is catered by a student's family. I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +44 7793 230619: Are there any avenues that she can be assisted with this?
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +44 7793 230619: Noted. Thanks for this.
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: May you please breaf us on this.
23/11/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Linda, I appreciate your efforts from the start as you are helping Xhrissy by going out of the box but as per the program we are offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and one can have the higher quantum based upon the hardwork he/ she will put and secondly once Chrissy will found eligible in the program there and then her Admission and The EWYL Program will be started and through the EWYL Program she can self finance her education on her own by earning scholarship credits worth 50-100$ a month that will lessen the burden from you and you will only have to look for the accomodation expense because she can self finance the tuition fees and I have faith in her too
23/11/23, 2:23 pm - +44 7793 230619: Thanks for the information
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - +44 7793 230619: It will be sad if Chrissy has to miss out on this amazing opportunity because she can not afford to get support with her accommodation as she is really looking forward and so geared up for the programme.
23/11/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know according to you how much will be the cost of accomodation?
23/11/23, 2:34 pm - +265 882 92 11 85: Probably 7/8000 rupees per month, we aren't sure but it seems expensive as none of us has been to India before, please you may shed more light on that if possible.
23/11/23, 2:35 pm - +44 7793 230619: Which side of India would the course be studied?
23/11/23, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Linda, Please note that the cost of Accommodation is already a part of the cost of the reduced cost of education as mentioned by your child earlier. Have you noticed this?
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +44 7793 230619: No, I did not. Will check properly.  Thanks.
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please go through that again and let me know!!
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - +265 999 68 63 93: Please explain this in detail I don't understand

23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Sir, by this, it was meant that Just to clarify, once Chrissy will be getting a percentage of scholarship based upon a few factors and the scholarship will not only reduce the Tuition fees but also the reduced education cost already includes accommodation expenses.
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +44 7793 230619: So what do Chrissy need to do now?
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: For now, she need to complete this personalized counseling session and after this she will be promoted to Step 2 that the eligibility test and interview which she has to clear!!
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - +44 7793 230619: Okay. Noted. What does the eligibility test consist of?
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +265 999 68 63 93: Am still not clear especially on accommodation. Anyway as my sister said we can't afford accommodation. And this is sad for Chrissie.

28/11/23, 12:33 am - +44 7793 230619: Hi Team. I think from our side we have just realised that we will not be able to afford to support and fund Chrissy's  accommodation.  So I feel Chrissy is deflated at the moment.  So I am not sure if she will be able to continue on the programme because she knows no none who can support her with the accommodation.  Please advise what Chrissy should do now . Should she continue with the programme?
