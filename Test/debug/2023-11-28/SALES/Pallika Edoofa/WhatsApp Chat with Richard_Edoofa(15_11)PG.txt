17/11/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No Richard, As, continuing the discussion, Please let me know if you want to pursue medicine, why haven't you chose Physics in L5?
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I initially was given physics but I heard biology is more linked to medicine
17/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 592 5684: And especially here they say Chemistry is the main determinant and either of Biology or Physics to pursue medicine
17/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
17/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 592 5684: What about mechanics?
17/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I have thoroughly understood that but at this point in time it won't be possible to change back to physics
17/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Mechanics as a subject?
17/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that!!
17/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 592 5684: So does it mean I won't be able to take medicine at University
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

17/11/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, I understand it's a shift, but your readiness to adapt is commendable. Remember, flexibility is a valuable skill, and embracing change doesn't necessarily take you away from the medicine field—it might just lead you to a different yet equally meaningful path within it.

18/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 592 5684: In 5 years I see myself as a biotechnologist working for a biotech company in India, Zimbabwe or any country on the globe. The initial plan is to work outside and get experience and exposure from those already in the industry then come back home and have startups that will be on track to big companies such that Zimbabwe is developed
18/11/23, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!
I hope that you are doing well today.

May I know if you are available for the session?
21/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 592 5684: How are you @917982048840
21/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I have a school competition and won't be making it for sessions the rest of the week

21/11/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Richard, Thank you for sharing this, Please let me know if you are available now or your parents can participate on your behalf.
21/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 592 5684: We can have a small session now despite my tight schedule I'm eager to be an Edoofian
21/11/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know this.
21/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 592 5684: India has a great tech, innovation and entrepreneurial hub I can be exposed to these and further my knowledge of this world
21/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 592 5684: By having an academic certificate from India i will already be halfway from getting a career worldwide. India has quite experienced higher education educators
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Yes it's quite expensive especially without a scholarship and i can safely say without a scholarship I won't make it overseas
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Richard, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 9:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Yess it is somehow within reach
21/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 592 5684: But I will have to be part of Earn while you learn program
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!

I am here to begin the session, 

Shall we begin the session?
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!!
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
22/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Not really but you talked about excelling academically and having community initiatives
22/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 592 5684: How are you sorry I don't mean to cause inconveniences but do you have the list of questions so I can work on them let me say four questions per day and we discuss from there
22/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Because I feel bad or rather I look uncommitted by missing session time but I don't want it to stain my evaluation since my goal is Edoofa program at all costs
22/11/23, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Richard!!!
22/11/23, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Richard, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
22/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 592 5684: Understood
22/11/23, 5:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
22/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I think it's a great thing and places the student up to date with trends of  nowadays
22/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I can say I now understand this 360 degrees
22/11/23, 5:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's true!!
22/11/23, 5:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
22/11/23, 5:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
22/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 592 5684: All of them are outliers in terms of comparative advantage over other unis worldwide but I will take into account the 4th point that you help a student through and through I really like that one
22/11/23, 5:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

22/11/23, 5:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 592 5684: My mother
22/11/23, 5:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 592 5684: I will have a frank discussion with them today ...the barrier right now is that I am at a boarding school
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand as we are about to end the session and you can have the discussion with your family and as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
22/11/23, 5:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
