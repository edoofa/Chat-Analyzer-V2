*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 894 6404: Yes we can begin
24/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: Alright, so Mrs Matsilele, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Chelsy, is that correct?
24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 894 6404: Yes my son heard about Edoofa Program from that person and related it to me
24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Chelsy, also do tell me whether you learnt about Chelsy’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 894 6404: He said that its  a program in the SAARC nations and the African continent that offers 50-100percent scholarships on tuition fees and that it works with 250+Universities in India. Its aim is to make education affordable and get children access to jobs .As for Chelsy l heard he already got a scholarship and is looking forward to studying in lndia thats all in brief.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: Yes that is correct, I see you are well informed.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 894 6404: Ohh okay that's great and l didn't know that
24/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 894 6404: That is significantly true
24/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 446 3561: Excuses ladies and gentlemen  and soory for not being intouch ,l was out of bundle for the past few days now l am available
24/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure connecting with you Jeptah.
24/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 446 3561: I have hope that l can be one of them
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Okay so Jeptah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l am assure that l can but starting tomorrow where l am currently located  there is a network glitch
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: Let us try to stay connected today as much as we can.
24/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay lets continue

25/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay noted
27/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay
27/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 446 3561: What are the qualifications and number of years it takes please  further explain
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Sagar: Yes let me brief you about the program.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: After being awarded the B.Com degree, candidates can either look for jobs in various departments or opt for higher education.

*B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*

*B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
27/11/23, 10:20 am - Sagar: And I would like to bring your attention that this course also enables you to become an Actuarial scientist.
27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 446 3561: That's great 🎯
27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 446 3561: What about the requirements
27/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 446 3561: Or qualifications
27/11/23, 10:48 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 446 3561: I hopefully am sir but lwas asking the points needed for B.com
27/11/23, 11:00 am - Sagar: We need 4 points in A-level for B.com .
27/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 894 6404: Which include which subjects
27/11/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: You can score 4 points in any 2 subjects.
27/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 894 6404: Okay understood l didn't what to say but l thing my son will qualify cause  he has high hopes
27/11/23, 11:36 am - Sagar: That is great Mrs.Matsilele.
27/11/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: So did you understand the course?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l did thanks l thing it is the course l need cause it's in line with my goals
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sagar: That is great, since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
27/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay sir have a good evening
