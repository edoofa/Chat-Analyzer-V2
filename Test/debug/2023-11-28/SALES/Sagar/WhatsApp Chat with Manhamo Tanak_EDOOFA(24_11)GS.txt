24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Manhamo, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Ruvimbo, is that correct?

24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ruvimbo, also do tell me whether you learnt about Ruvimbo’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 964 1414: I learnt that Edoofa is a  program that offer scholarships  that helps children to study at best universities in India and it is an advantage to those who would want to help their parents in paying fees and you will be learning same working same time
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 964 1414: It offers the scholarships from 50% to 100 %
24/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 964 1414: I didn't learnt about euvimbo Jurney  and Expirience with Edoofa
24/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 964 1414: R*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: Noted.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program myself.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 964 1414: That true
24/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Yah thanks l get it
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sagar: Okay so Manhamo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 964 1414: No
24/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: Why are you saying so Manhamo?
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Ummm sorry Mr Gurvinder first l didn't get it  but now l understand

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts in Geography*
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Ok it nyc tooo
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Yaaah l have the confident
25/11/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 204 5981: Good day ,thank you for giving me this opportunity to show case my interest regarding about the education of my son Tanaka Manhamo as well as the possibility of getting scholarship in India .I am very excited about it and supportive as a mother sory yesterday I was offline due to network issues where I am working in rural area .may you kindly go ahead with your assistance
25/11/23, 10:07 am - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
