01/11/23, 2:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It is indeed a pleasure to engage with you, Josephine. Before we commence the session, I would like to provide you with some important instructions:

1. Your active and enthusiastic participation is highly encouraged throughout the session, as it will be a significant aspect of your evaluation.

2. When responding, please refrain from using abbreviations or short forms. Your answers should clearly articulate why you are a deserving candidate for the scholarship.

3. We emphasize the importance of sharing accurate and truthful information during this session.

4. Feel free to raise any questions or concerns at any point during the session, and I will be more than happy to address them promptly.

5. If you anticipate needing a break or have other important commitments, please notify me in advance. This allows us to allocate your counseling session accordingly, should another slot be available.

6. *I would like to bring to your attention that due to the high volume of applications, each applicant is allotted a limited two-day window for the evaluation sessions. If the session is not completed within this timeframe due to delays on your end, it may result in the invalidation of your application.*

7. *Lastly, I kindly request you to add your parents to the group and introduce them to the board members. This will enable them to participate in this counseling session and directly address any questions or concerns they may have. Even if they are not available at this moment, they can still join the group and catch up with the ongoing discussions later.*

01/11/23, 3:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Josephine. However, can you please send her national ID to be attached in the student's scholarship file which will be shared afterwards during the embassy evaluation?
01/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 6220560: Which file
01/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Josephine. The Embassy Evaluation is a meticulous process that demands precisely accurate information for seamless visa processing. Hence, we make an effort to gather all the information stored in a student's scholarship file to facilitate a seamless onboarding process. <This message was edited>

07/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hello Josephine, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
27/11/23, 11:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hi Josephine, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Monday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
