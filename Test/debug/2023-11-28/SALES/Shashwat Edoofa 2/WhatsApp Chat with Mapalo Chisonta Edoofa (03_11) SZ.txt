09/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about that, Mapalo. May I know whether everything is alright, please?
09/11/23, 9:00 pm - +260 776721363: Everything is okay
09/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted, Mapalo. Can you please acknowledge this question?
09/11/23, 9:07 pm - +260 776721363: Given quality education I’ll study hard and put in a lot of effort to achieve my goal of getting degree and masters.
Studying in India will also make me gain a lot of opportunities since degrees in India are globally recognized and it will open jobs for my dream job
09/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
09/11/23, 9:12 pm - +260 776721363: No I’m not.could you kindly tell me
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mapalo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation <This message was edited>

Are you ready?
10/11/23, 9:13 am - +260 776721363: Yes I’m ready
10/11/23, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mapalo!
10/11/23, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mapalo. May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
10/11/23, 9:21 am - +260 776721363: I’m having a good day how is yours?
10/11/23, 9:32 am - +260 776721363: The education
10/11/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mapalo You will be glald to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
10/11/23, 10:17 am - +260 776721363: Yes it’s very impressive. Please explain
10/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mapalo. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
10/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
10/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

10/11/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -

10/11/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
27/11/23, 11:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hi Mapalo, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Monday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
