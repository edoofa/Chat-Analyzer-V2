2. I understood the Benefits of the Edoofa Program that it is a work-study program for international students to study in India.
I understood that they offer a guaranteed minimum scholarship of 50%,  depending
on academic and extracurricular records.
I was informed that
there is an Edoofa's 'Earn While You Learn Program' where you get opportunities to earn
scholarship credits to further reduce the fees and self-finance in higher education.
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program

.
*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination* :  Advanced level (Maths, Biology, Chemistry)

23/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 733 4360: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 733 4360: I'm still to take my Advanced level transcript
23/11/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level?
23/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 733 4360: Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry
23/11/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
23/11/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 733 4360: Yes I am confident
Thank you
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 733 4360: Thank you so much
I haven't applied anywhere as of yet but I'm planning on studying foreign education and languages as well
23/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

As an edofian I think it would help me if I manage to undergo the earn while you learn program in the sense that it would help me practically, in the field during the course of the four years before I finish.
27/11/23, 2:33 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 733 4360: From what i have researched about the Indian Education System I have learnt that it offers top-notch education especially in the field of science because of innovation, research, and technology. Also the Indian educational system is more accessible, adaptable, and practical as a result of technology. I have also learnt that its technology-based educational programme offers a larger selection of subjects.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 733 4360: That's informative
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 733 4360: Thank you so much
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 733 4360: am very intrigued actually
Studying in India would help equip me in more knowledge and advancing since it's top rated and offering the top most rated educational system. 

This will give me new skills that are relevant to my field of specialization. I believe this would make me more valuable to my potential employers and my own career as an individual. This would also help me in gaining knowledge by providing me with in-depth knowledge on the course which will aid me in becoming an expert in the field.
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 733 4360: I am not very sure
I haven't researched enough on that
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 733 4360: Yes that is quite affordable and it's reduced as well
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 733 4360: No can you please explain further and what the career opportunities might be?
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
