So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 966 9192: Well l didn't research specifically with any country in mind l only searched about learning in foreign countries
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

07/11/23, 4:56 pm - Arshita: I am waiting for your response to continue with your session.
07/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 966 9192: Yes l ama
07/11/23, 5:07 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
07/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 966 9192: Well learning abroad is whole kind of new experience and therefore it uplifts my spirit of studying And also gives me room and opportunity to mix And mingle with people from other countries
07/11/23, 5:24 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
07/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 966 9192: No I'm not
07/11/23, 5:26 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/11/23, 5:26 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 5:27 pm - Arshita: In simple words Precious what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 966 9192: Ohh Oky l understood
07/11/23, 5:29 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
07/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 966 9192: I would want to know
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

07/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 71 966 9192: I think it is a great idea

Are we good to continue?
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 966 9192: Yeah
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
