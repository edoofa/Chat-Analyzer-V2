07/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Form 5 results fro the last two terms I will share after I get home from work
07/11/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

In the meantime can you please confirm me his subjects in A level?
07/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Had indicated earlier on
○Mathematics 
○Physics
○Technical Graphics and Design
07/11/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: Noted.
07/11/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about him achieving it.
07/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Am very confident he will get very well above the minimum requirements.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in your son studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 211 4784: I hadn't done any research prior to this process. My daughter wanted to study there in India two years ago, but the constraint was the cash for the education fees, without scholarship or sponsorship, so we just brushed it aside.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Yes
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Ok, so the process of eligibility is to be done prior to payment of the fees if I understood well the message above
07/11/23, 3:37 pm - Arshita: Absolutely
07/11/23, 3:37 pm - Arshita: The payment will be done only if the child is selected
07/11/23, 3:38 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 211 4784: I think I am getting the details clearly
07/11/23, 3:43 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 3:50 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
07/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Yes I think it's upto the enrollment process for admission into any university 
We are now upto the process of admission into fhe University
07/11/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
07/11/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
07/11/23, 3:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
07/11/23, 3:53 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/11/23, 3:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
07/11/23, 3:53 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
07/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Yes clear
07/11/23, 7:32 pm - Arshita: Since Alistar does not have chemistry, he is not eligible for engineering in mechanical or aerospace. 

At the same time looking at his subjects he is eligible for *Bachelor of Technology Computer Science Engineering*

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
08/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 211 4784: From the first session, I think we realised we can afford the enrolment fees and the cost of education. It will be a sacrifice for the child to pursue his studies
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 211 4784: We will afford though it will be a sacrifice
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin#276: I understand and appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin#276: Is Alistair available for the session?
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 211 4784: He will be available after 5 pm. when he is dismissed from school. Which is two
& half hours from now
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted!

The number he can use right now is
 *+263772882434*
08/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 211 4784: I have added a number that Alistair can use to come online now. This is his mom, my spouse. He can use this one for the session
08/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Good evening 
We have got two challenges here

1. Since we are formally employed, we can only raise the money ($200)at the month end.
2. A big challenge also lies in the degree courses you have shown us on offer for him.
He is not willing to pursue an engineering course, not in his interests, which he will not enjoy

09/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 288 2434: Now it's his mother. Alistair is at school and will be available around 6pm
09/11/23, 10:50 am - Austin#276: Thank you for informing
09/11/23, 10:50 am - Austin#276: I was informed by Mr Aleck that Alistair isn't looking forward to the course offered, may I know, what are his career aspirations?
09/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 288 2434: He says he wants to be an Aerospace Engineer. He pointed out that he could do Aerospace Engineering or Aeronautical Engineering.  Currently he is doing Physics, Mathematics and Technical Graphics. He has little knowledge in Chemistry as he did Chemistry at O Level
09/11/23, 10:58 am - Austin#276: I can understand and Chemistry is mandatory to qualify for Aerospace Engineering
09/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 288 2434: So what other field can he persue besides Computer Science.  He seemed not to like Computer Science
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Austin#276: He can pursue Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communications Engineering. We can also consider him for Commercial or Business courses, Arts, Design, etc
09/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 288 2434: Maybe you could provide us with a list of available trades preferably in Mechanical Engineering that he can choose from. Commercial and business No.
09/11/23, 11:23 am - Austin#276: Please note that Mechanical Engineering also has the same requirement as of Aerospace Engineering throughout all reputed Universities in India
09/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 288 2434: Meaning they also require A Level Chemistry?
09/11/23, 11:25 am - Austin#276: Yes please
09/11/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 288 2434: Ok. Will have to discuss with him about Electrical Engineering and Electronics & Communications Engineering.
09/11/23, 11:34 am - Austin#276: Sure, will he be available for a discussion on this group?
09/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 288 2434: Around 6pm yes
09/11/23, 11:35 am - Austin#276: Noted and can you notify on this group as soon as he is online
09/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 288 2434: Noted
09/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 288 2434: Good evening, this is Alistair speaking, sorry for any inconveniences due to my absense in the sessions, I am now available
14/11/23, 6:27 am - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 288 2434: Good Morning.  Alistair is at school now. We tried to talk to him about the other available trades that he can do but he seems adamant that he wants Aerospace engineering or Aeronautical Engineering. He said his other options can only be in Mechanical Engineering.
14/11/23, 9:32 am - Austin#276: Good Morning to you all!
How are you today?
14/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 288 2434: We are well, how are you
14/11/23, 9:35 am - Austin#276: Good to hear that!
I am doing well
14/11/23, 9:37 am - Austin#276: I do understand, since he doesn't have the required subjects, how is Alistair planning to proceed with Aerospace Engineering?
14/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 288 2434: He said there should be other options in Mechanical Engineering even if not in lndia.
14/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 288 2434: The requirement of A Level Chemistry is in lndia.
14/11/23, 9:43 am - Austin#276: That is correct, and you can ask Alistair to research well and take a decision as this decision has a significant impact on his career
14/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 288 2434: Yes. We were encouraging him especially on Computer Science as it is a good trade seeing where technology is taking us but he seemed uninterested.  It's an opportunity that we as parents were eager for him. However we pray he is going to find something along his interests. We however would like to thank you as Edoofa for having selected him for this scholarship. You can however open the chance for someone else. Thank Edoofa.
14/11/23, 9:54 am - Austin#276: This is well noted, if Alistair is online, I would like to have a discussion with him regarding his career goals and opportunities so that he is aware of the options ahead
14/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 288 2434: Ok. Thank you.  Will alert him. About 7 to 8 hrs from now
14/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 288 2434: Have a good day
14/11/23, 10:12 am - Austin#276: That would be fine, Have a great day ahead!

27/11/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
27/11/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Are you willing to continue the edoofa scholarship program?
27/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Yes, with regards to the request that we made last time
27/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 211 4784: The request was that Alistair wants to pursue Aerospace Engineering, but you said he doesn't qualify with his combination of 
●Mathematics 
●Physics &
●Technical Graphics & Design 
Therefore, we were saying, "Besides Aerospace Engineering, or Computer Science (which you say he is eligible), are there no other Mechanical Engineering Courses he qualifies for which he  can pursue?
27/11/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: No,besides computet science with the given combination he can only pursue :
*Bachelor of technology in electrical engineering*
*Bachelor of technology electronic and communication engineering*
27/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Ok, now I remember you saying that, and our conclusion was that you speak to Alistair about it and find out from him if he is interested and be willing to take any of those three.
He will be available after school and after 5pm today
27/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 211 4784: We as parents wouldn't have to force him to divert his attention from what he is mostly interested in.
27/11/23, 12:42 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

You can discuss with him the same and let me know the final decision
27/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 211 4784: Will let you know today evening
