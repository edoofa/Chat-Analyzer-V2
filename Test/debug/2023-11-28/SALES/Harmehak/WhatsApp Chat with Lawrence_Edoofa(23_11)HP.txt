Was there any challenge?
24/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 672 8657: ........yah l didn't had enough access to resources that's why

24/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: I can understand, Lawrence.

So why didn't you pursue higher education after A level please?
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Like wat l said  earlier my parents they can't afford to pay for my university fees becauses  of recently price hikes plus my father is no longer employed.....
24/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 672 8657: That's everyone's wish to pursue a professional course at tertiary level
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand the same, Lawrence.
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: So how are you planning your higher education in India, please?
24/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Through with ur scholarship program Edoofa l hope l will be one of the privileged candidate amongst other students
24/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: While I understand the same,

Do you understand that you would need financial support for your higher education in India with Edoofa?
24/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Definitely that will probably do ....
24/11/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
24/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk really understand the agreement
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 672 8657: ......l will be willing to  do taht
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: So Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee itself.
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: We donot offer sponsorship, Lawrence.
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk
24/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 672 8657: What do u consider if one wants 100% scholarship
24/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 672 8657: On the contrary,  what do u consider about 50% scholarship
24/11/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
24/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 672 8657: I understand
24/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk on academic excellence which points do u consider tho
24/11/23, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: A level points
24/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 672 8657: How man points
24/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Many points per say☝🏿
24/11/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Thats based on your entire application, Lawrence.

Equally other factors are at play please.
24/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Ok
24/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Lawrence, are you clear that with our 100% scholarship on tuition fee too you would require financial support from your parents?
24/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Noted
24/11/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: That was a question Lawrence!
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk really appreciate that information  too
24/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 672 8657: ........but l shall have a discussion with my parents regards that 50 % scholarship
24/11/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Lawrence, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Yes l totally agree
24/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 672 8657: So what about tuitions in India....
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: That's good
24/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: I will be discussing the same in detail as we move ahead.
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk it's I'm looking forward to that
24/11/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: Sure, meanwhile I await your response if your parents are willing to support you financially, Lawrence?
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Be rest assured, the costs are less than those in Zimbabwe
24/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 672 8657: I understand
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Could you please address the same?
24/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 672 8657: Olk
24/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
