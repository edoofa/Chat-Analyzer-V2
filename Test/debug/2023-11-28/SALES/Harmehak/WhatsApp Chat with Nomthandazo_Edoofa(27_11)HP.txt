You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

27/11/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know Nomthandazo better as a student.

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies along with what exactly would she like to study?
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 512 2044: She is very serious about getting educated as a girl child. She loves school and is a very good leader, she also plays netball at school. Her dream is to study medicine and become a doctor one day
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

It's a pleasure to know more about her!
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 512 2044: I'm very confident in my daughter
27/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Thank you
27/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: May I know her O level results and A level subject combination please?
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 512 2044: She has 8 O level subjects including Maths,Chemistry and combined science now she is doing Maths Biology and Chemistry at A level
27/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

Why didn't she happen to pursue Physics as well in her A level, Mrs Moyo?

I believe it's an important science subject, wouldn't you agree?
27/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 512 2044: Yes I agree but she didn't pass the subject at O level that's why she is not doing physics at A level
27/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
27/11/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 512 2044: So if she's not doing physics, is she still able to medicine by any chance maybe
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 512 2044: do medicine *
27/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.* <This message was edited>
