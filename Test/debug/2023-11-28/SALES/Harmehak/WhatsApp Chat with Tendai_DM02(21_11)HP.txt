How she is at school, her interests and hobbies along with what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education.
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Tendai is a quiet hard working girl who has dreams of doing medicine. She wants to be a Eurology surgeon to be specific.
21/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Her passion for being a Doctor has always been there since her childhood but the specialisation to the Euro route was brought about by mum's sickness as she suffered from cancer for close to 10years which she finally succumbed to so she would always say if only i had finished school
21/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently at Daramombe doing her A levels
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 340 7203: For Ordinary level she was at St Mary's Magdalene were she attained 9 passes
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently doing Maths, Chemistry and Biology
21/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She likes music and travelling
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you for the considerations...the help will indeed go a long way.
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I would like to express my grief to hear the same please.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Surely the students have to aim higher and give their best short and not focus on the minimum qualifying criteria.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I can see how that must have affected you all and her which eventually drove her to pursue a career in medical sector.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please.
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
21/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Good morning.
I am well thank you.
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Yes we can start
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Yes please, thank you
22/11/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: You happened to mention her subjects, 

However I can see she didn't pursue Physics in her A level, may I know the reason behind the same please?
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: Two factors were at play, When we explained to the school on what she wanted to do ultimately (medicine) they advised us on a combination to take which was Maths, Chemistry and Physics 2) She did not have the result that she expectedics, she had a C at O level which is normally a range of between 51 to 59% pass so she felt she did not do so well as compared to Chemistry and was afraid that it may be more difficult for her to pass the Physics at A. level.
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: sorry Maths, Chemistry and Biology there on the advise from the school.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please, I do understand.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 340 7203: Ooh owkay, so it means one has to do all the three at Alevel and 2 or less.
Like in this case she is doing Chemistry and Biology only of the mandatory subjects.
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 340 7203: How would we go about it in her case, is there room to use O level Physics passes.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: All three are a mandatory requirement.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 340 7203: Oooh owkay, very well noted.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 340 7203: Well received, we will have to share the information with Tendai and discuss on how we can go about it at this stage.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Thats completely alright please!
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
22/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 340 7203: thank you so much for your time, you were quiet helpful. I will get in touch if we happen to have any questions after discussing with Tendai

22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Will get in touch with the school and see if its possible...thank you.
22/11/23, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Surely please, Mrs Sandra.
