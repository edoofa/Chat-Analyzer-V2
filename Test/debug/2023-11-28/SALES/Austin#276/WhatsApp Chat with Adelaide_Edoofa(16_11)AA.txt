Also take note that we are not at home right now and we will take pictures of the final results certificate by end of day today. The picture we have is not very clear
18/11/23, 12:47 pm - Arshita: Noted. 

Can you please confirm your subjects in A level?
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 218 8531: null
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: Please share a proper picture, as it is required for evaluation
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: Noted
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I have asked someone at home to send pictures of the certificate
18/11/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Noted
18/11/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
18/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I am
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I am confident that I'll meet the minimum requirement

18/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 218 8531: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
18/11/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 218 8531: No application yet. But I have interacted with Parul University
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

*Bachelor of Technology- Chemical Engineering*

The course covers aspects of chemicals offering a wide range of career and higher education opportunities
Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Sure. That will be most helpful
20/11/23, 12:41 pm - Arshita: A *Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Chemical Engineering* is an undergraduate engineering degree program that focuses on the application of principles from chemistry, physics, mathematics, and engineering to solve problems related to the production and use of chemicals, materials, energy, and related products. This program typically spans four years and is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of chemical engineering.

Here are some key aspects of a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering:

Core Subjects: The curriculum covers a range of core subjects, including:

Chemical process principles
Fluid mechanics
Heat transfer
Mass transfer
Thermodynamics
Chemical reaction engineering
Process control
Separation processes
Materials science and engineering
Laboratory Work: Practical skills are developed through laboratory work, where students conduct experiments related to chemical engineering principles. This hands-on experience is crucial for understanding the practical application of theoretical concepts.

Design Projects: Students often engage in design projects, where they apply their knowledge to design and optimize chemical processes. These projects help develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work on real-world engineering challenges.

Internships and Industrial Training: Many programs include internships or industrial training opportunities, allowing students to gain real-world experience in chemical engineering industries. This exposure helps students bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements.

Elective Courses: Students may have the opportunity to choose elective courses based on their interests, allowing them to specialize in areas such as environmental engineering, biochemical engineering, polymers, petrochemicals, or pharmaceuticals.

Professional Ethics and Safety: Ethical considerations and safety practices are integral parts of the curriculum. Chemical engineers need to be aware of the environmental and safety implications of their work, and the program often includes courses that address these issues.

Career Opportunities: Graduates of B.Tech in Chemical Engineering programs are well-prepared for various career paths. They can work in industries such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing, materials, energy, and environmental engineering. Job roles may include process engineer, plant engineer, research and development engineer, and more.

Further Education: Some graduates choose to pursue advanced degrees (master's or Ph.D.) for further specialization or to enter academia and research.
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Well articulated. May I however ask for an explanation on the difference between a B.Tech and a Bsc Honours degree in Chemical engineering?
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: Certainly! The primary difference between a B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) and a B.Sc Honours (Bachelor of Science with Honours) degree in Chemical Engineering lies in the academic focus, curriculum structure, and the emphasis on practical application.

while both B.Tech and B.Sc Honours in Chemical Engineering provide a solid education in the field, a B.Tech degree is generally more geared towards immediate entry into the workforce with a focus on practical skills, while a B.Sc Honours degree may be more research-oriented and suitable for those considering advanced studies or academic careers. The choice between the two depends on the individual's career goals and preferences for a more application-focused or research-intensive academic experience.
20/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Ok. I now understand. I will have to discuss with her and make sure she understands it too. This will help her make an informed decision
20/11/23, 1:02 pm - Arshita: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
20/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 218 8531: The truth is I haven't researched on it. A friend just recommended Edoofa to me. That's how I got in touch
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.

20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

20/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Quite impressive
20/11/23, 1:15 pm - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I am not familiar with this
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:19 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 218 8531: The reduced cost is relatively cheaper than any other educational destination
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Zimbabwe has very high inflation and our schools are now pegging their fees in United States Dollars. So far I have been privileged because my employer has been assisting me with the fees. They however only pay part fees for basic education locally and not abroad.
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same?
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I would love to know more on how students work while learning
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I see now
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I will settle for number 4. It sums up everything else. Some of us had semi literate parents and had no say in the career paths we eventually settled for. There is no facility here that caters for interaction with us parents as you are providing us with here. I am glad the program doesn't give it all on a silver platter like other sponsorship programs without the students ' direct input into their study funding. And this gives me confidence that, if successful, I will be sending my daughter into safe hands because we have interacted.  These days of human trafficking its very tricky one could be tricked to send their children into slavery or other despicable social ills. If you are guaranteeing safe passage to her university of choice and keeping track of her progress, then I have minimal worries except to start working towards meeting my end of the bargain as a parent
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I have confidence that Adelaide can achieve more because it has happened to her before. In 2022 she got a grant of $1000 towards her fees because of outstanding academic performance
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: Amazing!
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 218 8531: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Arshita: Great!
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 218 8531: I have read through. May you please elaborate on number 3?
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will be guiding you about that!
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Ok. Noted
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
20/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Noted. Please go ahead
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 218 8531: 1. So eligibility assessment process is guaranteed to be through by 30 November 2023? The time has to be flexible enough to allow me to run around for the required deposit sum.

2. Is there guaranteed acceptance by relevant institutions and guaranteed funding after payment of deposit?
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Arshita: Yes, results will be out in November.
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Arshita: You will be given this payment plan to make things easier for you
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Ok. Noted
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Thank you for that
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Arshita: Yes, you will have a guaranteed 50-100% scholarship
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Ok. That's great
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 218 8531: First stage done.
20/11/23, 2:26 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Seems I had missed the key phrase of what "we have discussed so far". I had thought what we have done so far and thought we are yet to get the eligibility test results
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 218 8531: So let's proceed.
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: It's ok
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
20/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Yes I have.  I am now clear with the process
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

In the program, students are taught skills that are necessary for the working environment, essentially creating employment ready individuals who have experience in fields relevant to their course of study.

24/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 218 8531: The first issue is her name.  The full name is Adelaide Takura Sithole. I will be comfortable if you capture it as it appears on all her official documents

24/11/23, 3:34 pm - Austin#276: Sure, it will be sent to you
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin#276: Yes please, Adelaide can change to other courses during the Admissions process. You can inform me or our Admissions team about that so that you are guided to other courses that she is eligible for
