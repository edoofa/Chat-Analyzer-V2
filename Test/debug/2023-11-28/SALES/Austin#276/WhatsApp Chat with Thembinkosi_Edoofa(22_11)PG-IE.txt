22/11/23, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
22/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 797 3587: There are several ways that studying in India could positively impact my career. First, it would give me a chance to build professional networks and connections within the Indian legal system. Second, it would allow me to gain exposure to the Indian legal system and understand its unique challenges and opportunities. Third, it would give me the chance to learn about the Indian education system and its impact on students and professionals. Finally, it would give me a greater understanding of the diversity and complexity of the Indian culture and society, which would be beneficial in any career. As for how I would achieve my career aspirations, I would use the skills and knowledge I gain in
22/11/23, 6:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thembenkosi, Your thoughtful considerations regarding the potential benefits of studying in India for your career are well-noted. Building professional networks within the Indian legal system, gaining exposure to its nuances, understanding the education system, and immersing yourself in the rich diversity of Indian culture are indeed valuable aspects. It's evident that you've crafted a strategic approach to not only acquire academic knowledge but also practical insights that could significantly contribute to your career. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Yes ma'am
22/11/23, 6:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
22/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Yes , I did look on that
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thembinkosi, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
22/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 797 3587: No it is not
22/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that!!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
22/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 797 3587: No I don't ma'am
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
22/11/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
22/11/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
22/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I think the Earn While You Learn Program could be a great way for international students to gain valuable experience and earn some money to offset the cost of their education. As a student, I would definitely be interested in the program and would see it as an opportunity to learn new skills, gain experience, and make some extra money. The chance to build connections and network with professionals in the field would also be invaluable.
22/11/23, 6:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
22/11/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I understand
22/11/23, 6:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
22/11/23, 6:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
22/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Number two
22/11/23, 7:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

22/11/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 797 3587: You are correct that there is no limit to how much a student can earn through the Earn While You Learn Program. The amount a student can earn depends on their hard work and effort. As for the remaining fees after the scholarship and the program, I would likely need to find additional sources of funding, such as scholarships from other organizations, loans, or financial support from my family. I am also considering applying for part-time jobs that I could do while I am studying. This would give me additional income to help cover my expenses.
22/11/23, 7:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 797 3587: My family is very happy about my decision to study in India, but they are not in a position to help financially. I am looking for other ways to fund my studies
22/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thembinkosi, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
22/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 797 3587: It is
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Why
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I understand ma'am
22/11/23, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
22/11/23, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Stage 1
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Yes please
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!!
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
22/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Yes it is clear
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family - <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Austin#276: I understand, Thembinkosi!
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Austin#276: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
23/11/23, 2:01 pm - Austin#276: @263787973587 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I'm sir
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Austin#276: Glad to hear that!
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 797 3587: 1-law,, 2-india,, 3- $1750,, 4-$350,, 5-$350 but the parents can pay $200 in seven days and the remaining within next 30 days
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 797 3587: "Earn While You Learn" program is designed to help students finance their education while gaining valuable work experience. Under this program, students are paired with employers who are willing to provide them with paid work opportunities while they are pursuing their degrees. This allows students to earn money while gaining real-world experience and building their resumes.
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 797 3587: Yes that's clear
23/11/23, 2:26 pm - Austin#276: Thembinkosi, can you check and correct the answers of 3&4

23/11/23, 2:45 pm - Austin#276: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living

25/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 233 6411: Sorry sir for now Thembinkosi is offline,her phone is off she has got electricity problm
25/11/23, 6:26 pm - Austin#276: Good to hear that, Mrs Siphosiso!
I am doing well by the Grace of God
25/11/23, 6:27 pm - Austin#276: I can understand, have you gone through her Acceptance Letter?
25/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 233 6411: Amen🙏
25/11/23, 6:39 pm - Austin#276: You can feel free to address the same
25/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 233 6411: Yes sir bt there is challenge,as Thembinkosi's parents we are willing for her to proceed with her studies,for now we did manage to take her to this level which she is at with her education.As far as we know the situation of finance,we can't afford to pay the fees for her studies that's why we have allowed her to look for a sholarship🙏
25/11/23, 6:48 pm - Austin#276: I do understand the challenges and as you see, she has been offered a higher quantum of scholarship including tuition and living which is much lesser than studying in Zimbabwe. This cost can be further reduced through the Earn WHile you Learn Program giving the opportunity to reduce the cost of education even further or self finance her whole educational costs!
25/11/23, 6:48 pm - Austin#276: So don't you think is the best and feasible way to proceed with her higher education?
25/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 233 6411: I understand sir

25/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 233 6411: Our concern is that we won't be able to pay the fees,we thought you will assist her or give her job  which will give her money to pay all the costs while she is studying as well
25/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I'm here sir
25/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 797 3587: I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to pay the fee by the December 1st deadline. I understand that this is a required part of the application process, but due to my current financial situation, I am not able to meet this requirement. I am still very interested in the Edoofa scholarship program, and I hope that we can work together to find a solution that will allow me to enroll in the program without incurring any fees. I appreciate your understanding and assistance in this matter.
26/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 797 3587: I am writing to inform you that I am unable to pay the enrollment fee by the December 1st deadline. However, I will be able to pay the fee in November of next year, after I have completed my A level exams. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding.
