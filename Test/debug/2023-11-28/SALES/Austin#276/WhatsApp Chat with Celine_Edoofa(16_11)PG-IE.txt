18/11/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Celine, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
18/11/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

18/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes can you please add more light on that

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

20/11/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Well since India is characterised by quality education and career prospect l'm very much positive that this won't be detrimental to my career path
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Thank you for sharing this
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Caren, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 506 8620: No
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Celine, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes it is
20/11/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 506 8620: No l don't,can you please tell me
20/11/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Celine, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
20/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 506 8620: I think that's a great brainchild that prove to be very beneficial
20/11/23, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 506 8620: That's great.. thank you
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're Welcome Celine.
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 506 8620: 4
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*:

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn. <This message was edited>

20/11/23, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 506 8620: I can see that the EWYL program is very advantageous
20/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 506 8620: My dad
20/11/23, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is, Celine!!
20/11/23, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 506 8620: They are so happy about it and they feel this is going to be a life-changing opportunity for all of us
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Celine, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes l think that's it
20/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Celine,

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
20/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
20/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes please
20/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Celine, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
20/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Okay, but I have a question does one pay after getting the admission or
20/11/23, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please elaborate on this, Celine as I am unable to understand!!
20/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 506 8620: I meant does one pay the enrollment fee after being accepted
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Celine, once you are found eligible for the program you will need to pay the enrollment fee, after clearing eligibility test.
20/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Okay l get it now
20/11/23, 4:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!
20/11/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 506 8620: 4
20/11/23, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Sorry for the delay Ms Pallika, yes you can explain
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Celine, *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/11/23, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes l am, thank you
20/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great Celine.

21/11/23, 2:54 pm - Austin#276: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
21/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 534 7092: Am good . The Edoof Scholarship is a programme that helps the less privileged students  achieve their dreams  of getting tertiary education

21/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 534 7092: Am away from home

21/11/23, 3:22 pm - Austin#276: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program as of now?
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Austin#276: I can understand
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Austin#276: Well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Why and how can you gurantee that this program is going to be a life-changing opportunity??
21/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes they do have
21/11/23, 3:34 pm - Austin#276: Let me give you a simple example by comparing with higher education in Zimbabwe
21/11/23, 3:34 pm - Austin#276: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Austin#276: @263775068620 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin#276: I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
21/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Yes l am
21/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Okay thank you for that
21/11/23, 3:49 pm - Austin#276: You are most welcome, Celine!
21/11/23, 3:49 pm - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Does Edoofa help one in securing a job in India
21/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 506 8620: What are the qualities that makes one eligible for the Edoofa scholarship program
21/11/23, 4:11 pm - Austin#276: We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
21/11/23, 4:12 pm - Austin#276: Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations etc would be evaluated and final results will be compiled based on them
21/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 506 8620: Okay
21/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 506 8620: That's great
21/11/23, 4:18 pm - Austin#276: What else would you like to ask me?
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 506 8620: I think that's all for now, can you please tell me what you think l might need to know
