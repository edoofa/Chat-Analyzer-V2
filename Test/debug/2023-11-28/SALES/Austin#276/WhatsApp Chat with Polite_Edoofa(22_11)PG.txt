A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*

Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 816 2182: It is not affordble to my family ,, its very expensive
24/11/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Polite

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 816 2182: I dont know
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Can you explain to me
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Polite, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Can l ask you a question
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, polite
24/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 816 2182: So for the first time in lndia how can l afford to pay school fees because  by the time l am not doingEarn While You Learn Program
24/11/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Polite, Please note that Once you successfully clearing the eligibility test and interview and meeting the program's criteria, the next step involves enrolling in the program. I will provide guidance on the installment process for the enrollment fees. Once enrolled, your admission and the Earning While You Learn (EWYL) process will commence. It's noteworthy that, even before your arrival in India, you'll start accruing scholarship credits, amounting to $50-$100 per month. This ensures that your journey towards education and personal development is not only enriching but also financially supported
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you very much for the information
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No Problem, Polite, Also, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Polite, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 816 2182: I like number  4 Higher Education Concierge
24/11/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Higher Education Concierge

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

24/11/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 816 2182: I dont have any helper 
From A level l pay my school fees on my own
24/11/23, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate that, but you have also shared that they will manage that by struggling hard
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 816 2182: I mean myself ,  l can contribute $100 my parents only encourage me bt not financially
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Polite, your small efforts carry significant weight, considering it's a one-time investment. Your hard work, combined with the scholarship credits, paves the way for a bright future. It's commendable that you've managed to save $100 on your own.
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you for your encouragement
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No Problem, Polite
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 816 2182: They like it  as it is their wish  to fulfill my wish
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Polite, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Yes it is
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Explain to me
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Polite, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
24/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Can l ask
24/11/23, 4:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please ask what you want to ask
24/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 816 2182: How can l pay money after whatsaap chart,  shoul l not have to pay if l apply scholarship direct to the school where l pay tution fee thenthe school inform me that get a scholarship  is it not the process
24/11/23, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Polite, Please note that you are not supposed to pay the enrollment fee after our conversations, we won't be accepting that. Only those students who have gone through the eligibility check stage and passed the interviews will receive the Acceptance Letter after which they are supposed to pay the enrollment fees.
24/11/23, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This is one of the procedures for the scholarship . Now, there are different types of scholarships where the procedures vary. At Edoofa, the enrollment fee is reduced to a significant level and you are supposed to pay it of qualified for the reasons that we discussed above
24/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Alright you
24/11/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Thank you for further explanation
24/11/23, 4:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Polite, I was asking a question.
24/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 816 2182: We are still in stage 1
24/11/23, 4:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
24/11/23, 4:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Alright
24/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Yes
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Polite, *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
24/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 816 2182: That one gives me hope thank you very much Palika
24/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Very clear
24/11/23, 5:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
24/11/23, 5:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

27/11/23, 3:24 pm - Austin#276: I understand, have you compared the costs through the Edoofa program with that of Zimbabwean universities?
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Yea we compare and we discovered that Zimbabwean universities are too expensive
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Austin#276: Noted Polite, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Austin#276: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 816 2182: Yes l am looking for that
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Austin#276: Good to hear that!
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
