By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?

11/09/23, 2:32 pm - Arshita: Travolta, Edoofa is a merit based scholarship providing 50-100% scholarship. 

The quantum of scholarship depends on various factors such as academic achievement, co curricular activities and participation in these sessions.
11/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky i understand well noted madam
11/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 901 9588: So is it possible for l to attain 100% scholarship?
11/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: The final percentage will be decided after the final interview.
11/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Highly comsiderable madam
11/09/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
11/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Mmm i am not familiar with it madam due to the  fact that what actually intrigued me is that  it may offer 100% scholarship  depending with academic qualifications n other factors
11/09/23, 2:40 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/09/23, 2:41 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
11/09/23, 2:41 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Noo  madam  actually as for my parents  the amounts there are unaffordable due to the quality of work
11/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky i understand  well
11/09/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
11/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 901 9588: This is now up to them to decide but by consent and my aim is to attain the scholarship something that i longed for since infancy
11/09/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support you financially with your education abroad?
11/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes i am  aware madam thus why i hv applied for the Indian edoofa scholarship .Depending with  the % scholarship i will be offered
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
11/09/23, 2:57 pm - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
11/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Thus what i actually  like i understand  oky .Howis it done?
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
11/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Well noted
11/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes yeah a lot  thus what i like
11/09/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
11/09/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Thus  adaptable  here in my country  its rare to attain earn while learn programmes depending with the institutions
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky i understand here
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/09/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
11/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Definitely aware of the importance of EWYL
11/09/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
11/09/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
11/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Actually this one is the best
11/09/23, 3:13 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

11/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yea it's beneficial i like it
11/09/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky. My parents if they  afford to
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky Madam  i hop there are listening to our session  they will hv a word  on that if they are not busy maybe later
11/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
11/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
11/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
11/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes madam
11/09/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
11/09/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/09/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
11/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 901 9588: 1 academic records
11/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 901 9588: 2,proof of language proficiency
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 901 9588: 3'statement of purpose
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 901 9588: 4,letter of recommendations
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Proff of payment wc is financial doc
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: That is correct!
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
11/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Noted madam
11/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Let me first consult my parents  n came up with  a conclusion of agreement madam
11/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes
11/09/23, 3:38 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/09/23, 3:38 pm - Arshita: However Travolta, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky madam well noted
11/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Its okay i understand
11/09/23, 3:43 pm - Arshita: So very importantly, 
I want to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. *But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting.Therefore, after the evaluations the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/09/23, 3:43 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met5 the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes yes madam i am aware of that full time
11/09/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 901 9588: I understand madam
11/09/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
11/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 901 9588: I am sure we only left with number 6
11/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 901 9588: But we highlighted it a bit on the issue of visa
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: We have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Alright madam
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/09/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
11/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Noted
11/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Oky
11/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Clear
11/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 901 9588: Yes madam
11/09/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
