I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
31/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 476 4559: Yes we can proceed
31/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 962 8066: Yes we may
31/10/23, 7:22 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
31/10/23, 7:22 pm - Kunal: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
31/10/23, 7:22 pm - Kunal: Since she is not having Physics, I regret to inform you that she is not eligible for Medicine, but considering her interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that she is eligible for and which can help fulfill her dreams of working in this field

01/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 476 4559: Elaborate
01/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
03/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 476 4559: Wow thus great, so if the student is a hardworker balancing both studies and EWYL program  may reduce financial costs
03/11/23, 11:07 am - Kunal: That is right, Mrs Cynthia
03/11/23, 11:07 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
03/11/23, 11:07 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
03/11/23, 11:08 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
03/11/23, 11:08 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
03/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
03/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation.

07/11/23, 3:26 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Lorraine with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 476 4559: Her father and I will be helping her
07/11/23, 3:29 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 476 4559: As the world is becoming something that we can not define, I am scared. However, l put her in the hands of the one who created her to protect  her all the way.
07/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 476 4559: On the other hand am happy that she will make something for her future and become a recognizable individual
07/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

Stay Blessed!
10/11/23, 7:44 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing today?
10/11/23, 7:56 am - +263 78 476 4559: Doing great
10/11/23, 8:03 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
10/11/23, 8:03 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
10/11/23, 8:17 am - +263 78 476 4559: Academic results
10/11/23, 8:17 am - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
10/11/23, 8:17 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/11/23, 8:18 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 476 4559: So the enrolment fee is $350
10/11/23, 8:23 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
10/11/23, 8:23 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
10/11/23, 8:23 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 476 4559: Thus great
10/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 476 4559: So what qualifies the student to be eligible.
10/11/23, 8:43 am - Kunal: Let me tell you in the next stage, you will be having eligibility check interview which you need to clear in order to be found eligible
10/11/23, 8:44 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 476 4559: In terms of discussion I think you have summarized all as there is nothing which you haven touched  except  for the eligibility test if I follow well
10/11/23, 8:52 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
10/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 476 4559: Ok
10/11/23, 9:01 am - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
10/11/23, 9:01 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
10/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 476 4559: You are talking to the parent
10/11/23, 9:08 am - Kunal: Yes, I am aware of that, Mrs Cynthia
So, are you clear with the process?
10/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 476 4559: I get it
10/11/23, 9:13 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
10/11/23, 9:13 am - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of Lorraine's career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if Lorraine is found eligible for the program*

I was expecting to hear from you, It's crucial that we maintain our schedule to ensure a smooth application process. We're receiving a high number of applications, and being punctual is vital to keep your application on track else it will be on hold and sent back on the waiting list or even revoked. In case of any challenges, do not hesitate to share with me as that would be the best way I can guide you!
14/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 476 4559: Hie
14/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 476 4559: Lorraine doesn't have a phone in the mean time and am the one responding to your questions and sometimes  I will be busy with back to back lectures and some college  stuff to as a final year student there is much pressure
14/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 476 4559: Yo may proceed will respond
14/11/23, 11:20 am - Austin#276: Good to hear from you, Mrs Faith

14/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 476 4559: Yes, it is a good program and also develop self independence  to the students
14/11/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 476 4559: It provides a chance for them to achieve their learning goals
14/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 476 4559: What will we be looking at exactly on the eligibility  check stage
14/11/23, 11:32 am - Austin#276: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
14/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 476 4559: It is the greatest opportunity  as more other skills than her medical career will be achieved
14/11/23, 11:33 am - Austin#276: In the eligibility check stage, your child will have the scholarship test and interview with the Program Director. In that cases where the child is occupied with lessons or exams, we allow parents to participate in the eligibility check stage.
14/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 476 4559: Owk
14/11/23, 11:35 am - Austin#276: What else would you like to ask me please?
14/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 476 4559: So the questions will not be directly for her
14/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 476 4559: Are there no questions  which require her to partake
14/11/23, 11:37 am - Austin#276: I will have an interaction with Lorraine once she is available and will be guiding her. She can use your device for communication
14/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 476 4559: Owk that can can be done on Sunday I will be at home
14/11/23, 11:39 am - Austin#276: That's alright
14/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 476 4559: Thank you
14/11/23, 11:39 am - Austin#276: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
14/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 476 4559: With the state of our economy it may be challenging  however for the education of a child as parents we will try our best for her to be enrolled
14/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 476 4559: I'm having network challenges
14/11/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 476 4559: May we proceed
14/11/23, 11:56 am - Austin#276: I can understand the challenges, Mrs Faith and I appreciate your support for your child despite them!
14/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 476 4559: It's the least we can do for them as parents
14/11/23, 11:58 am - Austin#276: As you know, A level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. So you will have a video interaction with our Program Director and I will have further discussions with Lorraine once she is online.

*So are you willing to take up the Video Interaction?*
14/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 476 4559: Yes
14/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 476 4559: This can be done at 5:00 after my lectures
14/11/23, 12:01 pm - Austin#276: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5.
