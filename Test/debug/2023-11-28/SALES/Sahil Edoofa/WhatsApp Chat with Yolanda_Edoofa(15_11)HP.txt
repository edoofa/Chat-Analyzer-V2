15/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Good evening .

I am Yolanda Moyo ,you have contacted the right person .That's true l applied for an scholarship. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 259 5895: So May you please share the process with us and everything .Are we going to be getting a full funded Scholarship ? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 259 5895: The pleasure is mine Ms.Harmehak .I will be waiting .
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Shalom!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
15/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright ,l got to know the program from her .

The Edoofa Scholarship is a merit and need-based scholarship program founded in India. It aims to provide financial assistance and educational opportunities to deserving and qualified students who are unable to pursue higher education due to financial constraints. The program focuses on providing scholarships for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in various fields such as engineering, medicine, management, arts, and more. Edoofa partners with universities and colleges to offer scholarships, mentorship, and career guidance to its selected students. The program considers academic performance, financial needs of a student .

Thank you that's all.
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

However I would like to correct that scholarship is provided on merit basis itself, Yolanda
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright Ms Harmehak thank you.
15/11/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Well understood l am looking forward to be getting a Sponsorship though😊 .Noted, you may Continue
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program itself.
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

I am following !
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must have understood that the scholarship is on tuition fee itself?
15/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes l did understand that it's different from Sponsorship and Edoofa is a scholarship its self .
15/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful

Yes let's continue thank you
16/11/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: I understand, how are you?

16/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
16/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright so l was reading that it's a organization which aims to help deserving students with life changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable education And on the financial aspects it reduces the costs fee to 2000\3000 as long the student maintain the right attitude merit .
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, have your understood the following?
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes Thank you l am following.
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: So far are there any queries, Yolanda?
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Noo

16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you $1500-2000 a year?

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

17/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
17/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 259 5895: Yes
17/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 259 5895: Yes l am doing well .I hope so for yourself

17/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 259 5895: Yes ,so they have plans for my education
17/11/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Alright, may I know why they couldn't acknowledge the same yesterday?
17/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 259 5895: Ms Harmehak ,mom was tired and Daddy so probably they will attend to me today it's self.
17/11/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I can understand.

What all did you discuss regarding the program with them yesterday along with the financial planning?
17/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 259 5895: They are supporting me regarding the program l want to do.
17/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 259 5895: This is the same thing we discussed yesterday
17/11/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: While I do understand the same Yolanda and that it can be overwhelming.

However, Would you agree with me that International education is a decision that you would require thorough preparations and discussion ?
17/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 259 5895: Yes
17/11/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Indeed, so do request your parents to acknowledge their support please.
17/11/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright l get it
17/11/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?

17/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes yes
17/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Go ahead please
17/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 259 5895: I was motivated by Aunt who is a lawyer right the way she handles herself she is so enthusiastic about life and all .Above all this l was motivated by my self because l realized my talents such as doing debate ,public speaking being able to be involved well with the crowd .l have a desire to make an impact in the public policy .I see my selfvery big l am convinced that this is my field .
17/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 259 5895: When l open my YouTube and seeing other girls woman and people being the greatest lawyers    out there motivates me to never give up on my dreams because l too want to open Law firms and l have faith that this will be achieved 😊
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful and well put across Yolanda!

I can see you have a desire to do better.

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course.
17/11/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law.

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general.

It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

18/11/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Yolanda.

Your thoughts are interesting.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/11/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
18/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 259 5895: I apologize for the inconvenience caused we had no Electricity
18/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes we are familiar with that
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: I understand
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 259 5895: I understand
18/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
18/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 259 5895: That's  a great thing
18/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Is it possible to get 100%schoolarship ,if a student gets one ,what would have been the case .
18/11/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2000*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
18/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright
18/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 259 5895: I understand
18/11/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: So far are there any queries?
18/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 259 5895: No
18/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 259 5895: So we are done
18/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 259 5895: ?
18/11/23, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: No please
18/11/23, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Hmm it depends on where you are studying.
18/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however these are the testified figures from Zimbabwe itself when Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe.
18/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 259 5895: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright l understand
18/11/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however comparing the costs for international education in India, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Yolanda?
18/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright l understand
18/11/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright l understand
18/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Hmm that's great l get you
18/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Yolanda, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Hmm so you have to apply in multiple universities
18/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 259 5895: ?
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Without Edoofa since it's not guaranteed, so students have to spend alot to apply at different universities.
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Can you share how much?
18/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 259 5895: 1500 dollars ,if it's 300
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: Yolanda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 259 5895: I think so too
18/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Alright
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.

18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 259 5895: Yes l do
18/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

18/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

18/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
