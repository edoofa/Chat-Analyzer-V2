21/11/23, 9:07 am - +91 95407 16843: Dear Esteemed Parents Langton!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - +91 95407 16843: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 9:28 am - +27 69 794 2759: Well congrats to you Sir

I am always happy to guide you through them. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 11:54 am - +91 83840 48513: Good Afternoon dear parents and Langton!

I hope you are having a wonderful time. I would like to let you know that I will be available for this evening at 6:00 PM CAT. So please stay tuned and relax for now, and let us connect at the said time frame. Please enjoy your afternoon!

22/11/23, 6:15 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
22/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 375 6311: Good evening how are you
22/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Good evening how are you
22/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can proceed
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted these steps are clear
22/11/23, 7:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:19 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Step 3 and 4 noted as well
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Step 5 and 6 noted as well and well explained
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can start  the process
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +91 83840 48513: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +91 83840 48513: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 118 4986: We can move forward

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Judging by the network  let's say 21:00CAT
22/11/23, 8:07 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for letting me know I shall wait for it.
22/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 118 4986: After watching these videos from 1 to video 4 hve understood  a lot in the  vedio . First there is a big emphasis on children to understand  well and being able  to follow instructions  for them to achieve  good results.in the video it is also point how the Edoofa program help students with a vision with different different  programs. Edoofa also helps student on University selection. Because the edoofa had 10 years ok experience wth these xul  better. And lastly the video talks about how import is the SOP document and how a students must take good care wen filling the document
23/11/23, 6:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Evening how are you
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can continue
23/11/23, 7:32 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 7:32 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 7:32 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 7:33 pm - +91 83840 48513: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 7:33 pm - +91 83840 48513: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted I have read and understood the videos
23/11/23, 8:29 pm - +91 83840 48513: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/11/23, 8:30 pm - +91 83840 48513: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 2:30 PM.
23/11/23, 8:30 pm - +91 83840 48513: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

25/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 118 4986: 2. To commence with, the difference between  a right and duties is that ,A right is a claim that one have against the state for example right to education ,right to medical facilities, right to equality before the law .A right is actually  recognised and it is protected by the state. For example the right to access to education is protected that is why we are attending schools collages and universities. That is why most of the rights are written in the constitution so that in the event that one is dined access to education can be able to stand up before any partial or competent court to claim for your rights .Furthermore  a duty is an expectation that one has to do for the society for example parents have the duty to act accordingly to provide emotional support to and shelter to their children  and most of this duties are protected  by the state. In addition rights are moral principles for certain standards which every person has by virtue  of being human being . These rights are protected by the state or international law for example right to security To add more civil rights are those rights obtained by people who are in a political party for example ministers ,members of Parliament.
25/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 118 4986: 3. To beggin with a prosecutor is a lawyer who decides whether to charge a person with crime and tries to prove that the person is guilty . In contrast an attorney will do the opposite they will work to provide enough evidence to defend their client who will be accused of criminal charges meaning they are authorised by the state to act on behalf of their client. To add more the prosecutor usually works in favour of the government whereas an Attorney arguesin favour of the client . A prosecutor works to prove reasonable doubt whereas the attorney attempt to create a reasonable doubt so that their client is declared innocent..A prosecutor only works on criminal cases while an attorney accepts both criminal and civil cases. Therefore one can be lowered to argue that this are some of main difference  between a prosecutor and an attorney.
25/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 118 4986: 4. To commence with, there are many branches in law such  as civil, coparete and criminal law .Civil law is mainly concerned with private relations of member of the society saving a primary source of law .Corporate law is the body of law governing relations,rights and conduct of persons company,organisations and businesses. Criminallaw is a system concerned with the punishment  of offenders and its main responsibility is to punish. Above all the types listed I found my self being certified by the criminal law. Mainly  this was driven by how the day to day running of the country and how criminals are being handled and its my sincere gratitude to pursue this career and live my dream and put effort in this field.This was also driven by my ability to critical thinking ,leadership skills, being  good at  problem silvingTis are some of the reasons which made me eager to pursue  this branchof law
25/11/23, 11:42 am - +91 83840 48513: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work.

25/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 118 4986: I'm doing good how are you
Yes we can continue
25/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 118 4986: 5. Being a successful lawyer is a process which requires skills on an individual . The following  are some of the skills I personally  have and think that they could  be of great use during my way to be a successful lawyer . These include teamwork, creative problem solving ,good communication and being able to work under pressure. To commence with  the skill of communication will help me in terms of developing an awareness of different writing styles and expand aporn work thereby paving way to be a successful lawyer. The skill of being a creative at problem solving will help me to have the opportunity to create tailored solutions to problems thereby moving towards success. To add more the skill of teamwork will help because if people enjoy working with you they will recommend you to others thereby paving way to being a successful lawyer. This way you will have to get to know new people much better.

27/11/23, 7:38 pm - +91 83840 48513: I am great. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I am ready we can proceed
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 118 4986: The above information is correct
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I'm ready  for the next step we can proceed
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - +91 83840 48513: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes it is no possible
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +91 83840 48513: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted on this one
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +91 83840 48513: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +91 83840 48513: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes Mr Sahil explained this to me
27/11/23, 9:50 pm - +91 83840 48513: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
