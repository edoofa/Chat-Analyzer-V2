Well Tanatswa is a kind of student who is so detemined and disciplined in such a way that i wont doubt him.
As a father i know that he is so focused that i dedicate  him to a winning  team.
His  strengths  are his determination  he is a goal getter, he doesnt give up easily. 
Partly on weaknesses, he needs a moral support  on all corners although  his weaknesses  are on book reading  meaning  to say that he must have time to socialise with others. As a person  he is so humble  and follows  what you assigned  him to do and he does it cheerfully with whole heartedly. As a my son i also respect him for that.

17/10/23, 1:48 pm - +91 82875 72068: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/10/23, 1:51 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Im not  much aware sir .... but will Tanatswa have an acsess to a scholarship?
17/10/23, 1:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Mr. Brighton. The *Edoofa Scholarship Program* extends its support to every deserving student!
17/10/23, 1:56 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Mr. Brighton! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/10/23, 1:57 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 1:58 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, If a student performs exceptionally during the evaluation process, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
17/10/23, 1:58 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/10/23, 2:04 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes its very much affordable sir
17/10/23, 2:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Brighton. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
17/10/23, 2:07 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir, please you can guide me.
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - +27 62 556 9098: I would like to know when are your semesters start?
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Brighton. The next possible intake is July-August 2024!
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Brighton. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -

17/10/23, 5:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: I will be waiting for your response, Mr. Brighton.
17/10/23, 8:48 pm - +91 82875 72068: A delightful evening to everyone!
17/10/23, 9:03 pm - +27 62 556 9098: A delightful evening to you Mr.Shashwat!

17/10/23, 9:06 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes im ready  sir
17/10/23, 9:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Mr. Brighton! Can you please acknowledge this message?
17/10/23, 11:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 7:04 am - +27 62 556 9098: Good morning sir ! Hope i find you well.Yes yesterday  it was  a hectic  day  for me .So yes i do acknowledge  those Webinars very well .They really  showcase every significant  session  and events  happening at the campus  .So much i saw it as helpful  to me as a father.
18/10/23, 9:05 am - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

*"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." – Dr. Seuss*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/10/23, 9:07 am - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir but im busy
18/10/23, 9:32 am - +27 62 556 9098: But i can be able to answer the questions  thank you.
18/10/23, 11:55 am - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Brighton!
18/10/23, 11:56 am - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
18/10/23, 11:56 am - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
18/10/23, 11:56 am - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
18/10/23, 11:56 am - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

18/10/23, 11:56 am - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how Tanatswa can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his parents? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 12:04 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes its a very important  program it will definately  reduce the pressure on us as parents
18/10/23, 12:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
18/10/23, 12:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
18/10/23, 12:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
18/10/23, 1:45 pm - +27 62 556 9098: To be  short and precisely  those four major facts mentioned  above  gave me the appreciation...namely
1.Affordability through guaranteed scholarships.
2.Employable through practical training. 
3.Earn While you learn :that's  the most annoying one .
4.Higher Education Concierge.
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Brighton. Can you please shed light on the phrase "that's the most annoying one"?
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Well this will motivates  the student for his benefits. Inorder for him to earn more he must learn more and also the  parent will be benefiting  in fee payment.
18/10/23, 2:38 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Mr. Brighton! I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how you feel about Tanatswa studying abroad?
18/10/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 556 9098: I feel very great  and it brings divinity in me that my son is studying abroad especially India
18/10/23, 2:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
18/10/23, 2:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
18/10/23, 2:49 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
18/10/23, 3:13 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Well explained  sir
18/10/23, 3:14 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/10/23, 3:18 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Thats an acceptable  payment plan i do agree with you sir
18/10/23, 3:18 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/10/23, 3:24 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Will share with you soon my battery  is running down .
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Mr. Brighton. I will be waiting for your response.
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Good evening sir please may you elaborate more on this question its ununderstable.
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Mr. Brighton. Can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Like it has been highlighted above that due to economic instability will be a major challenge they will be  a flexible fee payment option. Instead of paying the entire fee in 7days , as a parent  will complete  a part of the fee of $200 in 7days and the remaining $150 within  30days which is quite  reasonable
18/10/23, 9:32 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Thats  great  so how can he be found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, such that his fees will be reduced sir?
18/10/23, 9:37 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Brighton. As I have mentioned before, If a student performs exceptionally during the evaluation process (Tests and Interviews) he/she becomes eligible for the exclusive scholarship
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Because  i am very much  eager  that  he should have a quality education at a well renounced higher institution.
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Great!
18/10/23, 9:40 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Well, sir when is goung to be this  evaluation process ?
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Mr. Brighton, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 10:15 pm - +27 62 556 9098: We are still at 01 personalized Counseling session.Is it not so Sir?
18/10/23, 10:18 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Mr. Brighton. Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/10/23, 10:23 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes sir you can explain  it to me
18/10/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/10/23, 10:34 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Yes its all good ,although  it looks like  its long process and  requires patient...but i would  to thank you sir, for your patient  and well explained session.
18/10/23, 10:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/10/23, 10:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/10/23, 1:31 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Indeed the support and guidance you offered  her was very instrumental to the successful of her enrollment

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

26/10/23, 2:07 pm - +27 62 556 9098: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 1st or 2nd November 2023 for $200 and the  1st or 2nd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the  1st or 2nd of November 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

30/10/23, 1:18 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Thats wonderful,  will definately do that sir.
30/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Sure please, meanwhile, while I do understand that the deadline is of 6th November, the key benefit your child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of October 2023. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
30/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It would be much more beneficial for Tanatswa incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st October.
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - +27 62 556 9098: Definitely will try to do that.
30/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright please !
31/10/23, 9:27 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning,

I hope you're doing well today. Our director is currently at the university. If you plan to reserve your seat today, please inform me so that I can arrange for the director to sign your seat before leaving for his meetings.
31/10/23, 9:46 am - +27 62 556 9098: Good morning sir, you mean  my seat for  my son ? Please can you explain  more i don't understand when you say a seat ...thank you.
31/10/23, 9:49 am - Sahil Edoofa: Reserving scholarship seat of your child
31/10/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let me explain @27625569098
31/10/23, 9:51 am - Sahil Edoofa: @27625569098 like I shared with you yesterday, all the parents have an advantage of securing their child's seat for the month of October Intake, which I am sure you too would want for Tanatswa, isn't it?
31/10/23, 9:55 am - +27 62 556 9098: Yes you can reserve  the  seat sir?
31/10/23, 9:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so for the same you would have to complete a part of the fee formality today, I believe you would be completing the same today?
31/10/23, 9:57 am - +27 62 556 9098: Ok sir its not a problem
31/10/23, 10:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: So will you making payments from South Africa or Zimbabwe today ?
31/10/23, 10:08 am - +27 62 556 9098: I will be  making my payments  here  in South Africa  but  not today sir  but before the 6th of November to be honest. My funds are not yet in my account  but expecting them soon .
31/10/23, 10:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: @27625569098 I understand that, however I wanted you to have the benefit of securing Tanatswa's Admission for October round of intake which eventually would give you the early benefit throughout the entire process!
31/10/23, 10:15 am - +27 62 556 9098: So if dont manage to pay today what will be the effect sir
31/10/23, 10:17 am - Sahil Edoofa: While you shared that you might not be able to complete the entire fee of enrollment today, I was thinking of helping you out in a special way. 

While your due date stands to be of 6th November, you can secure Tanatswa's seat under October round of Intake by completing a part formality. After this you could complete the remaining part of the first part $200 anytime before 6th November
31/10/23, 10:19 am - Sahil Edoofa: There will not be any consequence @27625569098 since the exact due date is of 6th November, however, I believe you can understand that the key benefit of early application is for every round of intake, today is the last date of October round of Intake which means that by today if an applicant secures his/her seat they would have the benefit of an early applicant in the entire further process.
31/10/23, 10:20 am - +27 62 556 9098: Remember it came in without having planned if i could  have known earlier  i was even going to prepare but you only told me about it two days before its not easy here to get such an amount  within a period  of two days and to make the matters  worse its monthend  we need to pay our rentals  and also fees and food for other  kids at home ...but i will run around  if i manage to get it i will pay it.
31/10/23, 10:21 am - +27 62 556 9098: Oky thank you , but what are the benefits  ?
31/10/23, 10:23 am - Sahil Edoofa: @27625569098 I do understand that please, please don't get me wrong, I am not pressurizing you in any way, as your child's counsellor my focus is to ensure that the entire journey of Tanatswa is smooth, and while that happens you as a parent do not have any financial challenges in the meantime!
31/10/23, 10:25 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
