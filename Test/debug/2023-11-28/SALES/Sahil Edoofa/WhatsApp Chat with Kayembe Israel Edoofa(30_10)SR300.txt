The aim of Edoofa is to help deserving students to further their studies and also their career, this scholarship will continue if the student in which it is given to continues to have a positive attitude.

There is a 50% to 100% tuition fee and there are 1500 seats that are booked for African students in india.

After being qualified as a deserving student at Edoofa, they will send a letter of mine to different universities, this is after the interview with the director

The university that I will be enrolled into a university, that particular university will help me for the visa application by sending the admission letter and throughout this process the Edoofa program will give me an hand
