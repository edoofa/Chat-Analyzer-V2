08/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I believe it is a life changing decision because judging on the offers I m bound to get a chance to be exposed to many resources and due to the fact that I will be abroad it means I get to learn new skills I get to know about the way of living abroad and interact with people of different kinds It will also help me to expand and learn new ways of living

08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please.
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess I am ......so how many points are needed for me to qualify
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: So now, can you share your O Level results for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Social work ?
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Two Advanced level passes itself please.
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Please.
08/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Do I have to send the result slip or I can tell you how many Olevel I have
08/11/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Either would be alright please.
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I wrote 8 subject and I managed to pass 5

08/11/23, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: You can address the other part too please.
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I would like to educate people on things that might be harmful to their lives and that might be a stumbling block , make them have a brighter view about life and not give up because they have failed to obtain higher grades or whatever they wished for ...........I would like to help those that need help as much as I can and motivate them to not lose hope and keep pushing 

I would like to do social work because I as an individual has seen people who need help emotionally and financially but could not help because I don't have enough knowledge on how to assist such people therefore I'm very much willing to study and get to know about it so as to assist those that need help
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: I can see you come from a place to do well for others Buhlebenkosi.

Which surely is the reason of your kind heart.
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess Madam / Sir
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
08/11/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please
08/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok Ms Harmehak it's a pleasure to know you

08/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

What all did you understand please?
08/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: You can share a brief understanding. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I understood that a social workers motive is to build a healthy society and that they find ways and solutions to lower the level of discrimination, injustice and oppression .......and the fact that sociologist and social worker work hand in hand and have the same skills to help people and be able to build a good and healthy environment and support them with resources that they might be in need of
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Very well Buhlebenkosi, I am glad you thoroughly read please.

Shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology now so that you have an even better understanding?
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess sure ma'am

08/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow, Buhlebenkosi?
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess ma'am I did
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 693 1200: No we are not ma'am
08/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Great .....Noted
08/11/23, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 693 1200: So the money is paid in full for the whole year
08/11/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ow ok I understand so if I'm a starter I have to pay the amount in full right
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: No please
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: It's paid in installments itself.
08/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok ma'am understood
08/11/23, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: Buhlebenkosi, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 693 1200: For privates schools I agree with Mr Piyush
08/11/23, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: That's the cost for University Education please.
08/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: So are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
08/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess ma'am surely
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Buhlebenkosi
08/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I'm still reading what you sent ma'am
08/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: That's good, I am glad you are thoroughly following.
08/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 693 1200: So is the fee the same when I do online lessons
08/11/23, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/11/23, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: Which online lessons are you referring to please?
08/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I had not understood ....but then I know see that it says live online projects
08/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Noted ma'am
08/11/23, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: I understand please,

Yes, these are your online projects not lessons.
08/11/23, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: You are alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you thoroughly as well.
08/11/23, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I was still reading ma'am
08/11/23, 9:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/11/23, 9:31 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ma'am please can we continue tomorrow in the morning at 05:00am
08/11/23, 9:33 pm - Harmehak: No please, do understand that there's a three and a half hour time difference Buhlebenkosi.

Since we are only left with 10-15 minutes of discussion we can conclude now please.
08/11/23, 9:34 pm - Harmehak: Buhlebenkosi as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/11/23, 9:34 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok ma'am
08/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Around 600 to 1350
08/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok ma'am I understand so if I'm ready to apply the forms will be sent in this platform
08/11/23, 9:48 pm - Harmehak: How please?

You are to calculate 300x 5 and $450x5
08/11/23, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: No please, the admissions team assists you with the same and would discuss everything thoroughly.
08/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Oww owhky ma'am
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Sorry I had said x 3
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: I understand
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 693 1200: So it's 1500 and 2250
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: Correct
08/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 693 1200: That's good ma'am
08/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Noted
08/11/23, 9:52 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/11/23, 9:52 pm - Harmehak: Buhlebenkosi, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Im not understanding ma'am
08/11/23, 9:55 pm - Harmehak: The enrollment fee is paid after you are found eligible for the program and you receive an acceptance letter.

Which means your admission is guaranteed.

*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* 

Is it clear now please?
08/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Oww owk ma'am I now understand
08/11/23, 9:57 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/11/23, 9:57 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/11/23, 9:57 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yes
08/11/23, 9:58 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/11/23, 9:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/11/23, 9:59 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Sure it is ......wow this is amazing
08/11/23, 10:00 pm - Harmehak: I great to have you acknowledge, Buhlebenkosi.
08/11/23, 10:01 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yess ma'am
08/11/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/11/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/11/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

08/11/23, 10:06 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/11/23, 10:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/11/23, 10:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/11/23, 10:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/11/23, 10:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Are you clear about the same?
14/11/23, 7:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for your response.

14/11/23, 9:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Read this again
14/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I understand ma'am thank you for the clarification
14/11/23, 9:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same ?
14/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I think they are ma'am
14/11/23, 9:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you not discussed with them ?
14/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Yes I have and they are willing to help me as much as they can
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
I was expecting your response since yesterday may I know what challenges are you facing so that I can help you! @263786931200 @260974763211 @263778288547
16/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I'm so sorry ma'am yesterday the network was very bad then today I had an exam in the morning and had to travel afterward but then everything is now ok
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Wishing you all the best for your exams
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents please answer this ?
16/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Thank you maam
16/11/23, 7:10 pm - +260 97 4763211: Good evening Ma'mm I saw all the monies to be paid my challenge is the dates cow I only get paid mothend
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Buhlebenkosi, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Buhlebenkosi's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - +260 97 4763211: Yess Ma,mm
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Buhlebenkosi's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Buhlebenkosi's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
16/11/23, 8:58 pm - +260 97 4763211: It really sound better M,mm
16/11/23, 8:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are parents ready for the same ?
16/11/23, 8:59 pm - +260 97 4763211: Yess please
16/11/23, 9:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Buhlebenkosi's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
16/11/23, 9:08 pm - +260 97 4763211: Now my challenge is the job that I do Ma,mm I'm always behind the wheel as I'm talking to I'm in Zambia enroute to DRC

17/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 828 8547: It was ok thank you ma'am
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 828 8547: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Hello. Please assist me with responses to my questions. I need to make an informed decision. Let's assume that I get the minimum 2 points, will you still enrol me? What would the tuition be at that point? I need these  responses before I pay the money
17/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please go through this once if student fails then fees paid you will be refunded back to you
17/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How was your interview with the Director ?
17/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 693 1200: Ok ma'am I understand that thank you

18/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 693 1200: Good morning ma'am is it for the parents or I can continue since they are not available today
18/11/23, 11:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

18/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 693 1200: I'm doing good ma'am and how are you
