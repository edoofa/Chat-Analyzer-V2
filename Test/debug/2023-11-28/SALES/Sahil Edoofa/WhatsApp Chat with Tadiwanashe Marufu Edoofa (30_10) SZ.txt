01/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
01/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Yes
01/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
01/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
01/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 063 4182: 3.Earn While You Learn
01/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 063 4182: They feel that i will gain  experience new places and cultures, make friends from around the world, and gain a global perspective-while earning credits towards your degree. It will allow you to develop highly-valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability, and problem-solving.
01/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
01/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
01/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 063 4182: I think first, they should research the different universities and programs that they are interested in.  Second, they should make sure that they meet the academic and language requirements for their chosen program.  Third, they should prepare their application materials, including their transcripts, essays, and letters of recommendation.  And finally, they should be prepared to pay the necessary fees and expenses associated with studying abroad.
01/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
01/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
01/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Ok
01/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
01/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 063 4182: OK
01/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
01/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
01/11/23, 11:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 9:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Learning never exhausts the mind." – Leonardo da Vinci*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - +27 63 511 0486: Good day. 
I'm sorry she is currently in loadshedding. There is no electricity so her phone is Off. Is it possible to reschedule for tmre morning?
02/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mr. Walter. I'm truly sorry to hear that she's currently facing load shedding, resulting in the unavailability of electricity and her phone being switched off. I understand this can be quite challenging. However, I want to assure you that such situations are often temporary, and I hope that the power supply will be restored soon. I would like to kindly inform you that due to the limited availability of seats and the high volume of daily applications, we are adhering to a specific timeline for our sessions. If the student is unable to join the session, rest assured that his/her parents can continue and participate on his/her behalf. May I know whether you are available for the session right now, please?
02/11/23, 3:57 pm - +27 63 511 0486: I am still at work I won't be able to participate fully. Let me ask Sharon to help out if she's available
02/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly appreciate your sincerity, Mr. Walter! I will be waiting for her response.
02/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Good evening Mr Shashwat
02/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tadiwanashe!
02/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
02/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 063 4182: I think Edoofa helps us to understands that studying abroad can be a costly but Edoofa is there to help students to pay their finances alone with the Earn While you learn program  for students . In addition, Edoofa offers access to a network of financial advisors who can provide guidance and support throughout the process.  With these tools and resources, students can make informed decisions about their finances and ensure that they have the funds they need to pursue their educational goals.
02/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
02/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Ok
02/11/23, 8:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 063 4182: We have discussed stage number 1
02/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Yes
02/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
02/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Yes
02/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

02/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Ok so Mrs Ruth managed to pay her children's costs alone wow she is a brave woman
02/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education!
02/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer?
02/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Are your results determine the scholarship percentage you get or..
02/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tadiwanashe. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. Additionally, your academic results, your O level, and your A level results.
02/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 063 4182: Ok
02/11/23, 8:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer, please?

06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 585 3017: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th November 2023 for $200 and the 11th or 12th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 585 3017: The first one
