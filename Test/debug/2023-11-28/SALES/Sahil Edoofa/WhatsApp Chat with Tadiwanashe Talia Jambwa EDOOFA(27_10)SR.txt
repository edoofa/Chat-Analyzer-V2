06/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Good morning everyone Counselor Mr Sahil and others. 
Good morning to you too Family members. 


Firstly I would like to apologize for my late response was kinda busy. Secondly I want to thank you for your time you are always having for me, trying your best to get to know me better . Not wasting much of your time!!!! 

My name is Tadiwanashe Talia Jambwa, eighteen year old girl who is passionate about learning new skills that will lead her to a better life. I am also someone who loves about technology and its potential to change the world. 

I am a hairdresser at the same time I have my own small business I sell different fragrances to make ends meet. I am doing all of this but never gave up on my dream of becoming a digital marketer,also someone who has her own business (I want to be my own boss) . I have always been a curious and creative person who loves learning and finding new ways to solve problems. I first learned about marketing in high school, and I was immediately hooked. 

I wrote my "0" level in 2021, at Living Waters College in Zimbabwe Harare .I have five 'Os' which include Commerce C, Shona B, English C, Accounts C and History C. Due to financial and life constraints I was not able to continue with my school.Trying to find myself, I enrolled in business skills and ICT at Dzikwa Trust in Dzivaresekwa Harare Zimbabwe , I got the opportunity to try and showcase what I was able to do. 

I believe that whenever you want to achieve something in life you have to aim higher and focus with your goal. 

I am blessed with a beautiful family. My father is a buyer at TMB (Tobacco Marketing Board) VoedSale Company. And my mother is a part time worker, she's also a peddler. We are five kids and I am the forth one followed by my little sister she is in grade four. Others are older than me. We are a blessed family good people with a good personality, character,  so loving above all united and caring. God is in control in our lives, we are Christians too. 

Lastly but not least,I would like to share on what inspired me to join the Edoofa team. I just felt that it is rigorous and comprehensive, and I am confident that I would be able to learn the skills I need know and that will lead to become a successful person , how it is done to reach that level. I am sure that Edoofa is the best way for me to achieve my dream. I strongly believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn, finding themselves, whether it is business management, digital marketing, engineering etc, later somehow you will be able to use it to improve lives.  I am sure that someday I can use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.

 Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely
Tadiwanashe T Jambwa
06/11/23, 12:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself. 
So, could you kindly tell me how much *your High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
06/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 795 2919: My high school charges were $110 per term and my father is the one who supported my education. He is a Tobacco buyer at Tobacco Marketing Board and he works for VoedSale Company
06/11/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Great so before we move ahead with your course discussion can please share your motivation behind studying abroad and also please share picture of your previous qualifications results for evaluation also please mention the year of completion of A level ?
06/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Actually I did not go for A level. I only completed my O level and that was it.

I'm motivated to study abroad by everything. You will get to know more about everything. Life skills especially, you will get to know how to adapt to any situation in life, whether it could be at school, work or everywhere your are. It is for the best to know others peoples language, culture, religion and so on. Later maybe there is a job vacancy or a scholarship you will not fear rather you have to try and see how it ends and how it works. There is a high chance of learning new things abroad and even sharing your own skills to them too.
06/11/23, 1:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Why did you not go ahead for A level ?
06/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 795 2919: The thing is I didn't want to go for A level. I wanted to go to a Polytechnic and do my courses there. Like I mentioned before when u asked more about myself, due to financial and life constraints things were not in good condition that I could managed to go and do my course.
06/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you complete the diploma ?

On that issue I'll be seeking help, maybe u might have your own point of view.Also, if possible I would want to go further with ICT.
06/11/23, 8:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What do you wish to become in life ?
06/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 795 2919: To tell the truth, I am not that person who does not likes working for other people. I love doing things of my own. But for someone to grow, that's where it starts working for others and you grow.

07/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .

So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

08/11/23, 6:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
08/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Okay I hear you sir.

Mmmmmm I'm not sure how it is done
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Okay, so I've read everything. When I was going through it, I understood how it works. So I wanted to ask, how do they do it. In terms of one's program,will they ask you depending on what you are going to do and assist you on that . Also, in terms of working places where will you be working at... That side in Indian? please explain to me how it will be going.
08/11/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 795 2919: I noticed it is a good program EWYL, especially for people like me. It will be my pleasure to work for it as long it will benefit me later. I would like to try
08/11/23, 10:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child
08/11/23, 10:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
08/11/23, 10:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/11/23, 10:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/11/23, 10:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

08/11/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 795 2919: I'm following
09/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 795 2919: good afternoon sir ;
Yhhh we can start.
09/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 795 2919: So I went through everything and I understood.I would like to do the EWYL program
09/11/23, 6:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Following
09/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Number 4 Higher Education Concierge
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
09/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 645 1780: Yes boss
09/11/23, 8:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
09/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 645 1780: Yes boss I do so
09/11/23, 8:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
09/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 645 1780: I don't no how much is it boss .do you have any idea how much is it sir
09/11/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
09/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 645 1780: I can simply pay 600 hundred dollars for 5 different colleges boss
09/11/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Thank u sir.

Goodnight
10/11/23, 10:16 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
10/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 795 2919: Mrng Sir.
I'm good and how are you too?
10/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
10/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Have no idea.... How does it work?
10/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: They don't give any assurance and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge? <This message was edited>
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Yes I will try.
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
10/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Mmmmmm I'm not sure.
But I think it is a note that shows the purpose of what you are about to do
10/11/23, 1:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
10/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Yes I do understand it 👂🏻

I'm following
10/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
10/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Okay I have to spend about 750 to 1000 on 5 applications forms as well as 600 to 1000 for 5 SOPs
10/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

11/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Noted and happy Diwali sir 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
14/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
Shall we start our today's session?
14/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you
14/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Yes we can start.

Hwu sir
14/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Sure 🤝
14/11/23, 6:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Following

And the last part it's a good idea.
14/11/23, 6:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
14/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Okay thank you so much for your time and taking me through this training.
I would like to take this opportunity to share on what I have understood on the issues you have highlighted above.

So on the issue of financial aspects, a student is assured to to pay 350 in smu days that is if he or she is found with the skill for the program and before that there is a counseling session with the parents, students and seat reservation,which is found with the letter and the EWYL program...
After the student completes the payment and got the reservation letter, they are to begin the EWYL program, in which it helps the student to earn credit that will reduce the fee before their A results are out.
Mmmm sorry I want to ask concerning this issue,when u said A results what are those and where we would wrote them. Sorry for taking you back again
14/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 795 2919: I'm lost on that one A results
14/11/23, 7:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
14/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Okay now I understand
14/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Alright so for now we have covered number one, 2,3,and now we are on stage 4
14/11/23, 7:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
14/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Yhhhhhh
14/11/23, 7:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
14/11/23, 7:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for your response.
14/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Yes I'm following
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

18/11/23, 7:20 am - +263 71 795 2919: Noted sir
18/11/23, 11:27 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

18/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 795 2919: Ummm for now ey are not online
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd November 2023 for $200 and the 22nd or 23rd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 795 2919: I am following sir, even my parents are following through my phone.
They will reply with theirs
18/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?  Can parents answer using voice notes.
19/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let us reconvene for our session tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time with a fresh and focused mindset to continue our discussion. Your active participation in the session is an important parameter for evaluating your application.

As Psalm 119:105 says, 'Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.' Similarly, let our conversation illuminate the path to your educational journey.

21/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 612 9316: Hello Mr sahil I hope to find u well and your organization team.
So speaking to you is Tadiwa's father and behalf of her mother 
We have been goin through your messages and training towards our daughter which is a good thing. I also noticed your organization has the opportunity to lift children up and reach their goals,which is why we are here to support our daughter.. Going through your trainings I have understood that there is a high hope towards changing lives... Back to your reply  you were waiting for,sorry for late reply Sir.
So we agree with everything u are explaining to us, off course we fully understanding everything. So with that issue of payment will try our best to look for the 200 dollars, since we were supposed to pay it on the 22nd for now we cannot because of financial aspects , is it fine to start in December and complete the other one end of it or beginning of January depending with your payment plan how it goes after that one week of payment? 
Thank you so much and I look forward to your response like always.
21/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: I have observed that you have seen my messages but not responded May I know what challenges exactly are you facing?

If you won't share your concerns then how will I help you!
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 612 9316: Sorry am Tadiwa s father she just changed her number I will send it to you when send it to me boss
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 612 9316: Sorry am Tadiwanasje s father she just changed her number I will send it to you when she send it to me boss Sorry delaying you
22/11/23, 1:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tshuma's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tadiwanashe's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
23/11/23, 11:43 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263786129316 @263776451780 @263717952919 @263772478012 waiting for your response
