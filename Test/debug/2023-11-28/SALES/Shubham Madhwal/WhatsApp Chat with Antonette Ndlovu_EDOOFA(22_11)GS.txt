*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
22/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 478 4374: Online
22/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Antonette, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
22/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Not really
22/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sagar: Understood, let me brief you about the program.
22/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I'm looking forward to the scholarship
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sagar: Okay so Antonette, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
22/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 235 5640: I understand the importance of being proactive and engaging my parents in the process. I'm eager to put in the effort to meet these metrics and qualify for the scholarship
22/11/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: That is great, Antonette.
22/11/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: Alright so Antonette, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay to start with my name is Antonette Lindokuhle Ndlovu and I'm currently in lower six doing History, English literature and Geography .I would like to pursue a degree in the field of Geography as it has been my favorite subject since I started in form one . Specifically I would like to study Geomatics and surveying or GIS as I love solving complex problems and I'm interested in anything that requires practical work instead of an office job.I love reading novels and listening to music as my hobbies.

22/11/23, 4:44 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Geography, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?

I also believe Geography is multi disciplinary and has many different areas of study , Geography is always new and fun to learn . I also appreciate how Geography encourages thinking about how different places are connected to each other

23/11/23, 10:06 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
23/11/23, 10:06 am - Sagar: So do you think you can meet the criteria?
23/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I will definitely do my best to try meet the requirements
23/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: Great Antonette
23/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 235 5640: If I had the opportunity to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Geography, I would see myself five years after graduation working as an urban planner. I believe that this program would provide me with the skills and knowledge necessary to help shape the future of cities and improve the quality of life for their residents. I would hope to work on projects that focus on sustainable development, public transportation, and creating livable, walkable neighborhoods. I believe that the program at Edoofa would enable me to achieve these goals by providing me with a well-rounded education, including courses in planning, economics, and design. The program's internship and co-op opportunities would allow me to gain valuable experience in the field and make connections with professionals in the industry. I also believe that the program's focus on research and problem-solving would prepare me to be a successful urban planner. Additionally, the program's emphasis on international perspectives would enable me to work on projects around the world. In five years, I hope to be working on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives and make the world a better place to live.
23/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 235 5640: Also if I'm to become a graduate of a GIS and remote sensing program, I would see myself in five years as a geospatial data scientist, working in the field of environmental sustainability. I would use my skills to analyze satellite imagery, identify patterns, and develop models that help to predict and prevent environmental problems. I would use this information to inform policymakers and decision-makers, helping to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable future for all. With Edoofa's program, I would have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with real-world data, and to develop my problem-solving and communication skills. I would also hope to see myself contributing to scientific research, and collaborating with other scientists to develop new techniques and technologies. I would also like to be involved in educating and training the next generation of geospatial scientists. I would also hope to be a leader in my field, promoting ethical and responsible use of geospatial technologies. I believe that Edoofa's program would give me the skills and experiences I need to achieve these goals.
23/11/23, 10:52 am - Sagar: That is really great Antonette, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 235 5640: It's true that the career path I've chosen requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and I'm prepared to put in the time and effort needed to succeed. I know that it won't be easy, but I'm up for the challenge. I'm willing to take on every opportunity that comes my way, and to learn and grow as much as I can
23/11/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 235 5640: I have a few reasons for wanting to study abroad instead of in my home country. I believe that studying abroad will expose me to new perspectives, ideas, and cultures that I wouldn't be able to experience at home. I want to broaden my horizons and gain a global perspective, and I think studying abroad is the best way to do that.  I believe that the  quality of education at foreign universities is often higher than what's available in my home country.
23/11/23, 11:21 am - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 235 5640: Through practical application of knowledge which I would have gained from my studies. I will start by sharing my knowledge and experiences with other educators in Zimbabwe, through conferences, workshops, and lectures. I will also work with local organizations to advocate for policy changes that promote access to quality education for all, regardless of socioeconomic status or location. In addition, I will use my knowledge and skills to help develop innovative teaching methods and resources that can be used in local schools.
23/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Antonette, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
23/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sagar: Don’t you agree?
23/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 235 5640: I agree
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I'm wondering why
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

23/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay great hopefully one day will be part of them
23/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sagar: So now Antonette, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I have understood...I wanted to know if the two advanced level passes requirements are which symbols are needed
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - Sagar: The minimum criteria to needed is 2 D's in advanced level exams.
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay
23/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 235 5640: So after sending results that's when I get to know if I have got accepted or not
23/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Then also I would like to know how the fees range if I'm now part of the Edoofa team let's say o got 50% scholarship
23/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: Please be patient Antonette, all your doubts will be cleared after the counselling session by our senior academician Mr.Shubham.
23/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay thank you
23/11/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 235 5640: No they are not
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Oh okay that's better
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 235 5640: So this will per semester or what
23/11/23, 1:31 pm - Sagar: This will be per year.
23/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Sagar: In simple words Antonette, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Can you please explain more about the earn while you learn program
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sagar: Antonette, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay I understand
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 235 5640: I believe that this  will benefit me because it will allow me to develop my skills and knowledge in a practical setting, and it will give me the opportunity to make valuable connections in my chosen field. I also like the focus on turning situations into opportunities, as this is an important skill for any profession <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Antonette, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay that's great
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 235 5640: It's great to know that other students have been able to reduce their expenses through this process
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes, I can definitely see how Edoofa is unique and stands out from other education providers. The Earn While You Learn program is a huge benefit . It's exactly what I've been looking for in an international education program.
23/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: Alright Antonette, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes my family will be a big part of my support system as I pursue education at a higher level
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 235 5640: I have discussed my plans to pursue an international education with my family, but we haven't gone into too much detail about the specifics of the program. I think they would be interested to know about the Edoofa program
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Sagar: Noted Antonette, but I would like you to go through this session and the next part thoroughly with your parents.
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay my mother is already in the group
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: Noted.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I'm ready
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: Antonette as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Uhmm I think it becomes $1500 -$2250
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sagar: Exactly Antonette , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay yeah I think this becomes affordable
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 235 5640: It seems like Edoofa is really trying to make international education more accessible and affordable for students, which is something I really appreciate.
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct, Antonette.
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Antonette basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: However Antonette, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Okay I understand
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 235 5640: No I'm not
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sagar: Alright Antonette, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Yes I now know
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 235 5640: Uhmm no I think I now understand how the program works
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

The way it works is that students complete tasks for businesses or organizations, and they're paid for their work. The tasks could be anything from data entry to market research to customer service. The program helps students to gain experience and earn money while they're in school, which can be really beneficial for their future careers.

It  ensures that the student's seat in the university is reserved for them. The amount of the registration fee is dependent on the university and the scholarship program that the student is enrolled in.
24/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263774784374*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
24/11/23, 4:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263774784374* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Antonette* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then **Antonette's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
24/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: /Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *1st or 2nd of December 2023* for $200 and the *1st or 2nd of January 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *1st or 2nd of December 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
24/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 478 4374: I think the 1st option
24/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263774784374* are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case *@263712355640* gets selected into the program?
