14/10/23, 11:04 am - +265 998 27 29 75: I believe that a paper obtained abroad is different from that obtained here in Malawi in such a way that I will have alot of opportunities to work with different business organization, just like a diploma that Abe a UK board offers is equivalent to the degree offered by Malawi universities
14/10/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: That is correct, and I completely agree with you here
14/10/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

14/10/23, 11:17 am - +265 998 27 29 75: From my research I have discovered that if I study in India I might get a chance to get internship in big companies there and also that the collages can recommend there students in different companies
14/10/23, 11:38 am - Tushti: Very well

14/10/23, 11:45 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Now I know
14/10/23, 11:57 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
14/10/23, 11:58 am - +265 998 27 29 75: No
14/10/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/10/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/10/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: In simple words Bridget, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/10/23, 12:30 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: You mean this is the fee after scholarship
14/10/23, 12:30 pm - Tushti: Yes
14/10/23, 12:31 pm - Tushti: Do you feel this would be affordable for your family?
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I believe so
14/10/23, 12:55 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
14/10/23, 1:01 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Before that, so how are the payment done in terms of duration and the like?
14/10/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: We shall be discussing the same in our next session, dear
14/10/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Bridget, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/10/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/10/23, 3:49 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/10/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/10/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

14/10/23, 3:56 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright
16/10/23, 9:53 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/10/23, 10:01 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Good morning, yes we can
16/10/23, 10:21 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 10:22 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes
16/10/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Bridget, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 10:26 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Range between $1,500-$2,250
16/10/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: Exactly Bridget, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/10/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>

16/10/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/10/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/10/23, 10:30 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Yah I do
16/10/23, 10:31 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/10/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Bridget, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/10/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
16/10/23, 10:37 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes I can
16/10/23, 10:38 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
16/10/23, 10:38 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 10:38 am - Tushti: Alright Bridget, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Malawi itself.
16/10/23, 10:38 am - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
16/10/23, 10:39 am - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/10/23, 10:43 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes
16/10/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/10/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/10/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/10/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
16/10/23, 10:51 am - +265 998 27 29 75: You mean the $500 -$1000 is the one that will be paid 2times
16/10/23, 10:53 am - Tushti: The registration fee would be divided into two installments, so that the family is not burdened into paying te entire amount at once
16/10/23, 10:54 am - Tushti: For eg if the fee is $800, you shall be paying it in two installments of $400 each
16/10/23, 10:54 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Now I get it
16/10/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/10/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*
16/10/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING

Write a short essay in about 500 words 

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

Rwanda, a small East African nation, is a place of complex and painful history. In 1994, the country was engulfed in one of the most horrific genocides the world has ever witnessed. The ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi communities led to the slaughter of nearly a million people in a mere 100 days. Today, 16 years after the genocide, Rwanda is undergoing a remarkable transformation. It has become a symbol of hope, progress, and reconciliation, although it still grapples with the scars of its dark past.

One of the most striking aspects of post-genocide Rwanda is the remarkable economic progress it has made. The government, led by President Paul Kagame, has pursued a policy of rapid economic development. The country's economy has grown steadily, thanks to investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and technology. The capital city, Kigali, boasts of a modern skyline, and the road network connecting various parts of the country has improved significantly. The government's commitment to economic development has led to increased foreign investment, job opportunities, and rising living standards for many Rwandans.

However, the economic prosperity is not evenly distributed. There is still a noticeable wealth gap, with a small elite benefiting from the economic growth while many Rwandans continue to live in poverty. Efforts to bridge this divide are ongoing, but it remains a significant challenge for the nation.

Education has also been a key priority in post-genocide Rwanda. The government has invested heavily in building schools, improving access to education, and increasing the quality of learning. As a result, the literacy rate has increased, and the country is witnessing a generation of educated young people who have the potential to shape Rwanda's future. Education plays a vital role in healing the wounds of the past, as it promotes unity and understanding among different communities.

Reconciliation efforts have been a focal point in Rwanda's journey towards healing. The Gacaca courts, a community-based system of justice, have been instrumental in addressing the crimes committed during the genocide. While they have faced criticism for various reasons, they have played a role in bringing about some closure and helping individuals move forward. The government's emphasis on unity and the eradication of ethnic labels, such as Hutu and Tutsi, is a step toward promoting a unified national identity.

Rwanda's healthcare system has made significant strides as well. The government, in partnership with international organizations, has focused on improving access to healthcare services, reducing maternal and child mortality, and addressing health challenges like HIV/AIDS. These efforts have resulted in a healthier population with an increased life expectancy.

In the realm of politics, Rwanda has seen stability under President Paul Kagame, who has been in power since the end of the genocide. While his leadership has brought about progress, it has also faced scrutiny over issues of democracy and political freedoms. Some argue that political dissent is not well-tolerated, and there is limited room for opposition voices. Balancing stability and political openness remains a challenge for Rwanda.

One notable aspect of post-genocide Rwanda is its commitment to environmental sustainability. The country has made significant efforts in conservation and protecting its rich biodiversity. This includes the protection of endangered mountain gorillas, reforestation projects, and the reduction of plastic waste. These environmental initiatives align with the government's vision for a more sustainable and green Rwanda.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide is marked by remarkable progress and transformation. The nation has come a long way in terms of economic development, education, and healthcare. Reconciliation efforts have contributed to healing, and a strong emphasis on unity has helped bridge ethnic divides. However, challenges persist, including economic inequality, political openness, and the need for further reconciliation. Rwanda's journey serves as a beacon of hope for nations recovering from devastating conflicts, demonstrating that it is possible to rebuild a nation from the darkest of histories and move towards a brighter future.

In my life I've faced many setback events which contributed to life challenging events and difficult decisions about my life, like in 2020 I was involved in a road accident which till date have an effect on my life, I find it difficult to use my left side arm and sometimes I start feeling pain out of no where due to that accident, the other setback is when I discovered that I have ulcers and the other event is the error of Covid 19 is the state where I had to live with fear not only for my life bout also for my family, relatives, friends and everyone I care about. And am just glad that non of my fears come true, here we are happy, healthy and strong, on the ulcers I make sure to eat a proper diet and not stress myself and about my arm I just make sure to not carry heavy things that might trigger the pain. From things that I have gone through in my life they are some that I can't even talk about but in all that I have learnt alot which led to my personal growth and shift in perspective how I look at life and my goal, I told myself to not stress on things that won't take me anywhere and focus on things that will definitely take me somewhere, and with the realization that I can never be the main character in anyone's story but in my own story, this made me to transform to the person am becoming because I know am not there yet.

I believe that everyone out there has a story to tell and maybe some of you are failing to voice out but what I can say is that now is the time to do so if won't do it then nobody else will do it. On top there I reflected on some things that I found hard to overcome in my life but I know people are going through alot than that, all I want is for my dreams to come true create a positive environment for my family, payback to my parents what they have invested in me so far, I want them to look at me and say that our child with happy faces and create a better life for my legacy, with the help of the Lord Almighty in who I believe in I know that I will succeed.

23/11/23, 12:11 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: This time around I will not include the IBAN on the form, it's the Bank's advice saying that now days the IBAN no longer works so instead of sending the money through the account number they bother using the IBAN, so it is not necessary to provide it.
23/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So do you want the Invoice for the $150?
