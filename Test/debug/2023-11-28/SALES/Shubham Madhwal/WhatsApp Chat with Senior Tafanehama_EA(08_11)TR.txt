10/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 880 2346: That's very interested Ms.Tushti
10/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Now I now knowing more about Edoofa
10/11/23, 1:20 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
10/11/23, 1:31 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 880 2346: I think without scholarship we can't afford to study in India but with scholarship we can manage
10/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Yes, sorry for the poor network which affect the conversation
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: In simple words Senior, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/11/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
10/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 880 2346: That's interested. Edoofa scholarships reduced the financial problem to such an extent that almost everyone would manage to pay for studies
10/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Yah sure! You can
10/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Oooh! That's good I understand
10/11/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
10/11/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: Senior, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Edoofa scholarships can reduce the cost of fees in several ways. First, they can cover the cost of tuition, which is one of the largest fees associated with attending college. Second, some scholarships cover the cost of room and board, which can also be a significant expense. Third, some scholarships cover the cost of books and other course materials. Finally, some scholarships also provide a stipend for living expenses, which can help students to offset the cost of fees. All of these factors can add up to a significant reduction in the cost of education. Do you have any other questions about how scholarships can reduce the cost of fees?
Furthermore Edoofa had programs such as EWYL which also helped to lower the price of the fees
10/11/23, 2:24 pm - Tushti: That is correct!
10/11/23, 2:24 pm - Tushti: Can you calculate the answer?
10/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 880 2346: If 1 university ranges from $300-500. 5 universities will cost a range of $1500-$2250
10/11/23, 2:29 pm - Tushti: Exactly Senior, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/11/23, 2:29 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 2:29 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/11/23, 2:29 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Okay Ms.Tushti
10/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Okay okay
10/11/23, 2:32 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/11/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: Senior, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/11/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/11/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
10/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 880 2346: I'm understand Ms.Tushti
10/11/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
10/11/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
10/11/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
10/11/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/11/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 2:41 pm - Tushti: Do answer, dear
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 880 2346: Okay thank you
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/11/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/11/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tuesday at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
10/11/23, 2:48 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

c) Courage and Panic

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?
*What* *is* *the* *life* *in* *Rwanda* *like* *16* *years* *after* *the* *genocide* *there* *?*

 In the years immediately following the genocide in Rwanda, life was extremely difficult for the people of the country. There was widespread poverty, and the country was still reeling from the effects of the genocide. The Rwandan government was faced with the daunting task of rebuilding the country and helping the people to recover from the trauma they had experienced. In addition, there were many challenges related to food security, healthcare, and education. It was a long and difficult process, but over time, the people of Rwanda began to rebuild their lives and their country.

Rwanda was "still reeling from the effects of the genocide", There was trauma of the genocide was still having a major impact on the country and its people. The genocide had a profound psychological impact on the people of Rwanda, and many were struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, the genocide had left the country with a deep sense of distrust and division. It would take many years for the people of Rwanda to begin to heal from the trauma of the genocide and to come together as a nation.

By "widespread poverty", I mean that a large number of people in Rwanda were living in poverty after the genocide. Poverty is defined as a lack of basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, and clean water. In the years immediately following the genocide, many people in Rwanda did not have access to these basic needs. Many people were living in camps for displaced people, and there was a severe shortage of food and clean water. In addition, many people had lost their homes and possessions, and they were struggling to find a way to rebuild their lives.

Rebuilding the country after the genocide was a massive undertaking. It required rebuilding both the physical infrastructure of the country and the social and political systems. The physical infrastructure of the country had been devastated by the genocide, and many roads, bridges, and buildings had been destroyed. The social and political systems were also in a state of disarray, and the government was working to establish a new system of justice and to rebuild trust between different groups of people. It was a slow and difficult process, but over time, the people of Rwanda began to rebuild their country and create a more stable and peaceful society.

Helping the people of Rwanda to recover from the trauma of the genocide was a major challenge. Many people were suffering from PTSD and other mental health issues as a result of the violence they had experienced. In order to help people recover, the government and international organizations implemented a variety of programs, including trauma counseling, psychological first aid, and community-based healing programs. These programs were designed to help people process the trauma they had experienced and to begin to rebuild their lives. They were also designed to promote reconciliation between different groups of people.
Living in refugee camps in Rwanda after the genocide was a difficult and often dangerous experience. The camps were overcrowded and lacked basic resources, and there was a constant risk of disease. Cholera and other waterborne diseases were common, and the camps were also at risk of violence from rival factions. In addition, many people in the camps experienced psychological trauma from the violence they had experienced. The camps were often unsafe, and women and children were particularly vulnerable to violence and sexual assault. Many people in the camps also struggled to find work and to meet their basic needs.

In summary, the long-term effects of the genocide in Rwanda were far-reaching and had a profound impact on the country and its people. The genocide displaced millions of people and led to a massive humanitarian crisis. In the years following the genocide, the country struggled with poverty, disease, and violence, and many people experienced psychological trauma. The rebuilding process was slow and challenging, but the resilience of the people of Rwanda was inspiring. Many people worked tirelessly to rebuild their lives and create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the country.

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"

*My* *inspiration* *story* 

"In a country where the rule of law is often subverted by corruption and violence, one lawyer dared to stand up for what is right. Despite facing great challenges, they persevered and made a significant impact on the lives of those around them. This is the story of Junior Julias a lawyer who studied law in India. Mr Julias inspired me a lot through his good standard of living, to help the less fortunate, desire to make a difference in the world, his legal profession ,desire to see wrong made right and the love of justice.

A desire for justice is often a powerful motivator for people who choose to become lawyers. Seeing injustice in the world can be deeply upsetting, and the idea of being able to do something about it can be incredibly inspiring. For some people, the thought of helping those who have been wronged or protecting the rights of the most vulnerable is what drives them to pursue a career in law. For others, the quest for justice is about upholding the rule of law and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly, regardless of their background or status. Mr Julias was a fair lawyer which inspired me a lot.

The desire for financial security is also a common motivator for people who want to become lawyers. Law school is a significant investment of time and money, and many people hope that becoming a lawyer will lead to a stable and well-paying career. It's true that Mr Julias often earn good salaries, and this can be a powerful incentive for those who come from less privileged backgrounds. For these people, becoming a lawyer is seen as a way to achieve economic security and to create a better life for themselves and their families. So it is arguably that Mr Julia's salary motivated myself to study law.

Helping the less fortunate is a noble goal that can be very motivating for those who are considering a career in law. In many cases, people who have experienced poverty or injustice firsthand are inspired to become lawyers so that they can help others who are in similar situations. For these people, becoming a lawyer is not just about earning a living, but about using their skills and knowledge to make a positive difference in the lives of others.Mr Julias helped the poor in India so he motivated myself because I want to help the poor in Zimbabwe

"In conclusion, the desire to help those who are less fortunate is a major inspiration for many who choose to become lawyers. Whether it's a desire to give back to their community, a passion for social justice, or a simple wish to make a difference in the world, the desire to help others is a powerful motivator for many who enter the legal profession. For these individuals, the law is not just a career, but a way to make a positive impact on the lives of others."

23/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 838 3513: $200 before 28 November and the remaining $150 before 28 December
23/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263786665432 I hope you are clear with the same?
23/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Yes sir we're clear, we already go through it yesterday
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 838 3513: We can use mode 2 sir
23/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also ask your parents to come online!
23/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 838 3513: Okay sir
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 698 8591: Good afternoon everyone
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
