Hope you are well.   Bernadette, your presence has been incredibly meaningful in the Edoofa community I want you to know that I took the time to review your past performance because you've been an exceptional student. You've left a lasting impact on your previous mentors, and I saw your history of the grant performance and it was indeed amazing.  Also, I would like to address the challenges that you are facing regarding the grant.
248 - 20 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Why were you given the grant?*  Bernadette the grant was given to you since you were an exceptionally hard-working student back in Africa so to acknowledge the efforts and discipline you have put into the projects and EWYL Program you were given the grant. Also, God Forbid if in case in any semester you are not able to earn credits to self-finance your education you have a grant amount as a backup for the help, and it doesn't mean that it is a cash reserve for you.
249 - 20 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Aditi Edoofa: *Why is it important to maintain 75% attendance in the sessions, even when you are in India?*  Bernadette, you were supposed to keep on earning the scholarship credits to self-finance your education which is the core of the EWYL Program, please note that the grant isn't cash reserve, it is something that should be maintained. For example, if you win a scholarship, you have to work hard and maintain good grades throughout to retain that scholarship, I hope that you know that if your grades drop your scholarship will be taken away, right? This is a universal example and this is how institutions operate, Bernadette.
250 - 20 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Aditi Edoofa: Bernadette, Mr. Angad personally awarded you the grant because we as a team recognized your exceptional potential as an exceptionally bright student. However, I observed that you haven't attended the sessions or webinars organized to upskill yourself. And there's been a decline in your project involvement since you came to India, which leaves the impression that you haven't put in enough effort to retain the grant given to you.

I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?  Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.  As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?

58 - 18 Dec 2023 09:51AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Faith!  Your EWYL session has already started, and I am waiting for you on your EWYL Line. Kindly join fast!üí°
59 - 20 Dec 2023 01:26PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Faith!  I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?  Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.  As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?

208 - 20 Dec 2023 08:47AM - +263 77 756 9307: Greetings. As the father of Malvern, i have been following your EWYL chats since you started. My belief when i learnt about the program, was it should be on program based activities, hence i thought it should only start when Malvern is India doing the program. But of late, i have noticed that all activities being given to him have nothing to do with his intended program, and as such , its a waste of data. Please remember in Zimbabwe data is too expensive and should be used wisely. There is no way that Malvern can tell his friends, visit headmasters of schools telling them about Eedofa, when he does not at present have full knowledge and does not even know India and the respective universities. So if there is no program related content yet, i advise to stop until Malvern comes to India.
209 - 20 Dec 2023 08:51AM - +263 77 756 9307: This is just a social media chat, is this beneficial to Malvern. Remember you allocate time for him and he schedules this accordingly, leaving all other things. So can you tell me is it benefitial to schedule a program and be asked about celebrating Christmas!!!. Please be serious.
210 - 20 Dec 2023 08:51AM - +263 71 541 5773: Not really into it, I just like it as a holiday
211 - 20 Dec 2023 09:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: Mr. Chikuhwa, I appreciate you being extremely honest and transparent with me. Your concerns may be valid as a parent, however the inference, I am afraid, is not true. The curriculum of the EWYL Program is designed in a way where the culmination of theoretical learning coupled with practical application results in an outcome. The outcome can be learning a 21st-century skill or earning scholarship credits. For example, the explanation of Wednesday Lesson and Saturday Activity that was given to you back in early September might seem something that does not hold significant value at the first go, however, let me tell you that our team spends a lot of time in ensuring that they are jam-packed with employability skills as takeaways. You would be aware that it takes about 10,000 hours for a person to nail a skill and our method of habit creation through the one-on-one personalized mentorship sessions with the student will ensure the outcome.  The projects that I just explained above, teach one the entire spectrum of employability skills - communication, leadership, critical thinking, creative writing, etc. While a student may not understand the objective of the same immediately, it is my job as a mentor to ensure that the student always understands the intentions and outcomes behind any task that is assigned to him/her. These projects will also be pathways for students to earn scholarship credits and be on the way to reducing their tuition fees. I have students who have started earning scholarship credits before they come to India and get their travel/tuition fees paid early on.
212 - 20 Dec 2023 09:32AM - Ananya Edoofa: EWYL Program also consists of the Career Development Cell that you will be soon introduced to. The whole purpose of this team is to hold all the students under the program to be job-ready via training and professional development sessions. CDC also schedules a variety of webinars with industry professionals, leaders, and pioneers of different fields of study across Africa to first hand interact with our students under the EWYL Program.  Having said all of the above, it is your support as a parent that will also carry equal importance in Malvern's EWYL journey, The above reasons are also why students and their parents choose to enroll early into the program so that they can establish a headstart to the EWYL program and stay ahead of their peers. I am sharing a few resources with you, that count as happy testimonials from the students who are part of the program. <This message was edited>

41 - 20 Dec 2023 01:29PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Mthuli!  I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?  Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.  As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
42 - 20 Dec 2023 02:05PM - +263 77 570 3782: Good afternoon, its been a longtime. Mthuli's device is currently having some problems however we will make sure that it's sorted out without delay. I hope that from tomorrow everything will be fine.

I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?  Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.  As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?

With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

212 - 20 Dec 2023 10:02AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

614 - 20 Dec 2023 10:05AM - +260 770170108: THE JOURNEY OF A MASTER PAINTER  Once upon a time in the bustling city of Etherville, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was known throughout the town for her unwavering integrity and diligent work ethic. She possessed a strong sense of honesty and took great pride in completing every task to the best of her ability.  One day, a prestigious art competition was announced, inviting artists from all over the land to showcase their talents. Lily, who had a deep passion for painting, saw this as an opportunity to demonstrate her skills and to inspire others through her art. Excitement filled her heart as she began to prepare for the competition.  With great diligence, Lily spent countless hours refining her technique and experimenting with different styles. She poured her heart and soul into each stroke of the brush, striving for perfection in every detail. Her dedication was unwavering, even when faced with obstacles and self-doubt.  As the day of the competition drew near, Lily unveiled her masterpiece‚Äîa breathtaking painting that depicted the harmony of nature and the resilience of the human spirit. Her artwork radiated with vibrant colors and conveyed a powerful message of hope and perseverance.  On the day of the competition, Lily's painting stood among numerous other magnificent artworks. The judges, renowned art connoisseurs, carefully examined each piece, searching for the one that truly embodied the virtues of integrity and diligence. As they deliberated, whispers filled the room, speculating on the artists behind the masterpieces.  When the time came to announce the winner, the room fell silent. The judges stepped forward, their faces reflecting a mix of awe and admiration. With a profound sense of gravity, they declared, ""The winner of the art competition is Lily, for her incredible painting that beautifully captures the essence of integrity and diligence.""  Tears of joy streamed down Lily's face as she accepted the award. Her hard work and unwavering commitment to her craft had paid off. She had become an inspiration not only to the artists present but to everyone who witnessed her dedication.  Lily's victory served as a reminder that integrity and diligence are not merely abstract concepts, but virtues that can be exemplified through one's actions. Her story spread across the city, inspiring others to embrace these qualities in their own lives.  From that day forward, Lily's artwork became a symbol of the transformative power of integrity and diligence. Her success was a testament to the belief that when one combines their talents with unwavering dedication, they can create something truly extraordinary and inspire others to do the same.  And so, Lily's legacy continued to echo through the ages, reminding generations to come of the virtues that lie within each individual‚Äîvirtues that have the power to shape the world for the better.

Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.  *Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*  *Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Monday and Thursday, from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.* *Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am. *Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please write Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.
241 - 19 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Session Focus:* During our sessions, we discuss project updates, delve into the Wednesday Lesson, and share responses to the Saturday activity. Ensure sharing your understanding and responses before we start our sessions. *Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits. *Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment. *Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.

Your hard work deserves recognition, and I'm here to help you navigate the steps to secure the complete scholarship credits.
481 - 20 Dec 2023 03:37PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that you have submitted the student application forms -  Please make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even what a student goes through in the admission stages.  If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies *you* did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.  To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*.  *Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
482 - 20 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more  Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*

237 - 20 Dec 2023 09:50AM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:  1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

There is no order in which you have to do the project. There is no limit on how much you have to do a project. There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects. It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn. Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.

As we delve into our tasks, let's aim to make a positive impact on each other. Your contributions matter, and together, we can create an environment that radiates positivity.  Excited to collaborate with you all in today's session!
97 - 14 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today without giving me any prior notice. I hope you understand how crucial these sessions are, and it's essential to be consistent in attending them. I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
98 - 19 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Trish and dear parents @263772937423 @263784568322 @263771677900 I hope you are doing well  I am reaching out to you with regard to *Trish's* continuous unavailability and unresponsiveness in our scheduled sessions. These sessions are crucial because students learn important skills like persuasion and communication. They also get the opportunity to work on projects and earn scholarship credits, which can be quite significant.  I've noticed that *Trish* has been missing sessions, and compared to other students, he's falling behind. Some of his peers have already earned $600-$700 in scholarship credits by being regular attendees.  I would like to understand any challenges *Trish* might be facing, and I'm ready to resume his sessions starting tomorrow. Your prompt response would be appreciated.

May the spirit of the season infuse our discussions with joy and camaraderie.  To add a touch of mirth, here's a light-hearted joke: Why did Santa's helper see the doctor? Because he had low ""elf"" esteem! üòÑ  In anticipation of a session adorned with valuable insights and festive charm, let's come together for an enriching experience. I hope the joke did bring a smile to your face. Are you ready for the session?

This form is the one that will be used in applying for universities, colleges or school. It contains information about the student which includes one's goals, achievements and successes and the reason why they are applying
153 - 20 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
154 - 20 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
155 - 20 Dec 2023 01:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
156 - 20 Dec 2023 01:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

104 - 20 Dec 2023 02:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
105 - 20 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.

108 - 20 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-  1) What‚Äôs your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter? 3) You‚Äôll also notice the ‚ÄòRegistration Fee‚Äô mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you‚Äôre supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
109 - 20 Dec 2023 03:41PM - +263 78 057 5394: Tuition fee is $1 200 annual Accomodation is also $1 200 Then the registration fee is $750 which will be reduced to $650 due to endowment plan
110 - 20 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.  In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates. <This message was edited>

112 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200.  The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
113 - 20 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship.  This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?

Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

122 - 20 Dec 2023 07:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions.

It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
124 - 20 Dec 2023 07:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation.

Civil law is  quite different from criminal law . lam more interested in  civil law as it covers a wide range of non criminal disputes which include contract disputes, property disputes , personal injury claims and many more. They are many reasons as to why lam more interested in civil law and the reasons include ,civil law  typically offers a great chance of monetary compensation compared to criminal law and by any chance if l win a   civil case you might end up being awarded with money to compensate for your losses , secondly civil cases are less time consuming as they are resolved faster compared to criminal cases , thirdly civil cases are typically less emotional draining comparing with criminal cases and as for me l do not like  to be emotionally drained  with cases

Firstly l have good communication skills because a lawyer has to be a good communicartor both verbally and in writing , for instance  if a lawyer has all the evidence needed but cannot  communicate well the chances of winning a case becomes low . Furthermore l possess the skills of problem solving and critical thinking , l think this skill is important as a lawyer sometimes deals with tricky cases and inorder to win the case one has to be a critical thinker and l also have the ability to think out of the box . In addition l also have strong research skills and l can even work under pressure and also lam a very organized person. Most importantly l have a passion for justice and lam committed in helping others.

152 - 20 Dec 2023 07:53PM - +263 77 274 5128: Noted with thanks
153 - 20 Dec 2023 08:04PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
154 - 20 Dec 2023 08:07PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes that is accurate
155 - 20 Dec 2023 08:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
158 - 20 Dec 2023 08:10PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes lam
159 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.  *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
160 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
161 - 20 Dec 2023 08:19PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
162 - 20 Dec 2023 08:37PM - +263 78 948 9559: Yes we do wish to have that
163 - 20 Dec 2023 08:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos.  *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
150 - 20 Dec 2023 07:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
151 - 20 Dec 2023 07:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
152 - 20 Dec 2023 07:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
153 - 20 Dec 2023 07:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?",No,Yes,N,,

167 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
168 - 20 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
169 - 20 Dec 2023 08:29PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I do agree
170 - 20 Dec 2023 08:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.  However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?

155 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
156 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
157 - 20 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
158 - 20 Dec 2023 07:50PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir you can elaborate further
159 - 20 Dec 2023 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.  *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
154 - 20 Dec 2023 07:21PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct

160 - 20 Dec 2023 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.  *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.  Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?

48 - 20 Dec 2023 09:21AM - Garima Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

121 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
122 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
123 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
124 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
125 - 20 Dec 2023 11:25AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
172 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
173 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
174 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
175 - 20 Dec 2023 03:54PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
176 - 20 Dec 2023 03:56PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes that's it
177 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Gurvinder: Alright Birthwell, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
178 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes
179 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
180 - 20 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +263 73 815 1871: No not yet but we are planning to discuss it
181 - 20 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
190 - 20 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
191 - 20 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Gurvinder: Birthwell basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
192 - 20 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
193 - 20 Dec 2023 04:47PM - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
194 - 20 Dec 2023 07:05PM - +263 73 815 1871: The network here is bad

29 - 20 Dec 2023 09:11AM - +260 97 7693941: Goodmorning!
30 - 20 Dec 2023 09:35AM - Gurvinder: Please address this.
31 - 20 Dec 2023 09:58AM - +260 97 7693941: Indeed.  As the mother  to charity,  I would  certainly  like  this  for my daughter  .
32 - 20 Dec 2023 10:33AM - +260 97 7693941: It would  really help  us financially considering  that my husband  has be a kidney  patient  for some time now and it has affected  our financial  stability.
33 - 20 Dec 2023 11:24AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Mulonda, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
34 - 20 Dec 2023 12:06PM - +260 97 7693941: Well! I would  have loved  my daughter  to get the scholarship but  after  reading this  I don't seem  to qualify because  I've  not been  consistent  on the counselling  stage due to circumstances  beyond  my control  and the other  reason  is that am not home with my family for them to be present throughout  the counseling and eligibility process.  So with this in mind, I don't know how Edoofa could be of help in this kind of  a scenario. <This message was edited>

41 - 20 Dec 2023 03:05PM - +260 97 7693941: For  architecture, she said  she  loves  drawing and coming up with designs  of different  shapes,  for law it's because  she enjoys  watching  court  proceedings on TV shows and that how she  thinks of doing law one day. For pharmacy  it's  because  her aunty is a pharmacist  that's  where she gets the inspiration.

50 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - +260 97 7693941: I can add someone from home yes,  but the problem  will be network  ! We leave  in an area which  has very poor mobile network  services and to get a message  over is quite  a struggle. So having  said this I think we end the chat here cause I think I won't manage to get all the necessary  information  that you might need.  Thankyou for your time.

58 - 20 Dec 2023 12:30PM - +263 77 229 7975: Thank you so much Sir. I am honoured to be part of this group.
59 - 20 Dec 2023 01:30PM - +263 71 597 4800: -A first born of two boys, left at 13 by the unfortunate life tragedy when my father passed away, I have a passion for planes. My mother who has only a decent O level education doesn't have any stable career but rather does a lot of things to keep us afloat, from buying and selling maize, poultry though not a constant business and she's a part time domestic worker - I have graduated from A level in 2021 - I want to pursue in aerospace engineering - I was supported by Makomborero to pursue A level and O level by my late grandfather and after him my late step father. - I do not have Mr and Mrs Chipare said they would provide support on my journey. -  My brother, is about to get into A level. - I studied at Kenzim College, here in Harare province, my fees , which changed every term were around $300 USD
60 - 20 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +263 71 597 4800: I thrive to be ever growing and always better than the person I currently am , because there is always room for improvement. I strongly believe that the more im competent the better I can positively contribute the the world
61 - 20 Dec 2023 01:52PM - Gurvinder: So May I know what were you studying in Kenzim College?
62 - 20 Dec 2023 01:54PM - +263 71 597 4800: I was studying sciences, Maths, physics , chemistry and statistics
63 - 20 Dec 2023 02:05PM - Gurvinder: Please, I mean you were studying A- level?
64 - 20 Dec 2023 02:06PM - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , i was studying A level
65 - 20 Dec 2023 02:11PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
72 - 20 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study aerospace engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
73 - 20 Dec 2023 03:15PM - +263 71 597 4800: -So, I started form three at Kenzim from 2018, wrote my O level finals there and then did A level untill final as well in 2021 - From form 1, I was in Buhera at St Moses the prophet secondary up to 2017, then after my grandfather died I moved here in Harare
74 - 20 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
75 - 20 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Gurvinder: Please address this.
76 - 20 Dec 2023 03:49PM - +263 71 597 4800: It wasn't always what I thought, I wanted to be a pilot and I loved physics ever since I got introduced to it, when I got to A level it was the only thing that was challenging enough. So my accounts teacher , who always encouraged and believed in me asked me what I wanted to do now that I am about to complete A level, my answer was to be a pilot. He told me that was going to be not big enough compared to what I could do with my A level. I thought I love planes , why don't I build them. I had a dream to one day land with a giant plane, just as a surprise ,in my grandfather's field in the rurals. It even got better to build something that I may or may not fly, but certainly love, which is challenging enough.
77 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Gurvinder: It's amazing how your passion for planes and physics led you to consider a career in aeronautical engineering or aircraft design. Sometimes, unexpected guidance or suggestions can open up new perspectives, redirecting us towards paths that resonate even more with our capabilities and aspirations.
78 - 20 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
79 - 20 Dec 2023 04:18PM - +263 71 597 4800: No, not one.
80 - 20 Dec 2023 04:30PM - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
81 - 20 Dec 2023 04:39PM - +263 71 597 4800: <Media omitted>
104 - 20 Dec 2023 05:19PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa‚Äôs Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
105 - 20 Dec 2023 05:42PM - +263 71 597 4800: I see myself as an innovative aerospace engineer growing in my career and seizing every opportunity to be better. Bringing new ideas into the field. Building amazing teams and bringing the best of ideas  into the world. And what I really care about the most is making a positive net contribution. I see myself influencing young minds of that time to do great things despite their backgrounds.
106 - 20 Dec 2023 06:00PM - +263 71 597 4800: It's not very easy for me to pursue a tertiary education given my family's circumstances, so an opportunity with edoofa is a big positive, given that it's an experience of living and learning abroad with an opportunity to work. It is all an opportunity to grow and certainly having other students who are like me is a connecting point for lasting relations and connections which are meaningful. As well as the leadership of edoofa means proper guidance in terms of career development and opportunities to develop the leadership muscle inside me I believe
107 - 20 Dec 2023 06:32PM - +263 71 597 4800: As for confidence about achieving above 2 points Mr Gurvinder, I have passed my A levels
108 - 20 Dec 2023 06:41PM - +263 71 597 4800: <Media omitted>

32 - 20 Dec 2023 09:36AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
33 - 20 Dec 2023 09:37AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
34 - 20 Dec 2023 09:37AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
35 - 20 Dec 2023 09:37AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?",No,No,N,,

This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring.

The economy of a country is one major thing a country realises on and with a dead economy in Rwanda it is easy for one to say that these people may have had serious cases of people starving to death.  Not only the economy was damaged but the facilities in Rwanda these people had to rebuild their country all over again and with a dead economy it was hard for them to have to get raw material imported into their country  In conclusion one may say Rwanda had it really bad and it took a lot for them to be where they're today.  *My inspiration story*  Well when it comes to being inspired I take it from the people I live with both at home and in my community..... Growing up in a country like Zimbabwe is not an easy thing honestly but everyday when we wake up and try building a name for ourselves we are told to go out there and show them who we are and what we are made of those words alone can make a child want to do more and be better than they were yesterday......yes we have people like Ellon Masks and Bill Gates who have inspired almost half of the world into working hard but I personally got my inspiration from my people,my grandma alway says ""learn and be someone in life and take good care of us when you are older""hearing those words from an old lady who has ran her race for a long tym now helps remind me that I can be better and I can become better than I was a few days ago or even a few seconds ago..

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas.

A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.

138 - 20 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
139 - 20 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
140 - 20 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

146 - 20 Dec 2023 01:39PM - Gurvinder: Farai, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

26 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29 - 20 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

33 - 20 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Fumani, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

78 - 20 Dec 2023 05:00PM - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are: *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates. *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client‚Äôs perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court. *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor. *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job. *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding. A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

69 - 20 Dec 2023 03:05PM - +260 96 5422579: In Five years after studying B.com I also see myself as being an integral part of society and being able to contribute to the growth and marketing business at large. I am positive and determined that with Edoofa ,I would be dedicated to my school profession and deliver the best while learning from the best.Having said that I see myself demonstrating my leadership skills
70 - 20 Dec 2023 03:14PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Kasonde I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
71 - 20 Dec 2023 03:17PM - +260 96 5422579: Yes I am
72 - 20 Dec 2023 03:29PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
73 - 20 Dec 2023 03:49PM - +260 96 5422579: I would prefer studying abroad because I feel I would have a greater exposure to technology and equipment needed for me to study.And this will also help me to interact with people of different cultures
74 - 20 Dec 2023 04:05PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
75 - 20 Dec 2023 04:28PM - +260 96 5422579: With the knowledge and and skills I would obtain from learning abroad I would use that as a key to contribute to the growth of the education system.
76 - 20 Dec 2023 04:33PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Kasonde, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
77 - 20 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +260 96 5422579: I agree
78 - 20 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
111 - 20 Dec 2023 05:07PM - +260 96 5422579: Okay Notted
112 - 20 Dec 2023 05:10PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
113 - 20 Dec 2023 05:10PM - +260 96 5422579: Yes please
114 - 20 Dec 2023 05:12PM - Gurvinder: Kasonde, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in. <This message was edited>

79 - 20 Dec 2023 03:58PM - +260 767735131: Thank you so much, so according to what I had said earlier about journalism not being common in Zambia, I feel in five years time after doing the course, I could easily get a job and since it deals with the media people would easily be communicated to about it and take keen interest in it and also be encouraged to do the same course. Me getting into the Edoofa's program can really help me both financially and academically because I would not have to wait for my parents to first find money to enroll me into tertiary education but instead Edoofa can and that can be an achievement on its own. Secondly, in accordance to the course I've chosen which is journalism and mass communication, the Edoofa program can be the first thing I can want to talk about seeing that I can be dealing with the media and communication and lastly this can really help me achieve my dreams seeing that I have become what I've always wanted to.

84 - 20 Dec 2023 04:46PM - +260 767735131: With the course I want to do I feel its not taken that much serious in Zambia like I said earlier and I feel they don't Carter everything

I learnt that Edoofar program is a scholarship initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions, i was further told that it covers 50-100% tutution fees. I also learnt that the program works closely with local ambassadors for more clarity....Furthermore, l was l also advised about the program of Earn While You Learn whereby a student will be enhancing his or her skills on the field of study
12 - 20 Dec 2023 02:21PM - +263 77 138 2796: Further on the issue of EWYL program, l also learnt that it helps students earn credits to fund their higher education
16 - 20 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

17 - 20 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you so much very clear
19 - 20 Dec 2023 02:44PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Member, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 20 Dec 2023 02:49PM - +263 77 138 2796: Thank you...yes l think l have what it takes to meet these 2 significant metrics
21 - 20 Dec 2023 03:05PM - Gurvinder: Now Member, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

199 - 20 Dec 2023 09:43AM - Gurvinder: Molline, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
200 - 20 Dec 2023 09:44AM - +263 78 698 8605: Ohhhhh okay
201 - 20 Dec 2023 09:45AM - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact figure.

As weird and  bad looking of the name of the village , the village is just like it , it is an eyesore.  From that eyesore village, originated me a person who is willing to make something in life. My dream started in a way nobody could imagine . In a brief we can just say a well wisher who helped some orphan  kids of my community was and is still my motive.  In the course of helping those kids he got to a point he narrated his life story to the people. In the narration he mentioned he started like me living a low life in a neglected-like village with his grandparents. He had to walk a very long distance to school and sometimes get fired from school because he had not paid school fees. To counter that problem he had to do some piece jobs while going to school . From his explanation you could tell on your own that life was not a smooth flow for that person but he still made it in life .  That gave me courage and strength that I would make it. To be honest hope was not anywhere to be found that time because my parents were not yet employed and the jobs were not easy get. Getting a job was difficult ,morelike cutting an ignite rock with a nail cutter.  So I had to strive my primary school reading and studying very hard going to school not to waste any time , trying to utilize every dollar my parents had paid school fees because I knew they had not earn that money easily .  It was then when I was about to enter secondary school ( high school) my parents got lucky or I should say by God's mercy they got employed in the Ministry of education . They managed to keep sending me to school but it was hard and it is still hard for I am not the only kid in my family who need to go to school . My siblings also need that privilege so that made me consider looking for assistance in form scholarships and well-wishers like I am doing now. This will help me achieve my dream and reduce the burden of school fees from my parents. Not forgetting the motive from the well wisher , I want to be successful in life so that my kids and my circle of influence will not suffer the same problems I suffered that time .  That made me who I am now . Aiming to achieve something in life . Who knows maybe one day , I will be one person's motive as well. <This message was edited>

103 - 20 Dec 2023 01:02PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

110 - 20 Dec 2023 02:00PM - Gurvinder: Nicole, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

121 - 20 Dec 2023 12:16PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ntali, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

122 - 20 Dec 2023 12:18PM - +260 97 9151577: yes sir I agree and working hard will give me that reputation achieved by competing to be the best

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
176 - 20 Dec 2023 03:34PM - +260 97 9151577: yes I think it will benefit me in the best way like pushing me to work hard each time I'm doing work .I think this program will give me exposure to the outside world and it will help me interact and learn from others
177 - 20 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ntali, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
178 - 20 Dec 2023 03:42PM - +260 97 9151577: okay so all the money I earn goes into my fees

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
16 - 20 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17 - 20 Dec 2023 02:42PM - +263 78 529 0151: Yaa true
18 - 20 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Makamure, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.  The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.  However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court. *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor. *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job. *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
87 - 20 Dec 2023 09:23AM - +263 77 571 3785: If I were given the opportunity to study abroad through this scholarship, I would aim to contribute my learnings in several ways. Firstly, I would aim to share my experiences and knowledge with my peers in my home country. I would want to help them understand the different education systems and how they can benefit from learning from other countries. Secondly, I would also want to help create better educational opportunities for others in my home country. This could involve working with local organizations or institutions to improve the quality of education and create more opportunities for students. Overall, I would aim to use my experiences to make a positive impact on the education system in my home.

Don‚Äôt you agree?

118 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
119 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
120 - 20 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

172 - 20 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
173 - 20 Dec 2023 04:04PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes, and this is something I have been looking for
174 - 20 Dec 2023 04:21PM - Gurvinder: Alright Tawananyasha, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
175 - 20 Dec 2023 04:24PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes, they are the ones who will be supporting me.
176 - 20 Dec 2023 04:32PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
177 - 20 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes
178 - 20 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?",No,Yes,N,,

18 - 20 Dec 2023 09:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: Charmaine is lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of her friend *Persistance* who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Did her friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer?
19 - 20 Dec 2023 09:16AM - +263 77 340 4312: Not in detail, but l would love to hear from you thank you.
20 - 20 Dec 2023 09:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Charity, Please let me share some information with you.
21 - 20 Dec 2023 09:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
97 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
98 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
99 - 20 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
100 - 20 Dec 2023 02:46PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.    *So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
101 - 20 Dec 2023 07:27PM - +263 78 635 4785: yes very much affordable thank you
102 - 20 Dec 2023 08:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.",No,No,N,,

However please Note by Tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.

Earning while learning
110 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

116 - 20 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,No,N,,

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,Yes,N,,

20 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.
21 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22 - 20 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic‚Äôs Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David‚Äôs Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony‚Äôs, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years.    The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.  *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*

64 - 20 Dec 2023 01:10PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, I just had a discussion with our team and the course is currently unavailable, the only option for you in the Medical field of Diploma would be a Diploma in Medical Lab Technology.

67 - 20 Dec 2023 02:20PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, I will be guiding regarding the same in the further session.
68 - 20 Dec 2023 02:21PM - Pallika Edoofa: Firstly, I would like to know if you want to continue with this course?
103 - 20 Dec 2023 04:14PM - +263 71 915 0476: I think it is a perfect opportunity. Yes, l think l would benefit from this program
104 - 20 Dec 2023 04:15PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
105 - 20 Dec 2023 04:16PM - +263 71 915 0476: Yes, l do understand
106 - 20 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: Shawn, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
107 - 20 Dec 2023 04:23PM - +263 71 915 0476: I like point number 2 Affordability
108 - 20 Dec 2023 05:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: Great!  Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

Can you please tell me: *1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?* *2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kelvin ?*
24 - 20 Dec 2023 09:17AM - +263 78 195 0427: 1)Well what motivated me to apply for the schoolarship program firstly was the Edoofa schoolarship program covering 50-80% of all expenses for my stay and learning in Indian and secondly quality education that statistics has shown is very high in India with a lot of diverse opportunities for success and lastly am a huge fan of the Indian culture and traditions so this came as an opportunity for me to learn more about the nation  2)*The Edoofa Scholarship Program*  ‚ñ´Ô∏èThe Edoofa Scholarship Program is a transformative initiative aimed at providing *Quality International Tertiary* Education to deserving students, particularly from Africa. ‚ñ´Ô∏èManaged by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* Pvt. Ltd. founded by *Mr.Angad and Mr.Avreen Singh* , the program addresses the challenges of both *affordability* and *employability* that many students face in pursuing tertiary education. ‚Ä¢Key Features of the Edoofa Scholarship Program  ‚Ä¢Imagine having the opportunity to pursue your dream education without the burden of very high tuition fees. ‚Ä¢Edoofa provides scholarships covering 50-80% of tuition costs, ensuring that financial constraints don't stand between you and a Quality International Education. Studying in India without the scholarship granted by Edoofa is way too expensive and may cost around $7000-$8000 per year But once I saw that with the Edoofa schoolarship program I would need a range of *$2000-$3000* per year including all academic and living expenses. ‚Ä¢Through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa gives you the opportunity to alleviate the financial burden even more, by participating in online projects and earning scholarship credits <This message was edited>",No,No,N,,

61 - 20 Dec 2023 09:01AM - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering Tatenda's subjects, interests, and passion, Tatenda is eligible to pursue   *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)*    Do you want me to explain the course in depth?

63 - 20 Dec 2023 11:27AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)* is a 3-year duration undergraduate program for students who wish to pursue their career in Journalism and media industry.  The Career Options and Job opportunities are very high with the media sector. A student who has completed B.J.M.C can work with the news channels, news magazines, publication houses, Media is a connection between the population and the world.

87 - 20 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
88 - 20 Dec 2023 04:12PM - +263 77 352 3598: Its ok
89 - 20 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Beatrice, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

651 - 20 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Sahil Edoofa: Raymond, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?

We had a long counseling session with the whole family while trying to stabilize the impact of crushed dreams, not only in relation to Stacey's future education but that of her siblings as well, all as a result from the employer's actions. Admittedly Edoofa had provided an excellent opportunity for our daughter's progression but it is a hard decision to any father to choose to abandon it at such a crucial point.  I'm sure you appreciate the situation that he finds himself in and support him in wishing him a good recovery prospect which will see him realizing his dreams of seeing his daughter come out better, which we believe will come about still
