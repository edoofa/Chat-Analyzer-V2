Our first batch of 2023 students arrived yesterday morning, and it has been an incredibly busy and overwhelming experience. Meeting these new students for the first time was beyond words, I cannot describe the feeling adequately. I'm now even more thrilled to meet you too! Don't forget to watch the video I'm sharing below; it captures the excitement and enthusiasm we're all experiencing!🌻

01/08/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Ok i will try that one
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, My Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?
02/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Greetings t yes i am ready for the session
02/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
02/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 565 4624: I don't understand i would appreciate it if you explain
02/08/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
02/08/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
02/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Thanks for the explanation ma'am
02/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
02/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 565 4624: I have finished reading ma'am
02/08/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
02/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Great. Greetings to them
02/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
02/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

03/08/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
03/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Yes ma'am it is a great deal
03/08/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
18/09/23, 8:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
20/10/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Parents @263772580927 @263715654624 

Our records show that Munashe has not attended sessions for more than 20 days now. This message serves as an *official notice* from the academic board that prolonged absence from the program may result in the *revocation* of your child's participation in the EWYL program. I sincerely hope to avoid such a situation.

If you are facing any challenges or if any concerns have led to this absence, I urge you to share it with me so that we can have a conversation about it and provide the necessary support.
20/12/23, 9:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772580927 @263715654624 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. I think we should connect today and discuss if something is there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. What do you think?
