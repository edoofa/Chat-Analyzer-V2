23/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
23/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 275 5936: Yes Mam it will be a rewarding experience working with me.
23/08/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure Natalie, without any doubt🌟
23/08/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 275 5936: The other person who joined this group is my mother Mrs Patuma Fletcher she is willing to help me with my dream of studying abroad.
23/08/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome her to the group, I am sure you will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
23/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 275 5936: I hope so Mam.
23/08/23, 8:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Natalie, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 275 5936: My long term goals are to be come  a successful student in my studies having a positive impact of changing my family background, my society, my country and the world at large so that life will be easier for all of the people around the world.

EWYL Program will help me to achieve my dreams by making education affordable and get maximum credits so that my parents will not have stress during my studies.
23/08/23, 9:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear about that and I am sure that together we will be an amazing team and achieve all these targets🎯
23/08/23, 9:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 275 5936: No Mam what are the objectives?
23/08/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 275 5936: Oky thank you, l have understood more.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 275 5936: I have read it.
23/08/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped from the mail?
23/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 275 5936: I have seen that the student was happy and very much grateful that the EWYL team helped him to get maximum credits and he also gained some skills.

So l have seen that while being helped by my mentor l will also gain some skills.
23/08/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
23/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 275 5936: Thank you Mam.

Let me share about myself…
24/08/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
24/08/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 275 5936: Nice to know you Ms Saloni, l had no problem while viewing the video.
24/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Natalie, I am glad to hear that.
24/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 275 5936: Thank you Ms Saloni for the news l have read them.
24/08/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 275 5936: For sure every section of the newsletter has got its taste and interest,but l have liked the section of 3 Quotes because they have motivated me .
24/08/23, 10:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
25/08/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 275 5936: Good Morning Ms Saloni.

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 275 5936: Thank you Ms Saloni, my parents can complete this session if am not available.
21/09/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

07/10/23, 8:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Natalie will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

07/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 71 275 5936: You once sent this document to us and we read it through.
07/10/23, 8:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Natalie can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 275 5936: Yes we are on the same page.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 275 5936: Oky Mam l understand.
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: We have to do some basic formalities.
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth is our priority right.
23/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 275 5936: Oky thank you Mam.

As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
