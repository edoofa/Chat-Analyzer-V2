The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

20/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 769913251: My name is Faith Chama, and I was a student at Dominican Convent Secondary School. I am writing to provide you with a formal introduction and to share some information about my educational background, achievements, and interests as requested.
I am currently enrolled in grade 12 at Dominican Convent Secondary School, where I had a bit of some challenges with having a strong academic record but eventually became better and consistent. I am dedicated to my studies and have a passion for learning, which has been reflected in my academic performance.
Throughout my school years, I have actively participated in various extracurricular activities, including netball, swimming and performing arts. These experiences have helped me develop skills in leadership, teamwork, and time management, which I believe are invaluable for my personal and academic growth.
After initially aspiring to pursue a career in aviation, I have conscientiously reevaluated my ambitions and have chosen to focus on architectural engineering. This decision stems from a careful consideration of the opportunities and challenges associated with both fields, leading me to recognize the alignment of my skills and interests with the dynamic and diverse realm of architectural engineering. I am eager to immerse myself in this discipline and am committed to leveraging my strengths to build a meaningful and impactful career in this field.
I am grateful for the opportunity to engage with you and to receive support as I navigate the next steps in my academic journey. I am eager to gain insights and advice that will help me make informed decisions about my future educational and career endeavors.
Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better, and I look forward to the prospect of working together as I pursue my educational and personal development.
20/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your dedication to both your professional career and your passion for farming showcases a well-rounded individual with a diverse set of skills, Mr. Peros. As a Payroll Officer with a diploma in IT and a qualified ZiCA accountant, your expertise in financial matters is undoubtedly commendable. The fact that you engage in farming, not just as an activity but as a passion, adds a layer of commitment and resilience! Moreover, your motivation to support Faith's education reflects your vision for her success and your belief in the transformative power of education. Your aspiration to see her become an impactful force in her career and an inspiration to other girls is truly admirable. I have confidence that Faith is an exceptionally diligent student, and she will undoubtedly demonstrate her capabilities if given the right guidance!
20/12/23, 1:26 pm - +260 96 9559186: Definitely 💯
