I was doing *Mathematics Chemistry & Biology*
And had hopes of starting *Physics* this year and writing it in June..

But due to financially crippling situation I was only able to write *2 subjects, Math & Chem*
That it to say, I am awaiting results for those those 2 subjects

20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Thank you very much..
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Currently, I mostly live with relatives but my mother has a house in Harare. Just before the time the exam fee was announced my mother didn’t have the money and she made a decision that wasn’t easy to sell the house, she figured the money would go a long way besides my exam fee. She received the downpayment for the house and within the same week, as if fate were against it, she got robbed of all the money and injured to a very saddening state..

A few weeks later the exam fee was announced, we couldn make the due date. The people who had bought the house started giving excuses and we eventually lost hope in them. The only reason i was able to register was because of the late registration extension and we were barely able to afford to register those 2 subjects..
20/12/23, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about the challenging circumstances you and your family are facing, Tatenda. Facing such adversities requires great strength, and I commend you and your family for navigating through these challenges.

20/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
20/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 977 5216: My mother will, the situation is more or less stabled..
And from what I understand, the Edoofa programs assists candidates with finding part time jobs to pay off the rest of their financial needs.. or is that no longer the case?..
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that we offer a distinctive program that allows students to engage in internships and self-finance a significant part of their fees while completing their coursework. I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
