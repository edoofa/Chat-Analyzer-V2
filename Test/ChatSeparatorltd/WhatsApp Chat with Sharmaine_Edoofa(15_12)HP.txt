18/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 135 5910: Good morning

You appeared your A level exams this year?
18/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you very much

Yes
18/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 71 135 5910: Morning how are you
Yes we can proceed
18/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please.
18/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
18/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Well Sharmaine now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yes I do believe it's a life changing decision, as it open doors and opportunities for one to fulfill his or her dreams
18/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Very correct Sharmaine.

In that case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
18/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you
Yeah, I can surely say I'm mentally prepared for such a life
18/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful.
18/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 135 5910: Noted, yeah I have faith that I will make it
18/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: That's great
18/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
18/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 135 5910: Ok
18/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 135 5910: OK at O level I had 9 subjects out of 10 and at A level I was doing Literature in English, History and Family and religious studies.
My Main motive to study Law is that one day I wanna stand up for people who are oppressed and today many people are prisoned without trials and sometimes due to corruption hence I want to help such people
18/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Well received, Sharmaine.

That's surely well thought off!

I can see you have inclination towards doing good for others and to prevail justice! I appreciate your thoughts. 

So on that note, let me first brief you about your desired course.
18/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you very much

18/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

18/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Sharmaine, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
18/12/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

20/12/23, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

20/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 135 5910: Good morning everyone
20/12/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the delay since Monday, Sharmaine?
20/12/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
20/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 135 5910: Sorry it's due to poor network connections
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: I understand.
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the discussion?
20/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yes I did
20/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you for understanding
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Alright, and what are your thoughts on the same?
20/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 135 5910: I think it's good as you reduce the costs
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Alright please
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Sharmaine, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yes I do agree with you
20/12/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India? <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yes I now understand
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

20/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 135 5910: Ok
20/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

20/12/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please
20/12/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 845 9792: Quite remarkable
20/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
20/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yes
20/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Sharmaine, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 135 5910: $ 1500_$2 250
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 135 5910: OK and that will help a lot
20/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 135 5910: Ok
20/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 135 5910: I think it's good as it helps to reduce many cost
20/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Did you follow the same please?
20/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 135 5910: I'm still reading
20/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Sure please
20/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 135 5910: I'm done, thank you
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: That's good
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 135 5910: Noted
20/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 135 5910: Yeah, I understand
20/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
20/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 135 5910: Ok
20/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

20/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Surely
20/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Sharmaine.
20/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 135 5910: Ok
20/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

20/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Dear Sharmaine,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “21-12-23” at 9 AM. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
20/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 135 5910: Thank you very much Ms Harmehak
