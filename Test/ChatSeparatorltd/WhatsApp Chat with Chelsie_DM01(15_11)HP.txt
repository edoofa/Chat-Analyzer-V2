16/11/23, 9:15 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/11/23, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 289 2997: Even myself, I appreciate this EDOOFA  scholarship. I will be happy if you consider my child. Especially the 100% scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: We shall surely discuss please.
16/11/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Memory, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Tawanda better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
16/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 289 2997: I Memory Musonza did a panel beating course at Harare politechnic. Right now I'm working as A panel beater at Magtime time panel beaters. Her Chelsie being very brilliant at school motivates me to support her for her education
16/11/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Memory, Its a pleasure to know about you and Chelsie!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself.

May I know about Mr Tawanda please?
16/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 289 2997: Tawanda did ordinary level. He is an assistant plumber
16/11/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Its a pleasure to know about him please.
16/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 289 2997: My pleasure too.
16/11/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Mrs Memory, as we move ahead,

I would like to know Chelsie better as a student, how she is at school, her interests and hobbies please?
16/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 289 2997: Chelsie is very good at school. Again she is well displined. She loves to play handball and cooking
16/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: That's great,

It's a pleasure to know about her Mrs Memory!

May I know the subjects she is currently pursuing at Daramombe high?
16/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 289 2997: Maths, business studies and computer science
16/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Mrs Memory!
16/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I am please
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: That's amazing
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: So what exactly would Chelsie like to pursue, Mrs Memory?
16/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 289 2997: Supply chain and management or bachelor of science with computing and finance or accounting

16/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 289 2997: Well India is very rich in education. I wish you can consider Chelsie.
16/11/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

We surely look forward to the same.
16/11/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 289 2997: No one has an idea
16/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
16/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 289 2997: Is all the fees included in the $2000 - $3000 range
16/11/23, 11:53 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Memory, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1500-$2000*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

Isn't that exciting?
16/11/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 289 2997: Very exciting indeed
16/11/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Memory, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
16/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 289 2997: Very true here things are very challenging.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Memory!

So given the costs are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
16/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes EDOOFA makes education very affordable. I would also like to know what kind of jobs involved in the earn to learn program
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 289 2997: I understood. Thank you so
16/11/23, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
16/11/23, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 289 2997: OK. I understood. Thank you
16/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: That is great, so far are there any queries please?
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 289 2997: No queries
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, 

Mrs Memory, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I'm ready
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Memory, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 289 2997: The student will spend upto $1500-$2250
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yaaa I think so
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 289 2997: OK. Nice. Very encouraging
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Mrs Memory.
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I understood
16/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 289 2997: I'm interested please.
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great, I do wish you look. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Thank you. I will get in touch with her
16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Mrs Memory
16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

17/11/23, 12:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
17/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Good morning. Yes let us procceed
17/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
17/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 289 2997: It went well. I understand everything
17/11/23, 2:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
17/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 289 2997: I will get in contact with her as soon as possible.
17/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you know 12 students already have reserved the scholarship seat from Daramombe High for their higher education through the Edoofa Program. 

1. Rufaro Princess Musarurwa
2. Musengeyi Precious R
3. Kimberly Hunda
4. Tadiwanashe Walter Nyika
5. Lindsey Mahwaya
6. Nhende Kuvimbanashe Angel
7. Chido Maposa
8. Takudzwa Mupereri
9. Panashe Nedziwe
10. Clarisy Nyamhunga
11. Anesu Kagowa
12. Mvududu Lilian
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 289 2997: That's very good. I wish my child wil be considered by Edoofa
17/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 289 2997: My netwek is very slow this side
17/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?
7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 289 2997: The course is Bachelor in Business Administration.
The average cost of studies without a scholarship in India is $8000.
If found eligible for the program I will pay $2000-$3000 annually
The enrolment fee is $350 and it must be paid within 7 days.
17/11/23, 4:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you ready for the same ?
17/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 289 2997: I can not afford without a Scholarship.
17/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 289 2997: But with the scholarship I can pay
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 5:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd November 2023 for $200 and the 22nd or 23rd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
17/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 289 2997: I will prefer the $200 in 7days and the$150 in 30days.
17/11/23, 6:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please can you answer using voice notes.
17/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 289 2997: <Media omitted>

20/11/23, 8:12 am - +263 77 289 2997: Me too. I'm very happy. Thank you so much
20/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes we can start
20/11/23, 12:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the acceptance letter ?
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes I did
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment mode in depth ?
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 289 2997: Yes please guide me
20/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
