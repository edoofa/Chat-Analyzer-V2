It's inspiring to hear about your teaching career spanning over 25 years and the positive impact you've witnessed in your students' lives. Your commitment to ensuring the highest level of education for your own children is commendable. Indeed, education is a powerful tool for emancipation.
20/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 693 2588: So l come from a family of 3 girls, my older sister just graduated from a local university with an accounting degree but she is not employed yet and my little sister is in form 1 at the same school as me. I am a self driven person, as one of strengths and l do all my work whole heartedly and to the core, l can work under pressure and to not like to half do my work . I do not have any weaknesses per say except for the fear of failing in my academics. As for my hobbies l enjoy playing volleyball and I'm a great player in my school team , reading novels and exploring nature. My current educational level is L5 and my combination is Pure mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. I aspire to do medicine as my career path because l believe I'm academically gifted and l would want to help others around me with it. I've seen the people around me experience great pain in loosing their loved and would want to help in diminishing that pain.  Being a doctor would be a dream come true in my eyes and l would want to make it possible by all means necessary. My mom is a high school geography teacher and my father is an Hr consultant. Both my parents have been supporting me and my siblings for our education hand in hand but for my higher education l believe my father will be the one supporting me financially. At my current school, the per term fee in usd is  592usd. My current school is St David's Girls high Bonda and it is also where l did my O level education. I stay in Harare metropolitan province

20/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 693 2588: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 693 2588: Those are my olevel results
20/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 693 2588: First term report
20/12/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/12/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
20/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 693 2588: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 693 2588: Well appreciated thank you and I'm confident l'll even aim for higher points
20/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 693 2588: Unfortunately l did not apply to any abroad universities but l did do some research
20/12/23, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 693 2588: Noted with thanks and well understood
20/12/23, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nokutenda, I would like to ask you if you are interested in the Medical field, so, why haven't you pursued Physics at A level?
20/12/23, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
20/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 693 2588: If l could not get a scholarship abroad and study in Zimbabwe, Physics is not a requirement at all to do medicine in Zimbabwe and l have no passion in Engineering so l never wanted to take Physics. Doing Physics , Biology and Chemistry as a combination in our Zimbabwean curriculum is really hard so l never considered that
20/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 693 2588: So you're saying if l were to do medicine in India l have to do Physics, Biology and Chemistry?
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nokutenda, Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
