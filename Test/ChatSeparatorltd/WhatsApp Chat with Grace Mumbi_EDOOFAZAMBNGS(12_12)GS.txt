Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 12:09 pm - +260 97 7163660: It's about scholarship to India
12/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
12/12/23, 1:07 pm - +260 97 7163660: So how do we proceed with it sir
12/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Fanny mwale,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 1:08 pm - +260 97 7163660: It's about scholarship for our daughter to India
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes that's correct
12/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Mwale, as we start your  daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 6:31 pm - +260 97 7163660: Thank you have a good day too
13/12/23, 7:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

14/12/23, 10:56 am - +260 97 7163660: Interesting
14/12/23, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: So now Mrs Mwale, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +260 97 7163660: Do you sometimes try to help your students get employment  or you just educate them and let them go
14/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Mwale in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of our Earn While You Learn Program which you will be introduced ahead in the counselling session is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
14/12/23, 11:26 am - +260 97 7163660: Alright sir
14/12/23, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
14/12/23, 11:36 am - +260 97 7163660: No questions
14/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
14/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 7163660: No
14/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*

14/12/23, 12:54 pm - +260 97 7163660: Are there any  expenses when a child gets 100% scholarship
14/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: The scholarship is only on tuition fees so if you manage to get 100% scholarship then there will be no tuition fees.
14/12/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 7163660: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7163660: Alright sir
14/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs Mwale what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/12/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7163660: Wonderful
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes sir
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mwale, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - +260 97 7163660: This is great news sir
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
14/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

14/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Grace?*
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - +260 97 7163660: Can the given projects be  of benefit for entrepreneur activities
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - +260 97 7163660: What are the individual benefits that a student gains from EWYL apart from a scholarship
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the EWYL teaches students how to do networking, and how to talk to influential people, helps them in gaining confidence, teaches them how to be a leader, and I believe these skills are essential for someone to be an entrepreneur.
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7163660: Can one apply for employment after the EWYL program
14/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mwale in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job, EWYL just makes the job ready so they have edge over other students.
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 7163660: Thank you very much for the information sir
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 7163660: Well understood
14/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: *So do you think this will benefit Grace?*
14/12/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes very much sir
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs Mwale, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - +260 97 7163660: Well understood sir
14/12/23, 2:02 pm - +260 97 7163660: So it is possible for the students to earn scholarship credits to zero as long as he or she is willing  to work hard to sponsor his or her education
14/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, as long as students are willing to do hard work, they can self-finance their education to as much extent as they can.
14/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/12/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7163660: Well that's exactly what I wanted to hear from you sir
14/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mwale, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Grace for her higher education.
14/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes sir
14/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes sir
14/12/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mwale as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7163660: $1500-$2250
14/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Mwale, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 7163660: Alright sir
14/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 7163660: Very true
14/12/23, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 2:26 pm - +260 97 7163660: I don't understand the question sir
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7163660: It is
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes it is very good
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 7163660: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 7163660: do You first select the students before them being told to pay the admission fees?
14/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
14/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - +260 97 7163660: Not really
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mwale, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 97 7163660: Yes sir
14/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
14/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
14/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
14/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7163660: A student is able to choose any University in India
14/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Grace can choose from any university that issues an Acceptance letter for the scholarship seat for Grace.
14/12/23, 2:44 pm - +260 97 7163660: Each University has it's own percentage of scholarship or all of them have the same
14/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Every University will have slightly different percentage of scholarship, but the scholarship will be decided through the counselling session, that is this session, the eligibility check evaluation, and the interview.
14/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 7163660: Alright sir
14/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 7163660: Noted
14/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY.
My name is Grace Mumbi  I am 16 years old and Zambian by nationality,I come from a family of 4 in which I am the second born and only girl. I completed my secondary School this year from Njase girls secondary School all thanks to my late grandmother who made it her aim to seek to it that I get educated.my parents could not manage on their own to educate me and so my grandmother took the responsibility, while at Njase girls secondary School I did my best, when I was in my final year I was chosen as the president for the child safeguard principles in which I immerged victorious because I understand the challenges of life. I took part in jets activities and was very active at all times.
My life has not really been perfect but I always wear a smile because I respect the will of God.sometimes all you need to do is pray to overcome some situations in life and home for the future,today in everything I do and when ever am writing my articles to people I use my self as an example life has not always been easy but I still have hope that one day all will be well.persistance and hope is all tht we need. my chemistry teacher Mr simulyamana once said to me that life  has a way of giving what is demanded of it,if you think you have lost you lose if you think that you have won then definitely you win all you have to do is believe and hope for the best.
Mr simulyamana is the most instrumental person in my life and I'll live to honour and respect him and in whatever I do I always remember his words. To all the people girls and boys,men and women going through hard times and facing different types of difficulties I would like to  say that have hope and believe only in the positive because what you think you are is really what you are and this life that we live is like a que  with patience your time always times and when it does you are free to pick whatever you want.

LIFE IN RWANDA AFTER 16 YEARS OF GENOCIDE.
Life in Rwanda continue s even after 16 years of genocide.Rwanda has rebuilt itself in the aftermath of that tragedy, setting itself apart from other developing nations by  intelligently, efficiently,and transparently making the most of other nations investments and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social services, entrepreneurship and basic infrastructure.
From aids to family health, you'd be hard pressed to find a nation that's shown better results for money spent in improving health care fundamentals.Nevertheless getting those basics right are only the foundation of the nation's broader plan to become a middle - income country by 2020.
While I have yet to meet anyone who fears another genocide in Rwanda,there are many who wonder whether Rwanda will continue to develop in stability or meet some sort of chaos.The challenges are epic but so is the progress to date this nation has shown it can raise from the aftermath of unspeakable violence,and is determined to keep that momentum going and take the next critical steps towards prosperity.if the past 16years are any indication, Rwanda can do it .
16 years following the Rwandan genocide,survivors and their families continue to   present with considerable rates of PTSD and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms.
