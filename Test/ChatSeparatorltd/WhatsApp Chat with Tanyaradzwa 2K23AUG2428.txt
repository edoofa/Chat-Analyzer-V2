05/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 898 4704: Okay yes sir.So are there any personal statements required or essays
05/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, there would be and you will be provided with detailed information on our future sessions.
05/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 898 4704: Okay sir
05/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 898 4704: Yes sir I am
05/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).

*Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 898 4704: Yes sir its clear

09/10/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Excuse me for not being able to connect with you on saturday. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Quite excused . Yes we are
09/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the videos?
10/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.
10/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing shall I help you with the understandings?
10/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Thank you for appreciating us.Helping us with the understandings maybe can  make us rhrough
10/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.

10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we are
10/10/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
10/10/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
10/10/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

10/10/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

11/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
12/10/23, 7:30 am - +263 77 226 0877: We are ready but Tanya will be free to answer end of November after finishing writing her exams
12/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Tanyaradzwa.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Thank you for letting me know about Tanya's availability. We completely understand the importance of focusing on exams. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we are
12/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: ow that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
12/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we sre
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Sure
12/10/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 3:59 am - +263 77 226 0877: Yes but l did not understand were you said we should pay a registration fee of  500 to 750 USD  which willbe waved to the  first year fees It seems we are paying but you said its a scholarship on that note l don't understand
13/10/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Tanyaradzw. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message as I was not available at the time. Let me help you with your concerns here. 

The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, is a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
13/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was hoping for a response from your end regarding our conversation about the admission process so that we can complete our discussion in due time. However, I did not receive a response from your end. Please let me know if you have received my message so that we can proceed and complete our session for the admission process.
13/10/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 257 2784: We received the message go ahead
14/10/23, 8:05 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tanyaradzwa.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
14/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we are
14/10/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 226 0877: So do you mean to say  $2000 to $3000 per year is paid by us
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is the weekend and we have limited time during the weekend, I will be closing our session for now. Let us connect on Monday from 3:00 onwards to further proceed with our session. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you have a restful weekend with your family.  I was unable to connect with you further as I was a bit under the weather. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we are
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
17/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 226 0877: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 257 2784: Noted
17/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
17/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
17/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: may I know if we are still connected @263772572784 @263772260877 ?
17/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we would be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 20th of October. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 20th of October so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. May I know by when you might be available for that?
18/10/23, 5:14 am - +263 77 226 0877: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are well and blessed. I was waiting for a response from you the other day, hoping to continue our conversation regarding the admission process. However, I was not able to receive a response from your end concerning the same. I would like to let you know that I am now active and ready to take on our session.

20/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 257 2784: We are ready

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 257 2784: I am tied up at work.
21/10/23, 9:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I kindly request that you suggest a comfortable time during the weekdays for our session? This will help us proceed smoothly.
21/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 257 2784: From 10.00 on Monday
21/10/23, 9:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As available hours will be passed by that time, may I kindly inquire if you could provide me with a time in the evening that would work for you?
21/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 257 2784: 7pm
21/10/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing your availability, and I appreciate your flexibility. Let's schedule our session for Monday at 7:00 pm.
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Make it 7.30 that is when we will be available
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can connect at the said timeframe.
25/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 226 0877: We are ok and you
25/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear you're fine, I am fine too thank you for asking. Shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 226 0877: Yes we can
25/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to recieve my above message?
26/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities.

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
