But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?

20/12/23, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 254 0133: This course in my country is underrated to begin with, to get recognition and being able to grow would be difficult, but being abroad means more exposure l get to meet international companies and l also get to interact with international students meaning l get to learn a lot.
Another reason is if l get into the Edoofa program it's going to be cheaper for my parents because there's support in payment unlike here it's going to be expensive because they have to pay the full fees <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Duly noted Anesu.
20/12/23, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I want to be able to change the fixed mindset that's in the education system that art subjects do not really deserve recognition, l will be holding seminars whereby l show students who want to persue careers in ARTs that it's possible and there are a wide range of courses they can select from and they can do it 
I also want to change the idea that Art subjects are the last option they should be the first option just like sciences and should not be looked down upon.
I also want to show students that they should not be shy to fulfill their dreams because out there other students are doing it too
I would also use the skills which l would have attained to pass this message all over schools in Zimbabwe. So l will be using newspapers , news channels and books so that every student in my country get to hear the message l would be passing
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I will contribute learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in Zimbabwe by establishing partnerships with colleges and schools . I will offer my knowledge through workshops , seminars and even training sessions with the teachers so that they also can share it with their students.
 Also, Enhancing the curriculum . I will collaborate with educational authorizes, curriculum development teams and subject matter experts to propose revisions or additions to the curriculum .
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Anesu, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I do agree
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes l am curious about that
20/12/23, 4:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
