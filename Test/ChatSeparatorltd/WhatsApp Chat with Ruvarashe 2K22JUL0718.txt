21/09/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to connect yesterday may I know if you can connect with us now?
21/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Good madam
Sure we all good to go
21/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam
21/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam let's do
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 687 1228: True mam
21/09/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Understood mam
21/09/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/09/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam we discussed the part of the registration fee
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2400 to $4000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam
21/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Good afternoon ma'am yes following
21/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
21/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
21/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 935 1770: So let's say $3600 per annum t do one pay the amount once in full ?
21/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK thank you answered
21/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
21/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/09/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Any leads on visa fee as well as flight expenses?
21/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself and the cost of Visa is for $83.
21/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK thank you
21/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 935 1770: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK you mean in the next coming days?
21/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
21/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK thank you
21/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/09/23, 11:08 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes we have reviewed mam
21/09/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 11:12 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Understood mam ..clear
21/09/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 11:15 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes mam
21/09/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 11:28 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Noted mam great endowment
22/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/09/23, 6:47 am - +263 77 935 1770: Good morning sorry it was late yesterday. Today we are going for worship. If possible we can discuss tomorrow
25/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, and had a fruitful weekend, Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us today so that we can move ahead with the discussion?
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Good afternoon madam
25/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Most welcome let's do
25/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have any queries so far?
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 935 1770: No queries so far
25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 7, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 7, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 7, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Understood mam would request that leeway for payment too it is reasonable
25/09/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Please provide more information
25/09/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/09/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/09/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Thank you for the explanations. May you please clarify on the E passes. You said 2 Es can make one qualify but a student with less than 6 points would not get. Isn't it 2Es are less than 6 points? I didn't understand
27/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for the delay in response. Let me help you understand. I guess you have misunderstood the statement, here we wanted to explain that there have been scenarios where students fail to attain 6 points in their A-Levels and it is not practically possible to get a 50% scholarship if they do not get at least 6 point in the A- level, however here at Edoofa the minimum requirement to get a 50% scholarship is 2E grades,  though we always encourage the students to get more points so that they can get even a better quantum of scholarship, however the minimum requirement to get 50% scholarship is 2E points.

I hope you are clear now?
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Great understood and it's clear mam
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
27/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 687 1228: All is well mam
27/09/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 687 1228: True mam
30/09/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Good evening sorry today we were not available we were at church
30/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 935 1770: We thank God if you are now feeling better
05/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. Please excuse me for my recent absence and not connecting with you, as I have been under the weather though I look forward to connecting with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Good afternoon ma'am hope you are well
05/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better now. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes we can talk
05/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear so far?
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 935 1770: So far so good
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Please may you kindly explain
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Oh ok   on that note she is writing this year 2023 so she will wait for 2025?
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779351770 No, since she is writing her exams in November 2023, her results will be out by February 2024, and hence she opted for August 2024 intake, however, I know this is not going to happen but if she fails to get a minimum of 2 E grades then if she is willing to re-write her A- level she will be able to join for August 2025 intake batch and pursue her bachelors degree.

I hope we are clear? <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK ok so if she gets E grades or better she proceeds next year August 2024...but if she fails she rewrites and waits for 2024 is that correct?
05/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, however we do have a benefit here also that will not put a hold on her education, let me explain. 

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes ma'am it's clear. How long is the diploma?
05/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A diploma course is also a 3-year course.
05/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Ok
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Following
05/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Not yet ma'am
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Ruvarashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Ruvarashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes we are
05/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK thank you ma'am
05/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/10/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ruvarashe.

14/10/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents Ruvarashe!

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter now?

16/10/23, 11:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Once you are free, please let me know.
16/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 935 1770: Ok thank you
17/10/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ruvarashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Good afternoon we are fine thanks and you
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion about your offer letter. May I know if we can move ahead now?
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Sorry was traveling yesterday so the network was bad
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 935 1770: It's fine we can proceed
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Yes we did go through
17/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 935 1770: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 935 1770: So is that the money to be paid?
17/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 935 1770: And how is the university it's good isn't it?
17/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam we did go through
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Ruvarashe, we will discuss the same moving ahead during our conversation. For now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 935 1770: 1. $1225
17/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 935 1770: 2. 4 years normal duration
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 935 1770: 3. $200
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 935 1770: 4. $700
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
18/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Afternoon mam
18/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Very clear indeed
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Noted mam
Is the accommodation fees included on the scholarship tuition fee or it's Seperate ?
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 687 1228: How much is the accommodation fee for a standard air-conditioned room per ununum?
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the accommodation fee, it is not covered in the scholarship, however, is included in the $2000-3000 per annum costs that were informed to you earlier. I hope this is understood?
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Understood yes
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/10/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes mam
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 935 1770: So on the campus accommodation she doesn't have freedom to choose what she eats. She eats what is prepared for that particular meal?
18/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's correct. In the on-campus accommodation, the meal plan is standard, and students are provided with a set menu for each meal. The university's mess services offer a variety of dishes to cater to diverse tastes, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The menu is designed to provide a balanced and nutritious diet for the students. I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 687 1228: OK noted
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 687 1228: OK noted ..l have noted on the bank details ..the banks are all in India ..is there possible a way or method we can use to deposit or pay the amount from here in Zimbabwe .
I other words how convenient can we pay from Zimbabwe
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 935 1770: No we are residing in Vic falls
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 687 1228: We are in Victoria Falls town
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Thank you very much for this method mam
18/10/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes please you may do so for variety sake ..would appreciate it
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Thank you
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK ok yes it's clear

19/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 687 1228: Wow this is great news indeed
19/10/23, 11:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 687 1228: Thank you mam
19/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Good afternoon ma'am. Thank you very much for all the information and the beautiful university.So is the program recognized everywhere even here in Africa? We have seen some situations whereby a child studies abroad then comes and gets stranded. Do the Africans get equal opportunities that side where they study and become competitive so that wherever they go they won't have challenges?
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear your enthusiasm about the university and your future education. It's a great question you've raised about the recognition of the program and the opportunities for African students studying abroad. I completely understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that LPU has a strong reputation not just in India but globally.
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU's programs are recognized and accredited, and the degrees you earn there are internationally recognized. This means that when you return to Africa, your education will indeed be valued, and you should not face challenges regarding the recognition of your degree. LPU has a strong track record of producing successful graduates who go on to have fulfilling careers worldwide.
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: In terms of opportunities, LPU provides a platform for holistic development, and African students have the chance to become competitive in the global job market. LPU's career services and placement opportunities are designed to help students secure positions in top companies, not just in India but around the world. Many LPU graduates have gone on to work for leading organizations globally, which is a testament to the quality of education they receive. I hope this is understood?
19/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK thank you very much understood
19/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please!
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from LPU. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from LPU as a family yet?
20/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Good day ..sure we are more than excited
20/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 687 1228: It's fine real good opportunity

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Yes we we most concerned about our girl child security ..of which you address it adequately
20/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 687 1228: Otherwise the program offered as well extra curricular activities at LPU are fantastic
20/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 935 1770: Thank u ma'am.  I still have a question on accommodation where it's written provisional residential fee $700 that one is for what?
20/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 935 1770: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear your enthusiasm for the program and the overall offerings at LPU.

Regarding the "provisional residential fee" of $700 mentioned in the offer letter, this fee is generally for booking on-campus accommodation once the student arrives in India. It's an initial payment made to secure a place in the university's accommodations. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK ok it's now  clear. So if we don't make any booking that means she will have to look for an off campus residence when she gets there is it?
20/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 935 1770: How secure are the off campus residence
20/10/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
20/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 935 1770: OK ok thank you yes it gives assurance
20/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now may I know if you have any other queries as well?
20/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 687 1228: So far so good sure
20/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
