28/09/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/09/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.

29/09/23, 10:57 am - +265 992 06 11 03: My district of origin is Blantyre (TA Kuntaja,manyowe), I was born at Queens Elizabeth Hospital on 20 April, 2003 but I was raised in Mzuzu City. Currently, am staying in Lilongwe.

On education qualification, I wrote my MSCE this year on August. Fortunately, I have scoped 12 points at Maranatha academy.                         

 Besides that I have strengths and weaknesses. To start with strength, I like to do things that satisfy my heart so that tasks involved in should be easier to achieve and also I have a spirit of working hard. To end with weaknesses, as a child I  depend on my parents for me to survive. Then during family problems I think a lot as an independent parent as a result it affects my capability of thinking.

My hobbies and interests, I like praying and watching football during my free time and also am always interesting to hear other people's point of view during debate.

Am remaining with family background. <This message was edited>
