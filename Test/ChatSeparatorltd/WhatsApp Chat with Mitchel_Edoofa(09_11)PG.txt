I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Austin, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application of Mitchel for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
10/11/23, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mitchel, Continuing the session, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
10/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 142 4703: Am definitely confident about achieving it and am promising better points
10/11/23, 9:31 am - +44 7915 073745: Oky thank  you for  adding  me ,can  l come  back to you in an hour ,l want  to round up my work  .
10/11/23, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Ms. Matongo. <This message was edited>
10/11/23, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*

Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

But I would like to provide you a few similarities of India and Zimbabwe legal systems as Common Law Heritage: Both countries have legal systems influenced by the common law tradition.

Legislative Codes: Both have enacted comprehensive legal codes and legislation covering various legal aspects.

Judicial Hierarchy: Both feature a hierarchical judicial system, including lower courts, high courts, and a supreme or constitutional court.

Constitutional Framework: Written constitutions serve as the supreme law, delineating government structure and fundamental rights.

Legal Professions: Similar legal professions, including lawyers and judges, regulated by bar associations.

Rule of Law: Adherence to principles like equality before the law and judicial independence is foundational in both systems.

10/11/23, 11:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mitchel, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
10/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 142 4703: No we are not aware of that
10/11/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mitchel,Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/11/23, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
10/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 142 4703: For this one l cannot answer for them let's wait for their response
10/11/23, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mitchel I hope that you will be discussing this with them too, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
10/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 142 4703: No
10/11/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

10/11/23, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
10/11/23, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
10/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 142 4703: Ok l see
10/11/23, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Mitchel, Please go through the above shared information <This message was edited>
10/11/23, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this
10/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 142 4703: My question is the programs that you have stated above aren't they supposed to be in line with my career
10/11/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mitchel, allow me to clarify. The EWYL Program is designed for every student who enrolls in it. The tasks assigned are directly related to real-world scenarios, aiming to enhance their employability skills. This approach empowers students to self-finance their higher education.
10/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Ohhh ok l see
10/11/23, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Mitchel
10/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Of course l will
10/11/23, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
10/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Am willing to work hard to sponsor my higher education
10/11/23, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!
10/11/23, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
10/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 142 4703: 1
10/11/23, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Expert Career Counseling*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

10/11/23, 12:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
10/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 142 4703: My parents
10/11/23, 12:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
10/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 142 4703: It has been always their dream for their first born to go and study abroad they are really grateful and excited
10/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mitchel,I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
10/11/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Yaaah l think that's all
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Mitchel,

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*

10/11/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
10/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Yes
10/11/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mitchel, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
10/11/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/11/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
10/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Ok l understand
10/11/23, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!

10/11/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Mitchel!!!
10/11/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
10/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Yes
10/11/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
10/11/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
10/11/23, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
10/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Yes all is clear now
10/11/23, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
10/11/23, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

Are you having other questions for me?
11/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 142 4703: No

11/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 142 4703: So after talking to Valerie,the Earn while you learn program is for students and it helps them to make higher education affordable.lt is an opportunity given to all Edoofians.The tasks assigned are related to real world scenarios aiming to enhance employability skills.The credits the students get can be used to pay off significant part of their higher education fees and their university education more affordable.
11/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 142 4703: 7.yes
11/11/23, 4:09 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Academic Board, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living
11/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Ohhh l see so l didn't understand that part at first
11/11/23, 4:10 pm - Austin: Alright Mitchel
11/11/23, 4:10 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
11/11/23, 4:11 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
11/11/23, 4:11 pm - Austin: Dear parents, Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.
11/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Right now they are offline but after discussing with them yesterday they are going to raise the enrollment fee within the timeframe
11/11/23, 4:22 pm - Austin: Noted Mitchel, by when can I expect to hear from your parents please
11/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Tomorrow morning
11/11/23, 4:29 pm - Austin: That would be fine, Mitchel
The acknowledgement from your parents via voice note is important to proceed
11/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Ok
11/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Sorry for contacting you  late but l don't think l will be able to continue this session so do you mind if l can you can give a friend of mine my place who is doing sciences here in Zimbabwe and wanna pursue her career abroad
11/11/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: That is fine Mitchel, is there any reason for the discontinuing of the program?
11/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Yes , have just realised that the Zimbabwe law society studies Roman Dutch law which is different from yours
11/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Is it ok if l can add her parent's phone number tomorrow
11/11/23, 7:12 pm - Austin: There are few courses in the field of Commerce and Law which have similar basics across the Globe but the syllabus varies based on the location where you study the course

Let us take the example of the law. The basics of law are the same if you study from Zimbabwe, India, the USA, the UK etc but vary in terms of the type of laws, economy, governance of a country, etc. Once the student completes the course and wants to practice in a different country, then the BAR Council of the country will evaluate the subjects of the students and there would be an exam which he/she needs to clear after which they can practice law in that country. This procedure is the same if you want to practice it in any country. The Indian law degree is internationally accredited and you can practice Globally
11/11/23, 7:12 pm - Austin: Zimbabwe’s Legal system consists of Common law (non-statutory or unwritten Anglo-Roman Dutch Law), Legislation Case Law (Precedent) and Customary Law. India's legal system is drawn from three primary sources: the common law, religious law, and civil ('romanist') law. So you can see the similarities as both the countries were colonized and have adopted foreign jurisdictions.
11/11/23, 7:14 pm - Austin: There are many Zimbabwean students here in India who are currently pursuing law and I can connect you to them to understand their learnings and experiences.
11/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 142 4703: I understand but the Bar Council here in Zimbabwe takes a long time had a friend of mine who studied at Parul university but is not yet practicing law here waiting for the Bar council to approve
11/11/23, 7:21 pm - Austin: That is understandable, Mitchel because Parul University isn't a well ranked university and the degrees aren't globally acreditted
11/11/23, 7:22 pm - Austin: This is the reason, you have to be wise and careful when it comes to this decision making as it has a huge impact on your career
11/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 142 4703: I think have made up my mind now
11/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 142 4703: Let's give this opportunity to my friend
11/11/23, 7:39 pm - Austin: Noted Mitchel, I always advice my students not to rush to a decision because some things that you let go of are like diamonds that you throw away when it is dark. Only when it is the day, do you realize, they are diamonds and by then you would have already lost most of it. We can definitely consider your friend and that is not a problem. I want you to sit down, think about it, research and then come to a final decision. You can also interact with Edoofians doing law to understand the same.
11/11/23, 7:40 pm - Austin: There are students who even did attachments with Law firms in Harare and then opted for BA LLB in India through Edoofa Program
11/11/23, 7:41 pm - Austin: If your final decision is to discontinue, we will then revoke the application to offer the chance to the next student.
11/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 142 4703: My final decision is to discontinue
11/11/23, 8:21 pm - Austin: Noted Mitchel, let me inform our team to initiate the formal closure process of your application!
20/12/23, 8:43 pm - The group's settings have changed to allow only admins to add others to this group.
