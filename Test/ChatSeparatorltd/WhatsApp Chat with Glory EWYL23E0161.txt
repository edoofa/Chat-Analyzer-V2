23/08/23, 8:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
It is time for your session.
23/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 510 0890: Good morning to you too mam
23/08/23, 8:49 am - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 510 0890: Okay mam
23/08/23, 8:51 am - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
23/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 510 0890: Following
23/08/23, 8:56 am - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
23/08/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 510 0890: Ok mam
23/08/23, 9:41 am - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
23/08/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 510 0890: Following,so must l do this right away
23/08/23, 9:56 am - +91 78273 08969: No, Let us finish and then you can okay/
23/08/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 510 0890: Okay mam
23/08/23, 9:58 am - +91 78273 08969: Let us connect tomorrow.
23/08/23, 9:58 am - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Have a great day.
23/08/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 510 0890: Thank you mam have a good day

24/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 434 0441: I haven't talked to her today,  l am at work and she stays with her Mother , let me find out

25/08/23, 12:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let us have the session at 1:30 pm.
25/08/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Ok mam
25/08/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, You can share this.
25/08/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Following
25/08/23, 1:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

25/08/23, 1:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
25/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Following
25/08/23, 1:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

25/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Yes mam I'm following
25/08/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.
25/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Ok mam so when will l create the group

25/08/23, 2:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: So Glory, now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
25/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 510 0890: Yes mam understood
25/08/23, 2:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, We will start with the new project on Monday.

​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._

01/09/23, 11:03 am - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

01/09/23, 11:06 am - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

12/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/12/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

A hard working and
 determined student, that's what Mufaro Marufu was. She completed her secondary education at Harare high school and tertiary education at University of Zimbabwe. She had studied Accounting and was lucky to get a job as soon as she finished her degree because jobs were very hard to find in Zimbabwe. Mufaro came from a middle class family of 6 children. Being the first child she was very hard working as she wanted to uplift her family. She started working in a town called Mutare as an accountant at House of Zeki, a company that used to pay her well. She could manage to pay school fees for for her 3 siblings and buy groceries for for her parents while they took care of other responsibilities. Mr and Mrs Marufu were very happy because their daughter had reduced their burden. 
While working at HOZ Mufaro fell in love with the CEO of the company. At first she refused to fall in love but ended up agreeing because the CEO was very charming, she fell for his sweet talks and besides he was very handsome that any girl would fall for him. The CEO's name was Michael Rwizi. Mufaro and Mr Rwizi started dating love was really on fire. They were the best couple that people admired. They used to wear matching clothes when going out for a date. After 2 years of dating Mufaro got pregnant. She informed Mr Rwizi but he denied it. "You are too loose Mufaro. How could you agree to sleep with a man without knowing anything about his background?What type of a woman are you? I am a married man. My family lives in Harare and I have 2 children. I can never accept that thing you are carrying as my child. Get lost and never show me your face again.Do you here me?" He said in a very fearce way."How can you call our child a thing Michael? You are the father of my....... "She did not finish talking and Michael interrupted her." Enough of your nonsense. I told you l am a married man, just get lost okay. In fact you are fired don't come to work again. "Immediately he wrote a fake report that Miss Marufu had stolen money from his cabin and got her out of the company without any hearing. Mufaro was very heartbroken, she was shattered in to pieces. Her soul was crushed especially when her character was questioned. She collected all her belongings and left HOZ in pain, tears and regret. "Why did l do it? How will l live now? How am I going to raise this child on my own? What will l say to people? And my parents, what am I going to explain to them? Ooogh dear Lord, what have I done? What have I got myself into?" She asked herself many questions as she was on her way back to Harare where here parents lived in a location called Budiriro. When she arrived her parents thought she was on leave. Everyone was happy to see her and they had supper together as a family. After supper everyone went to bed. Mrs Marufu followed Mufaro to her room. She sat on a chair which was beside the bed. "My daughter, what's eating you up? I have been noticing you ever since you arrived, you don't look happy what's wrong?" Mrs Marufu who used to know her daughter as a happy soul could notice that something was wrong. "Nothing mom, l am fine. It's just that I'm tired. You know I'm always busy at work. I'm very exhausted mom let me freshen up." She took her towel so that she could go and take a barth but before she even start walking her mother held her hand. "l know you Mufaro. I'm your mother I can see when you are happy and when you are not. Don't lie to me, share with me whatever it is." She said in a very calm tone, trying to figure out what was bothering her daughter. 
"Mother l am a shame, I have dissapointed you, l am so...... "She could not finish talking as she was already crying holding her mother." No my child, you are not like that, why are you even saying such things? "She was hugging Mufaro tightly calming her down. Mufaro finally gathered courage and told her mother everything.
" Ooogh my God! What have you done my daughter? What will I tell your father? Did you forget how much he struggled for you to complete your studies at university of Zimbabwe?Did you forget he had to sell tomatoes in Mbare for you? He tolerated all the sun burns for who? It was for you Mufaro, is this how you repay him? Heee! Answer me! Are you dumb? "She was now fuming with anger. Mufaro had shattered her dreams." Jesus Christ of Nazareth, what have l done to deserve this?"Mrs Marufu yelled loudly that her husband woke up. He went to Mufaro's room. "What's happening Mufaro's mother? Why are you crying?" he asked curiously. "She is pr-e-g-na-nt, she is......"she didn't finish when Mr Marufu interrupted her." What! Is this what you have been teaching your daughter while I was out there trying to make her life better? Heeegh! Answer me Mufaro's mother, look at the out come of your upbringing. Now l understand why long ago boys and girls were never treated as equals. Because girls are worthless, they don't deserve education, they are useless, to heck with modernity and the so called gender equlity. I hate you Mufaro l hate you. Leave my house now. I said now! "Mufaro was now her mother's daughter because she had disgraced the family, but when she made the family proud she was Mr Marufu's pride and daughter. Mufaro left the house that night and went away. She was lucky enough to find a new job and started working again in Victoria Falls. She gave birth to a beautiful daughter and named her Anopaishe meaning God's gift. She raised Anopaishe alone as a single mother. Though she lived in a morden society, she faced a lot of troubles because of people who used to gossip about her. Some even called her daughter illegitimate, some used to call her characterlesss because she had a daughter out of wedlock. Society despite being morden still have some beliefs which noone can erase. However Mufaro managed to survive under such circumstances. She challenged societal beliefs that a child can not be raised without a father. She made herself a father and a mother to Anopaishe. She gave her the best education. She taught and natured her very well as she did not want Anopa to make the same mistake as hers. Anopaishe became a doctor after studying medicine in America for 7 years. 
After 7 years of education, Anopaishe came back home to Zimbabwe. She had found herself a boy who wanted to marry her whose name was Tinotenda Masuka. He came from a decent affluent family. His parents was happy with the allience and so was Mufaro Marufu. The two families fixed a date for the marriage. 
On the day of the marriage Mr Michael Rwizi showed up. It was now after 30 years. Mufaro almost fainted upon seeing him. "What are you doing here? You told me not to show my face to you again, so why are you here? Get lost l don't want my daughter's marriage to be ruined because of you." she shouted. "How can you get my daughter married without her father?Who is going to negotiate the bride price if I'm not here?" he said confidently with no shame. "What! Which daughter are you talking about Mr Rwizi? Are you talking about the daughter you rejected 3 decades ago? Do you have any idea of how she grew up, how she suffered because of you? When other kids were playing with their fathers where were you? She was labeled illegitimate, she always asked me about her father but I could not tell her that you rejected us because you have a family. I gave her my last name and today you claim that she is yours, really? Where do you even get the guts? Don't you have any shame? Why are you so greedy? You are here for the bride price right? You want lobola of a child you rejected, how dare you? You want cattle because you found out that her fiance is rich right? It's not happening Michael Rwizi. No! Not under my watch. I failed to fight for myself but today l will fight for my daughter and protect her from a shameless man like you. Get out of my house now. "she said looking into Michael 's eyes. He was very shocked to see that side of Mufaro." I am not greedy, but according to our Zimbabwean culture, it is the father who negotiate the bride price and the amount of cattle he wants to give his daughter for marriage, he takes the large amount of money. You know that this is my right and no one else. It's my right as a father not yours. Don't try to take away my rights. I will go nowhere because Anopaishe is my daughter and I am going to negotiate her lobola price. "he said with confidence and arrogance." Excuse me, l am sorry l don't know you but l heard you claiming to be my father. I am sorry for what I'm about to say but you can never be my dad and l will never call you father, for it is a shame to have a father like you and a disgrace to the name FATHER. I don't need you in my life. I only know my mother, and she is my father as well With all due respect Mr Rwizi get lost before l call the security. "Anopaishe said in anger. Mr Rwizi did not leave. Security! Throw him out." Mr Rwizi was thrown out of Mufaro's house and got a taste of his own medicine.
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wow, what a powerful and gripping story of resilience, strength, and the enduring bond between a mother and daughter! Mufaro's journey is a testament to the indomitable spirit that can rise above societal judgments and challenges.

Mufaro faced adversity with courage, turning her life around despite the hardships. Anopaishe, her daughter, exemplifies the strength inherited from her mother and the ability to define her own worth. The confrontation with Mr. Rwizi adds a dramatic twist, showcasing the triumph of integrity over greed and societal norms.

Your storytelling is truly captivating, weaving a narrative that resonates with themes of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of one's identity. It's a tale that reflects the complexities of life and the triumph of the human spirit. 👏💖
