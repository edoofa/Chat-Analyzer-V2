02/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: 2:There is a difference between right and duties in that ,rights refer to the legal and moral obligations and entittlements possesed by individuals or groups .Also they are privileges that are inherent to individuals and cannot be taken away for example right to vote,freedom of speech and right to life amongst others.On the other hand duties refer to obligations or responsibilities that individuals or groups have to fulfill towards society or others for example the duty to pay taxes ,to respect the law and also to keep the environment clean just.to mention but a few .
On another dimention there are human rights and civil rights ,wereby human rights are those inherent to all human beings regardless of their gender ,race ,nationality ,religion and any other status .Exampleof this include the right to life ,right to education and freedom from discrimination amongst others.Whilst civil rights include those rights that are granted by law and apply to people living within a specific nation or state.Usually the civil rights are granted to individuals by the government  to ensure equal protection and equal treatment under the law  for example voting rights and right to be heard .
02/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: 3:A prosecutor also known as a district attorney,is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases .Their primary responsibility is to prove that the accused has commited a crime and should be punished accordingly .Prosecutors work for the statr or country and investigate crimes ,decide which charges to file ,argue in court and negotiate plea deals with defendants .On the other hand ,an  attorney  also known as a lawyer is a professional who represents  individuals ,organizations ,or businesses in legal matters .They provide legal advice and represent their clients in court or other legal settings .Attorney s may specialise in various types of law including criminal law ,family law ,corporate law and intellectual property law .Unlike prosecutors who work for the government attorneys can represent both the accused and the victims in criminal cases or any other legal matter.
02/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: 4.As an individual I am interested in corporate law .The reason behind this is that   i think I will be able to advise businesses on legal issues and be able also to represent them in legal disputes and negotiations .Also studying corporate law will make me as a lawyer to protect the interests of shareholders ,directors and officers  to ensure that companies operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations .
02/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: As a person there are some skills that I possess which makes me believe that they can make me become a good lawyer in the future .Some of the skills include being a public speaker ,I am a girl who has confidence when it comes to performing in front  of the audience .I usually recite poem and speeches during assembly days at school .This made me at some point to believe that I have confidence and I am able to stand and speak .Also I am a person who is frank meaning to say I speak the truth and I choose to stand by it .With this I believe that carrying these skills with me I may one day become a successful lawyer.

03/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nosisa.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
03/08/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
03/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you maam
03/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Good day
03/08/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
03/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 035 0406: That's true maam
03/08/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
03/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes
03/08/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
03/08/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
03/08/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yea which means at the end of the day I have to choose one universitas university
03/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
03/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
03/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
03/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
03/08/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
03/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Thank u for the clarification,understood
03/08/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
03/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes
03/08/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
03/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
03/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Can u do another example using the $500
03/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, @263780350406 let me explain the same example assuming the registration amount is $500. 

As your registration fee due is $500, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $500 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$500 = $2300 and can be paid in two installments of $1150 at a gap of 6 months. 

I hope you are clear now?
03/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
03/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 035 0406: This is done before the coming out of results
03/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain. Since your year of intake is 2024, and as for your A-level, you will be appearing for that this year and so your A- level statement of entry along with your O- level will be required for the universities to generate your offer letter and once you receive your offer letter you will be required to pay only the registration fee to reserve your seat with the university.

I hope we are clear now?
03/08/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
03/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 035 0406: How are you maam

14/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
14/08/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
14/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 035 0406: No ma'am
14/08/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now Nosisa, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 035 0406: You may clarify
14/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
14/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Nosisa, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Understood
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the fee structure that a student will be paying will be according to the course they pursue every university has its own fee structure hence through the Endowment program you can reserve your seat with the current fee structure of 2023 without it being received for 2024, may I know if you are clear?
14/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
14/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maam
14/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 035 0406: No ma'am it has been made clear
14/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Provide with more ,I would appreciate that
14/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/11/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 035 0406: So for one to obtain a 100%what would be the qualifications
14/11/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
14/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 035 0406: OK maam
14/11/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes
14/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes
14/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Resources like
14/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Resources like we could help you with certain doubts that you might have in your A- level subjects or recommend you books to study for better understanding. 

May I know if you are clear now?
14/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes
14/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

13/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 035 0406: So that I let the parents know

13/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so could you please let me know a time by when you will be able to connect with us?
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you
13/12/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780350406 may I know if you were able to go through my message above, since I inquired about a time when you will be available to connect with me so that we can complete our discussion?
13/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam i think tommorow @1:00
13/12/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, we can connect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, however, the discussion left is not long so if you are available right now it will hardly take 10 minutes of your time.
13/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam let's continue
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok
13/12/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 035 0406: I wanted to ask per year how much is needed
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 035 0406: And does the university fee cover for both food and accommodation
13/12/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern @263780350406 may I know if you recall our conversation where the registration process was explained to you or do you want me to reiterate it for you?
13/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 035 0406: May u reiterate pLz
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand. I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Can u expagorate on "other basic expenses
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely Nosisa, the other basic expenses include your basic expenses like toiletries, stationery, clothes, etc. May I know if you are clear?
13/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Wait ma'am fou mean clothes we are given
13/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, By clothes here I mean small items like towels, and handkerchiefs some students don't bring and they purchase after they arrive in India.
13/12/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: These will be your personal expenses, the other basic expenses which will be included in the cost of $2000- $3000 will be Wifi, electricity and water bills.
13/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok
13/12/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 035 0406: So wah if the edoofian opt to stay out of cumpus
13/12/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can certainly choose that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/12/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Let's remove food and accommodation wah would be the expected amount per yr
13/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 035 0406: For University
13/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Given the student stays off cumpus
13/12/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780350406 I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, and after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
13/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now every parent has a question: why are they not told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly? I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University.Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
13/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now it is obvious that every university evaluates a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student get to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
13/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 035 0406: I understood maam
13/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you
13/12/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/12/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
18/12/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Nosisa,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
18/12/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
18/12/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

#2:$0
#3:1600
#4:$125+125=$150
#5:$1000
19/12/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 035 0406: It iz
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/12/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes ma'am thank you for the clarification
19/12/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Let's move on the duration of tym prior to payments
19/12/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

20/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 035 0406: To begin to day , there is this saying "success do not come on a silver platter"
20/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Therefore one has to work very hard so as to archieve the intended goals
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nosisa,

I trust you are all doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great Following up on our previous conversation, and the quote you shared on that note let us start with our discussion. So may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion today?
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes I am ready
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 035 0406: We may continue
20/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Understood
20/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
20/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
20/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 035 0406: I have understood the above let us continue
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
20/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes it's clear
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: What is the amount of the money that is supposed to be paid I the period 15days as mentioned
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Maybe you may help me <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes Nosisa, we will be discussing the same, please do not worry. I would really encourage you to be a little patient, please.
20/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam thank you
20/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Let us continue
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 035 0406: This is clear
20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maaam
20/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 035 0406: But I would greatly appreciate if u give a brief explanation about wat does MVN stand for
20/12/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely Nosisa. Mvn stands for Modern Vidya Niketan Univeristy. I would have shared the same with you during the insights of the university as well.
20/12/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Ok thank you
20/12/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Let's continue
20/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
20/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
20/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
20/12/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood really well. In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
20/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
20/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
20/12/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and this amount can be paid in two installments of $425 and $425, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
20/12/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes this is clear
20/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 02nd 2024*.
20/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Yes explain please
20/12/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *January 2nd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *February 2nd 2024,* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/12/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before January 2nd*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better what you are referring to right now is your full tuition fee for the first year, however, as you remember to get admission to a university you would first need to register your seat with the same. The $1000 here is the registration fee, which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If we adjust the registration fee from your total tuition fee for the first year which is $1850- $1000 then you are left with $850 which you can pay after you arrive in India, as explained above.
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you recall our conversation above the endowment program is a additional benefit for you to reduce your registration fee. The $150 is a grant for you on your registration fee by Edoofa.
20/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the registration fee is to be paid at once as per the deadlines stated by the university, however, since your application was processed under the Endowment Plan through Edoofa, you have already been given a payment plan where your registration fee can be paid in two installments of $425 each and the deadlines are given by the university.
20/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 035 0406: 425+425=850
20/12/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Isnt that am supposed to pay $1000
20/12/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
20/12/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you, sleep tight
