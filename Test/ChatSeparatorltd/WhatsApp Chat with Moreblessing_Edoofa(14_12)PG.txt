16/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 952 8001: Because.. The mid terms  were not easy
16/12/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Moreblessing!
16/12/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
16/12/23, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

18/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 952 8001: This will have a positive impact on my career as I will be studying in a country that produces such successful people therefore I will be able to learn how they got to where they are now
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 952 8001: I want to achieve my career aspirations by learning in a good Institute and working hard in my studies
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moreblessing, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 952 8001: No
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 952 8001: I'll have to get back to you on this one
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 952 8001: Can you please Explain further
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

18/12/23, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

19/12/23, 8:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Moreblessings?

19/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 952 8001: I'm am not doing fine as i have sad news to tell yu
Soo after yesterday's session.. Well my parents concluded that they can't afford to pay the fee... Soo this means that I will have to stop this process
19/12/23, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I Know the reason?
19/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 952 8001: They have too much on their plate like my other siblings fees soo...
19/12/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, More blessings,

But considering your per-term fees there in Zimbabwe and here in India are comparatively very high as here in India after providing affordable higher education it's important to weigh the potential benefits of affordable higher education against the employment landscape. In India, there's a promise of better study facilities and guaranteed employment opportunities, especially in fields like mechanics and small-scale jobs. Additionally, the prospect of self-financing through projects like EWYL, which offers scholarship credits ranging from 50-100$, is a compelling aspect. Engaging in real-life projects can not only enhance your skills but also contribute significantly to your future employment prospects. Given these factors, it might be worth considering this one-time investment for a more secure and rewarding educational and professional journey.

20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Moreblessing, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Thursday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
