As you mentioned that it is her desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because a student need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible.

18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on her career?
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: This is marvelous
18/12/23, 2:15 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Definitely she will get the much needed skills on her career to motivate her implement the aspirations of assisting the community with good technical expertise acquired during her training.
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: It will also be a motivational to her brothers and sisters to work extra harder  since she will be a family role model
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: No
18/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/12/23, 2:32 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Well noted
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

TIA Organics
18/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:37 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
18/12/23, 2:37 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Great
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
18/12/23, 2:52 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: This is a welcome Development especially when a child really mean education
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
18/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.

However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
18/12/23, 3:05 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: I have no one to support fees payment
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: May I know why, please?
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: From my family line am the only one employed , the rest did not proceed with education
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kunal: I understand
As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
18/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: I do involve myself in farming though there are a lot to f risks due to impacts of climate change ie elnino, cyclones etc
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: I feel good and I dream that my child one day will have her dream come to pass as she wishes
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Passport or visas to add
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?

18/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 4:24 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Will come back to you later

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." - Sam Levenson*

19/12/23, 9:45 am - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
19/12/23, 9:46 am - +265 999 32 44 73: Yes
19/12/23, 9:48 am - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
19/12/23, 9:48 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/12/23, 9:48 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
19/12/23, 9:52 am - +265 999 32 44 73: Very clear
19/12/23, 10:33 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
19/12/23, 10:33 am - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

Are you ready for the same?
20/12/23, 12:44 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Yes, Austin
20/12/23, 12:46 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mr Vannex

I hope you are doing well
20/12/23, 12:46 pm - Austin: I have noted that you have been very active throughout the sessions. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
20/12/23, 12:54 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Am doing fine
20/12/23, 12:56 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: I have keen interest on this scholarship as I have seen it may bring a very big impact on my daughter if accommodated.
20/12/23, 12:59 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: But my challenge currently is how to source start up capital as stipulated in the scholarship condition as currently am having three children whom am paying school at secondary level
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Austin: Good to know!
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Austin: That is a genuine challenge and I understand, Mr Vannex
May I know, are the three of them in secondary level now?
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Yes
20/12/23, 1:08 pm - Austin: Noted, so when are they completing MSCE?
20/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Two will complete 2024; the other one 2025
20/12/23, 2:09 pm - Austin: Thank you for informing me,
I believe, as a parent, you might have certain plans and preparations for the career of Mercy and siblings. So would you like to share them so that I can guide you in the best possible way
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Plans are available like trying to accumulate enough resources to meet fees demand though am being twisted up and down to make ends meet due to limited resources at my disposal to meet ever demand of daily basic needs.
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Austin: I can understand the pressure, Mr Vannex and I just had a discussion with our Academic Board. The best I can do would be to recommend Mercy's application for a higher quantum of scholarship on tuition and sponsorship on Accommodation which would completely depend on her performance in the eligibility interviews and the evaluation of our Academic Board
20/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 999 32 44 73: Currently am under strong pressure due to financial state am currently in due to high dependency ratio then plus the state of kwacha devaluation the country has undergone that has made life so tough due to high commodity prices plus increased fees as a result of the same so thus why am saying currently am only able to manage few transactions.
