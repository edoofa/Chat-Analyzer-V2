05/09/23, 1:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Simba,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

15/09/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, kindly excuse me for the late reply, I was on a short break. Thank you for sharing the update with me. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Am driving home. I will be home in an hour
15/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, May I know if you are ready to proceed?

18/10/23, 12:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
19/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Good day. Its not that I am ignoring messages. Simba has started his examinations and hardly has time to read messages. I have been standing in the gap for him between the 2 groups you are using, and that is also in between my work schedule. I am heavily weighed down right now with preparing budgets for the coming year at work. I am not sure really how best I can work around this. Just this morning I received a message saying all is well, and one the other hand you are not pleased. Kindly advise what needs to be done exactly
19/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Greetings Simba and parents!

I suggest you please let me know your preferred time so that we can proceed with the session and move on with the admission process for Simba.

19/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, shall we proceed with our session in the evening at 7:30 PM?

So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?

19/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Letter sent by universities who have accepted my application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.

19/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
