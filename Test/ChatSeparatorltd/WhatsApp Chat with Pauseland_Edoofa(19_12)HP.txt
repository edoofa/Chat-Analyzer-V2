20/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Pauseland, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l agree with you, commitment from parents is very important.

They are all aware of my plans and are very willing to support me even mentally , they are very supportive of my desire to study abroad but they are not in a position to financially support me due to their disadvantaged circumstances
20/12/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Pauseland,

So can you please elaborate your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l understand that the financial aspect of this program includes tuition fee so what l meant is that my parents  cannot fully afford  tuition fee but will assist and they are willing to assist with the little they are getting in order to promote this system
20/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 377 6533: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Indeed and I do understand, Pauseland.
20/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: May I know what has been their budget for your higher education?
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay they are under budget but are subsidiary farmers , they grow crops for resale and  a part of my mom's salary  and the little that they both get is saved for my  higher education with high hopes that they will get helped

20/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Their budget for my next term tuition fee is 40 USD and 20 for stationery
20/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however I am referring for your higher education after A level, Pauseland!

What's the financial planning for that?
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 588 0702: approximately 300 USD for tuition fee, living expenses and everything
20/12/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Received please
20/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: Pauseland, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
20/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared document as well.
