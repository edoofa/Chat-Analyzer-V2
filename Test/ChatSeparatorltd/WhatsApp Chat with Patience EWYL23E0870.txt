Happy weekend!🚀
11/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Afternoon to you too ,how are you ,I dont have internet access at the moment I'll make sure to take my time and watch it later
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 820 3042: I think it is to give us (students) an opportunity to learn about the bussiness world and to earn credits that will be used to sponsor our education
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Thank you, well understood
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Its nice to meet you Miss Davi and Ms Sanjana i look forward to learn from you
11/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ,very.
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights! 

Now let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Good day!☀️
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 🤯Hmm thats new 

Im sorry i wasn't available yesterday due to some reasons
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Patience!

Let us begin our session with one of my favorite quotes: _'Every day is a fresh start, a new beginning. Seize it with optimism and determination, for even the smallest steps lead to great journeys.'_🌸
13/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 339 1635: 🙏🏻
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 820 3042: We may begin
13/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the newsletter?
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes i read it
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Exactly but i really like the story of one of the students an the quotes
13/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
13/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Amazing  😄 ,i cant wait
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes let me read it
13/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 820 3042: I understood the concept of awareness that is being well informed about the surrounding and the things or events happening around us
I also understood on acquiring the skills needed that is emerging skills which include online literacy ,creative content writing and remote team working and skills that are enduring which include business development and risk taking 

And then the 3 projects 
1.cooperate alliance 
2.community building
3.african schools education reform
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let us conclude today's session with a light joke!

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts! 😄
13/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 😹😹😹 you've a very great sense of humour......we connect agai tomorrow 👋
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 339 1635: Fiction is not in our vocabulary...
14/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, any character Patience, who's your favorite one?
14/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Good afternoon.......i dont read much but my favourite is peter pan
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ma'am 😁

I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
14/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Okay 👍
14/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Remember: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. Looking forward to our continued progress!
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Good afternoon, thanks for the knowledge

15/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Patience, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it patience!
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

18/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 820 3042: ....so am i doing the 3 projects simultaneously?
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Okay , okay understood,thank you
18/12/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
18/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Noted
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes please 😊
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

18/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨

To kick off our session with a festive spirit, how about starting with a Christmas-themed icebreaker? I invite you to share something related to the holiday season that holds special meaning for you. It could be a favorite ornament, a cherished holiday recipe, or even a funny holiday-themed anecdote. ✨🧑🏽‍🎄🎄
20/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Sure, 😊 why did the gingerbread man run away from the bakery ?
 Because the baker kept on kneading him 😉😅

20/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since your school is not connected with us,  I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
20/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:
