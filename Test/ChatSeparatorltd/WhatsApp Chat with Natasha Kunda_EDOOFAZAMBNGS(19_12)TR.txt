19/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Now,  before beginning the session, I'd like to know if you have any knowledge about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and what motivated you to apply?
19/12/23, 11:25 am - +260 779772379: All I know so far is that it's a scholarship program that is available to help people all around the world in terms of good education and I got motivated by those who are there as well and the good quality education that you give
19/12/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: That's right
19/12/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 11:27 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 11:29 am - +260 779772379: Yes please.
19/12/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
19/12/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
19/12/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - +260 779772379: Yes
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?

19/12/23, 3:09 pm - +260 779772379: Sorry for the late reply I'm having some network challenges
19/12/23, 3:11 pm - Tushti: Do you know anyone who is in the field?
19/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 779772379: No
19/12/23, 3:13 pm - Tushti: Well, I feel that you would help your country become better by attaining a respectful profession, such as becoming a lawyer
19/12/23, 3:13 pm - Tushti: Do you have any interest towards the field?
19/12/23, 3:17 pm - +260 779772379: Actually my interest is in development studies so I can't do law
19/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 779772379: I'm not really interested in law
19/12/23, 3:23 pm - +260 779772379: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Tushti: Noted
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: However, dear, developmental studies is a Master's level speacialisation cours
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: What do you wish to do at the bachelor's level
19/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 779772379: I think bachelor of nursing.
19/12/23, 3:54 pm - +260 779772379: Or bachelor of tourism and hotel management
19/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: Dear any course related to medicine requires physics chemistry and biology sparately
19/12/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: You do not qulaify for nursing
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - Tushti: But you do qulaify for these courses
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - +260 779772379: Bachelor of science in Nutrition and Dietetics
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: May I know why this course?
19/12/23, 4:04 pm - +260 779772379: Because I feel there few qualified personnel in the country.
19/12/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
19/12/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: Once you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/12/23, 4:12 pm - +260 779772379: What about a bachelor of science in physiotherapy
19/12/23, 4:12 pm - +260 779772379: ??
19/12/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: What changed your mind towards this course?
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - +260 779772379: No I haven't changed my mind I'm still interested in bachelor of science in Nutrition and Dietetics but I just wanted to know more about physiotherapy as well
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Tushti: Then you may do some extra research on your own
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Tushti: Do let me know what you find
19/12/23, 4:22 pm - +260 779772379: If I was to get into the Edoofa program and complete that course I know that I would work hard and help the people in need and I would help them eat healthier than they do and help them live better lives.
For me it would be a privilege to be part of the Edoofa community
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 779772379: Because there few institutions of higher learning offering such programs here in Zambia so it would be a privilege to study abroad.
19/12/23, 4:35 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 7331839: Yes
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 779772379: Yes please
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - Tushti: So, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - +260 97 7331839: About $2,250
19/12/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 4:42 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:42 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 4:42 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 97 7331839: That's right
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 779772379: Yes of course
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: NAME basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before theirGrade 12 result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final G12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 779772379: Sure
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 7331839: Alright
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: Is this understood?
19/12/23, 4:48 pm - +260 97 7331839: Yes please
19/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
19/12/23, 4:49 pm - +260 779772379: No
19/12/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: Alright Natasha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
19/12/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 4:50 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/12/23, 4:50 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/12/23, 4:50 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 4:53 pm - +260 779772379: No thanks all clear
19/12/23, 4:54 pm - Tushti: Great
19/12/23, 4:54 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

19/12/23, 4:54 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
