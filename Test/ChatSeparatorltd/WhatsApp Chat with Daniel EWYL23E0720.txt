02/11/23, 10:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Daniel!
How are you?
02/11/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: I can completely understand your unavailability at the stated time, but simultaneously I want to share with you that since I have other prescheduled sessions before and after this slot, I wouldn't be committing for a time apart from this. However, what we can do is that your parents can attend the session on your behalf and get the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of the EWYL Program structure. This would helpus in streamline the learning and your progress.
02/11/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Daniel, I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Emotions ran high as the students shared their hopes and dreams, igniting a wave of anticipation. From wishes for kindness to dreams of adventure, the excitement was contagious! The air buzzed with the thrill of anticipation as the magic of Secret Santa bound hearts together in the spirit of giving. 🤗💫
So, dear student, *what do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this year*? 🌟🎄
