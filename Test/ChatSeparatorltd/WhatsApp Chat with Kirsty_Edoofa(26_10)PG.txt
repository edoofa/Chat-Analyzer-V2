26/10/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand that!!!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/10/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
26/10/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

26/10/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
26/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Okay now l get it
Thank you for explaining
26/10/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kirsty, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

26/10/23, 3:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know the name.
26/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Denzel Samu
26/10/23, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Denzel,
I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Austin, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application of Kirsty for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available! <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Kirsty, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 992 5915: I believe they will feel so great!!!
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kirsty, So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 992 5915: They will be so grateful indeed  because they know that studying abroad is a life changing experience for a student since it allows one to gain highly valued skills
26/10/23, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, Kirsty, they will undoubtedly appreciate the significance of studying abroad, recognizing that it offers students a life-changing opportunity to acquire invaluable skills.
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
26/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes that's it
26/10/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through the above information, Please let me know this.
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Thank you for explaining
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes tell me
26/10/23, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
26/10/23, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/10/23, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
26/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Alright alright
26/10/23, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Ok l understand 

So can you tell me Alevel results expected
26/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Okay
26/10/23, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kirsty, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
26/10/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know according to you at which stage we are?
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Stage 2
26/10/23, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Kirsty,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes you can explain
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes this is clear
26/10/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kirsty, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
26/10/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Pallika and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
27/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes l did had a great time with Ms Pallika

Yes lm ready
27/10/23, 12:28 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Kirsty

I hope you are doing well
27/10/23, 12:28 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
27/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes
27/10/23, 12:33 pm - Austin: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
27/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 992 5915: They said it's a good idea
..but we have insufficient funds
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Austin: Which financial aspect does you family feels to be challenging?
27/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Their salary is not enough to meet the whole tuition fees but they are willing to support for my betterment with the little they earn
27/10/23, 1:31 pm - Austin: I can understand, Kirsty
As per your understanding, how much is the tuition fees?
27/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 992 5915: This message was deleted
27/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 992 5915: $3000 USD but with Work whilst you learn can be 1500
27/10/23, 1:53 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living
27/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Okay l get it

Thank you
27/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 992 5915: So the tuition fee is 2000 before the EWYL
27/10/23, 2:03 pm - Austin: Have you compared the cost with that of studying in Zimbabwe?
27/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yes and l discovered that the cost are not affordable at all because the tuition fee does not include food and living expenses.
27/10/23, 2:32 pm - Austin: Let me tell you that our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1200-$1500 per annum with nearly 20% or more hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
27/10/23, 2:32 pm - Austin: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program!
27/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Yeah that's true 

The expenses in Zimbabwe much more
27/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Ontop of that getting quality education
27/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 992 5915: are*
27/10/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: Absolutely, Kirsty!
27/10/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: So, do you feel you will be receiving similar exposures and career opportunities that of abroad, in Zimbabwe as well?
27/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Here in Zimbabwe there are no career opportunities and graduates are ending up being vendors because of the economic hardships.Some students who have got potential are finding it difficult  to go to universities because of the high expenses which are not affordable . And as per my understanding l do believe that being an Edoofian will help me achieve my career goals since the University costs will be affordable.
27/10/23, 3:09 pm - Austin: I do understand Kirsty and there is a need to bring a difference to this situation!
27/10/23, 3:13 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 3:13 pm - Austin: Let me know once you are through
27/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Okay
27/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 992 5915: Alright
27/10/23, 3:31 pm - Austin: Are you done, Kirsty?
27/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 992 5915: No still downloading
27/10/23, 3:40 pm - Austin: Noted Kirsty!
27/10/23, 3:40 pm - Austin: Meanwhile,  can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
27/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 992 5915: I will be studying Bachelor of Commerce in India.The average cost for studies without a scholarship is $6000-$8000 US.The annual fee will be 2000-3000 US depending on my performance.The enrollment fee is $350 that is $200 within 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days
27/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 992 5915: The EWYL is a program that help learners to reduce the fees making them affordable.Students are given online projects so that they gain working experience whilst they will be getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits.This program help students to reduce their fees while they will be gaining working skill.These scholarship credits help to reduce their fees.For example let's say the annual fee is amounting to $2500 ,if you get scholarship credits  amounting to $125 a month ,this means that you can earn about $1500 a year and this reduces the annual fee to $1000.And also in this program there is no limit ,if you work hard you can earn as much scholarship credits to reduce your annual fees
27/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 992 5915: 7.Yes l am
27/10/23, 4:18 pm - Austin: Good Work, Kirsty!

At Edoofa 350+ Edoofians have arrived from Zimbabwe for just this intake and if you look at them, not all of them come from a great background. There have been struggles and challenges behind the journey of each and every Edoofian and family but it has been made possible only because of the long-term vision of the family

At the same time, we are well aware of the economic constraints and financial challenges in Zimbabwe, if I request a payment plan for you to our Academic Board in such a way that you can pay $100 in seven days and the remaining $100 within the month end if Kirsty qualifies for the Edoofa scholarship program,do you think it will be feasible for you?
07/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 339 5343: I appreciate that, but if yu can allow us to start 1 st week of December
07/11/23, 12:00 pm - Austin: I doubt if that is possible due to the rush of applicants. Rather, can you sit down as a family to discuss this payment plan and then you can share your feedback as this is an important decision
07/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 339 5343: Oky
07/11/23, 12:08 pm - Austin: By when will you be able to share the feedback with me?
07/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 339 5343: Soon give us 3 days
07/11/23, 1:00 pm - Austin: Alright, that would be fine
07/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 520 2671: are we going to be responsible for paying the air fare and how much is it
07/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 520 2671: When is the due date of paying that amount for a start..ts $350
07/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 520 2671: $350  is the enrollment fee is it?
07/11/23, 8:04 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
07/11/23, 8:05 pm - Austin: Yes please, 
If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not flight ticket because it is taken a limited number of times, maybe twice or once. After all, international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't often travel,so considering these the traveling fee
(airfare :-around $450) *is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one-time investment.
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check stage for Kirsty tomorrow, it would be of 1-2 days after which her result will be out and the due date for the enrollment fees will fall towards the end of next week. You can either pay the enrollment fee in full or $200 in 7 days and remaining in 30 days
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - Austin: Are you comfortable with this timeframe?
07/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 520 2671: not comfortable with the timeframe , instead will just run around, life  here in Zimbabwe is not easy we just trying to make ends meet bt it's tough especially our family we are  renting
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - Austin: I can understand the challenges, may I know, how much time will it require for you to raise the first part?
07/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 520 2671: oky we will discuss this as a family and will give you the update..
07/11/23, 8:27 pm - Austin: Sure, by when will you be able to share the feedback with me?
07/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 520 2671: by Friday
07/11/23, 8:30 pm - Austin: This is well noted, are you having any questions for me as of now?
07/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 520 2671: Yes why is  enrollment wanted so fast.. because  here in Zimbabwe we are paid once every month end and is no longer the 31st of every month instead it is on the 5th upwards.. however our salaries here are peanuts earning less than $150,can you imagine.. sometimes you just work for rentals and food only
07/11/23, 8:36 pm - Austin: I do understand
There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now and you are supposed to complete the enrollment soon

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5&6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
07/11/23, 8:36 pm - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
07/11/23, 8:36 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - Austin: Due to the same reason, may I ask, will it be possible for you to prepare for the higher education of your child abroad within a few months considering the economy of Zimbabwe?
07/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 520 2671: Yes
09/11/23, 8:13 pm - Austin: Good evening to you all!
How was your day?
09/11/23, 8:14 pm - Austin: Please note that from our experiences, parents find it challenging to raise the funds for education within a few months which is the reason, we have requested the Universities to offer provisional admissions for the children thereby giving them ample time for preparations
10/11/23, 6:37 am - +263 78 992 5915: Good morning
10/11/23, 10:08 am - Austin: Good to hear from you, Kirsty!
How are you today?
10/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 992 5915: I'm fine and you?
