17/10/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
17/10/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

19/10/23, 10:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: So far you have earned $21, but like you are saying, there must be some discrepancy in it.
19/10/23, 10:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share when these students were enrolled?
19/10/23, 10:59 am - +91 89682 42416: What maam it doesn't make sense from what you told me at first 🤔
19/10/23, 11:00 am - +91 89682 42416: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:01 am - +91 89682 42416: This is for Audrey Wandirai who paid last week
19/10/23, 11:04 am - +91 89682 42416: And then praise Chizema paid September
19/10/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:08 am - +91 89682 42416: And you said every student who paid his or her enrollment fee l get $100 n thn 100 again after other prt n lst 100 again when he or she arrives in India so I don't understand you maam
19/10/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please listen to the audio <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 11:10 am - +91 89682 42416: I didn't understand you properly maam
19/10/23, 11:10 am - +91 89682 42416: Can I call you if you don't mind
19/10/23, 11:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Tell me to write it down.

For *Praise Chizema*, she paid her partial enrollment fees of $200 in September for which you have already been given $20 as your scholarship credits. This student will not be considered under the $300 plan since the student application form for this student was shared before you were given the $300 plan 

*Audrey Wandirai*, paid her full enrollment fees this month, and for each month, the credits are reflected in the first week of next month. This means I would have told you about the same next month in the first week of November. This student will also not be considered under the $300 plan since the student application form for this student was shared before you were given the $300 plan
19/10/23, 11:24 am - +91 89682 42416: Okay ok l get it ma'am

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 12:45 pm - +91 89682 42416: Wrong text,,He did a mistake sorry 🤲🏻
15/11/23, 12:45 pm - +91 89682 42416: Otherwise how was your Diwali 😁😁😊😊
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

c) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

25/11/23, 6:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
Hope you are enjoying your first winter season in India! 🥶

I've received messages from you and other Edoofians at the University, expressing their focus on exam preparations. Considering your likely Christmas celebrations and festive engagements, the team and I thought it would be best to _relieve you from sessions until the end of December_. We plan to *resume our first session of the new year in the first week of January*. 😌
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Every week, I will connect with you for quick updates for 5-10 minutes*. Along with this, *you can share concerns with me Monday to Friday from 06:00-08:00 PM IST if needed🫶🏻*. I'll still be accepting student application forms and African school forms. If you _wish to schedule a one-on-one call for project-related doubts during this time, I'm more than happy to accommodate🫱🏻‍🫲🏼._ I hope you won't waste this time and stay focused on projects. I would appreciate it if you dedicate some time and show productivity during that period.

Best wishes, and enjoy the festive season!
