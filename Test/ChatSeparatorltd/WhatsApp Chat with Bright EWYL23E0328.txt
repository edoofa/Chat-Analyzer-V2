04/08/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to my Proud Edoofian!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?
07/08/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 714 6032: Yes I am.
08/08/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to my Proud Edoofian!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?
08/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 714 6032: yes.
08/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 714 6032: Not quite.
08/08/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let me explain. So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/08/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 714 6032: understood.
08/08/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
08/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 714 6032: ok
08/08/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 714 6032: I'm delighted to know them.
08/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
08/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 714 6032: sure.
08/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 714 6032: I have gone through it.
08/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 714 6032: let me go through this as well.
08/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 714 6032: All done.
08/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 714 6032: The quotes section.
08/08/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
08/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 714 6032: It surely is.
08/08/23, 9:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️

09/08/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself.

This project gives students an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. In the first part, I shall reach out to neighbouring schools in my region and inform the principals and headmasters about the Edoofa program and try to arrange an online meeting with Edoofa.
24/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

24/08/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
24/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
24/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
24/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.

25/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 714 6032: -Plumtree high school is located in Matebeleland South province.
25/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
25/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
25/08/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 714 6032: Ok.
29/08/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🌟
29/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 714 6032: Yes I am

29/08/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: How are you Bright?
29/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 714 6032: I am good, thanks and you?
29/08/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am great! Now, Bright  we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
29/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 714 6032: Sure.
29/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
29/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
29/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
29/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 714 6032: Yes
29/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
29/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 714 6032: I see
29/08/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
29/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 714 6032: Understood.
29/08/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, Bright since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
29/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 714 6032: Understood

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
29/08/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

31/08/23, 8:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, you know we could not connect yesterday because it was the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate their special bond. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐
31/08/23, 12:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emmanuel!

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
