17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Answer this
17/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 656 9693: My name is Solomon Anashe Mubvakure. I am doing form 5 at Zengeza 1 High School in Chitungwiza. Im doing Science subjects which include Mathematics, Physics, Geography and Technical Graphics and Design. 
I wrote 14 subjects at Ordinary Level while studying at St Faith’s High School and i got 7 A’s, 3B’s and 4C’s 
As for my career ambitions I find civil engineering to be an incredibly fascinating and meaningful field. I am drawn to the idea of designing and building structures that will have a lasting impact on people's lives. I am inspired by the opportunity to work on projects that can improve the quality of life for people in their communities. From roads and bridges to water systems and sewage treatment plants, civil engineers are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure that supports our modern society. I am also drawn to the creative and analytical problem-solving that is required in this field. There is always a new challenge to overcome, and the work is never boring.
Usually during my free time I like learning how to use AutoCAD and ArchiCAD since they will be some of the softwares i will be using in civil engineering. I also enjoy playing cricket. It is actually my favourite sport. 
My father holds a BSc degree in Agricultural Engineering from University of Zimbabwe. He is now a Lecturer at technical College in South Africa.
My mother studied up to form four.  She is a vendor and sells veggies and fruits 

We live in Chitungwiza. We have been living there since 2011. We are a family of six. My parents and four children.
There are four more dependent children from extended family that my father is assisting by paying school fees because they are orphans.    
The breakdown of biological  children and kids from extended family who depends on my father's income is as follows:
1. Three children at tertiary education
2. Three at high school 
3. Two at primary school level

The fees for all these children is so high that my parents are struggling to make ends meet that's why I  am applying for bursary.
17/11/23, 4:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself. 
So, could you kindly tell me how much *your  High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?

As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
21/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 656 9693: Its range is INR50 000 to INR200000
21/11/23, 1:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

22/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
22/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
22/11/23, 1:56 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I understand students do industrial attachments in order to gain work based experience during semester break. I'm not sure if it's how they gain scholarship credits
22/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about it in depth ?
22/11/23, 3:02 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes please,  you may guide us
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
22/11/23, 4:50 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I think EWYL is good practice as student get exposure to real world situation gaining work experience while at the same time earning scholarship credits that assist in funding the studies. 
It will definitely benefit my child since he will practice in industry principles that are learnt in class .
What I like most is about recruitment partners who assist Edoofians to be  placed in their fields after completing the studies.
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

22/11/23, 5:55 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I now understand how EWYL works but I want to find out something. 
Does it mean that a student will be working all the 12 months  without getting time to go for vacation?
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It's conducted online and students work according to their convenience in their free time
22/11/23, 6:18 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Okay. Thank you for information.
22/11/23, 6:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
22/11/23, 6:23 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes go ahead please I want to know more
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
22/11/23, 6:42 pm - +27 73 439 3017: That's true, you pay application fees
22/11/23, 6:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
22/11/23, 6:59 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I'm not sure, educate me please
22/11/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
22/11/23, 7:02 pm - +27 73 439 3017: It will be costly because  5 universities by $200 amounts to $1000
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
22/11/23, 7:26 pm - +27 73 439 3017: There won't be any assurance for scholarship
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes, I am ready for the challenge and I trust my son is ready also to meet the requirements
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
22/11/23, 7:40 pm - +27 73 439 3017: The general information I have about statement of purpose for scholarship is that you write a one or two page well-drafted statement that should explain the applicant's academic and professional background, the proper reason for applying for scholarships, and their future goals.

You may give me more information relating to Edoofa scholarship
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
22/11/23, 7:46 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Thank you,  I now understand the importance of statement of purpose
22/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - +27 73 439 3017: For 5 universities it will be between $600 to $1000
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 11:54 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
23/11/23, 12:00 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We're fine thanks,  how are you
23/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/11/23, 10:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 11:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 12:06 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We're fine thanks how are you
24/11/23, 1:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
24/11/23, 6:08 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I understand that on top of fees which ranges from $3000, there is also application fee which may amount up to $1500 and SOP which may cost up to $1000.

We have to pay Edoofa program fees which normally amounts to $750 but is reduces to $350 which must be paid within seven days. 
Due to economic constraints Edoofa allows payment of $200 within 7 days then the remainder after 30 days.
Edoofa assist in reducing cost by enrolling the student  so that he earn edofian points which can be used to cover part of the fees.
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
27/11/23, 12:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you had a pleasant weekend.

So shall we start our discussion now?
27/11/23, 5:02 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Afternoon,  I was busy at work today.

27/11/23, 5:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I apologize for the delay today; unfortunately, I'm not feeling well. We'll have to reschedule today's session, and I'll reconnect with you tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time
27/11/23, 5:49 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Okay, get well soon
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
28/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We're fine thanks,  how are you doing yourself?
28/11/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
28/11/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you go through this ?
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes I did
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: .
28/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We're done with stage 1. We're still on stage 2
29/11/23, 11:27 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
29/11/23, 11:32 am - +27 73 439 3017: We're fine thanks how are you?
29/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/11/23, 12:21 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes, you may explain to us
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/11/23, 4:05 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Thanks for the explanation
29/11/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
29/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I'm not sure of the visa application process,  may you take me through the steps
30/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: We have a dedicated admission's team at Edoofa they will help you with the process.
30/11/23, 1:52 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Thanks
01/12/23, 12:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 381 7481: We are fine and you
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the process?
01/12/23, 1:06 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We're not clear, we need assistance from your admissions team to take us through the process
01/12/23, 2:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What is not clear ? <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 2:41 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Must the student get admission letter from university first before applying for the visa or registration with Edoofa is enough?
I'm not sure if medical aid is a requirement for visa application as well
01/12/23, 3:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please reframe your question ?
01/12/23, 3:36 pm - +27 73 439 3017: What I understand from the requirements to apply for a study permit is that you must be having acceptance letter from a university showing duration of the course that you are enrolling for. 
Another requirement is that the student must be having medical aid.
I am not sure if these requirements are the same if I am registered with Edoofa .
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
02/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 656 9693: Sure thing we can proceed

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

02/12/23, 4:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
02/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 656 9693: We discussed as a family and we shared the same views.
02/12/23, 4:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answer using voice notes ?
02/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 381 7481: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/12/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/12/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/12/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 7 th  or 8 th December 2023 for $200 and the  7 th  or 8 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 7th  or 8th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/12/23, 5:29 pm - +27 73 439 3017: At the moment we're financially unstable,  are you not having other dates from February next year?
02/12/23, 5:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges are you facing ?
02/12/23, 5:32 pm - +27 73 439 3017: We are not able to raise that $350 now,  I will be able to get it monthend of January
02/12/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When did you start preparing for your child's education ?
02/12/23, 6:00 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Due to economic hardships we are living from hand to mouth  , we budget fees for each academic year because we have a lot of dependents. 
We don't have any savings that are dedicated to any individual child since it's economically unviable on our side.
02/12/23, 6:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How would you want me help you in this situation please considering we only have limited seats  left now ?
02/12/23, 6:03 pm - +27 73 439 3017: I would appreciate if you can reserve the seat till end of January because I get paid each month end .
02/12/23, 6:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I'd like to discuss the completion of Anashe's formalities. You mentioned facing challenges due to recent fee completion. I've consulted the Academic Board and have a viable solution. Can we discuss this further?
02/12/23, 6:04 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes we can discuss
02/12/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Anashe's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Anashe's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
02/12/23, 6:07 pm - +27 73 439 3017: Yes it will be convenient
02/12/23, 6:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answer using voice notes ?
02/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 381 7481: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 6:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you understand first partial amount you have to in 7 days of selection to reserve your seat ? <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 381 7481: Yes I understood $100 payment in 7days
02/12/23, 6:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Anashe's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for Monday?
02/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 381 7481: Yes no problem

02/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 381 7481: It's okay
02/12/23, 6:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Parents interview call has been scheduled for 12:30 PM CAT TIME ON MONDAY . Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call.

11/12/23, 10:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: @27734393017 @263716569693 @263773817481 Good Morning 
How are you doing ?
11/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 656 9693: Good morning to you too sir 

We are doing just fine
11/12/23, 11:05 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let me guide you
11/12/23, 11:06 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
11/12/23, 11:06 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

11/12/23, 8:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
