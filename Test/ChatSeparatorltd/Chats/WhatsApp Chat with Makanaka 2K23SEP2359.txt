Moreover  having our son occupied  fully with  the EWYL Program  is also a good  program  that will  build  his career  and make him a better  person  in terms  of how he relates to people  as well  as his skills  in his profession .The way  we already  feel  connected  to  all of you  gives us the picture  that our son will  not miss home as he will  be  in his second  family  or home.
29/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Yes sir....Firstly l would like appreciate my counselor he really helped me to get an insight....so l really like the idea that edoofa helps me step by step  to enable me to achieve my dreams and it also makes it affordable to achieve them.The EWYL program also caught my interest ....l am able to earn credits that would help me pay some my tuition fees and this really helps the burden that my parents where to face if they was no such program
29/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 591 9475: The type  of  universities  that  Edoofa has forwarded to us has also made  you unique. The way you  are  interested  to produce  a well  groomed graduate also gives us a sense of  pride in Edoofa

30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?

30/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Yes,sit.

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/09/23, 1:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 228 0605: We are following sir
30/09/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/09/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Very  clear sir thank e
30/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 228 0605: Sure sir

30/09/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the connection. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Yes sir
30/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Sure  sir  thank  you
30/09/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 228 0605: Might take some time sir
30/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Apologies sir the network is a bit slow but we are connected sir
30/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Afternoon  sir,network  is really  a challenge  this side.So far I have  managed  to watch two  of  the sent videos  and I  have  learnt that Edoofa  family  values  obedience  ,following  instructions given  by  those with the know how.In addition  the need  to  be positive and have  an open mind .I also learnt that the vision that  Edoofians have  is to  increase the  student's  capacity. Humility  to realise  how  fortunate  they  are to be able  to access quality  education  whilst they  also increase in knowledge  through  EWYL program. Finally  ,being able to increase their in knowledge and also gaining  experience  in addition  to  getting  the scholarship. Producing a student who is not a liability  but one is able to be responsible  enough  to  fend for  himself .
30/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Apologies for replying late sir.On the first video l learnt that edoofa is a program that is looking for students with  potential in their studies and is willing to help them achieve there goals with less financial complications but in this journey of helping they are also looking at some aspects like how faithful a student is in following instructions given ,how determined a student is in achieving his goals and open minded the student is, how he is willing to go an extra mile for his passions and vision
30/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 094 0477: On the second video l learnt about the vision of the edoofian program, firstly a student must not only be academically sufficient but must be able to know  how the world works and gain more exposure to how a person is able to be independent and self suffice and responsible in the out world,It also teaches me the value of obedience which grow even to the stage of employment where by certain policies need to be followed and certain boundaries not to be crossed,Thirdly by engaging in this family we grow united and we become a family of edoofians which are able to help each other through the bound they share and the experience,Finally the main lesson was how edoofa plans to enlarge or magnify the capacity of a student into something more plausible with utmost ease
30/09/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 591 9475: This message was deleted
30/09/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 591 9475: The fourth  video  is about  statement  of  purpose. A form where the student will  explain  why they  are  worth  helping. Giving  reasons  why  they  have chosen  a certain  program.
30/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 591 9475: The third  video  is explaining  the  way  Edoofa has carefully  chosen   the best universities for the students. It emphasizes  on how the  parent  body is concerned  about  quality  graduates produced by  a college   and the infrastructure .
01/10/23, 4:33 am - +263 78 094 0477: On the third video l had an insight on how  edoofa has carefully analysed a lot of universities and how it phased out some and stayed with the quality providing universities.The video also clarifies how important the choice of a university is
01/10/23, 4:54 am - +263 78 094 0477: Finally on the fourth video l leant about the statement of purpose, how it can be an advantage to a student to create a first impression,it also states the skills that are commonly looked at during admission and some of these skills we have been tested already through these  counseling sessions, since the statement of purpose is all about impression showing off your solid goals,academic achievements,your vision your passion all unique traits that might create an impression must be show cased in this statement
02/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 591 9475: Good  day , sir  .How are you  today
04/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Good day sir @918384048513 do we have any sessions along the week
04/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 228 0605: We understand sir
04/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 094 0477: Thank you sir .lf l may ask kind sir at what time is the session
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Good  evening  sir  ,apology accepted  .Hope  you  enjoyed  the holiday   ,sir.
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 591 9475: We are ready  any time  ,sir.
04/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We did start a lttile bit early today and I am happy that you are available for the session.
04/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
04/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
04/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 591 9475: Yes ,sir thank you   for the  elaboration
04/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 228 0605: We may proceed sir
04/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 094 0477: We can proceed sir thank you
04/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
04/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
04/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
