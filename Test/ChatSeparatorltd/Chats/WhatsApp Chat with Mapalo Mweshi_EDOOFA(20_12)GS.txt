Congratulations! Your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program has been shortlisted, and you have been selected for an early counselling session. EDOOFA is a trusted program for affordable, accessible & employment-driven higher education in India, with over 3000 enrolled students and associations with more than 500 schools across Africa.
20/12/23, 7:39 pm - Gurvinder: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
