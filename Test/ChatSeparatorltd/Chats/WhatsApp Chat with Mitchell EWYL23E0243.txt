04/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 510 4173: Afternoon Ananya,

Our financial situation is not good at the moment. We haven't completed her admission yet. Hence I am doubting if she will make it this  semester and I proposed for her to come next semester. This was not my wish and I am very very worried. But I assure you by next year she will be with you
04/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, @263715104173 Have you discussed the same with the admissions team?
04/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 510 4173: We are still discussing
04/08/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I understand.

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for informing me.@263715104173
08/11/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Session Rescheduling_*

In celebration of Diwali, we will be taking this Friday off. But the really exciting part is that I'd like to bring our session forward to today, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am. 

I can't wait to see you there, and I'm looking forward to a fantastic session!🌟
09/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *TUESDAY* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

14/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

The festive season has come to an end, and we are resuming our EWYL sessions! Our session is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Please join the EWYL Line on time.
12/12/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_8 minutes to go!_*

It's a new week, and your session is about to start! Get ready and join me on your EWYL Line at 9:30 AM!🕤
12/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 799 0354: Oky ma'am
19/12/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mitchell!

Your EWYL session is about to start. Join the EWYL line as we are going to learn some new skills today! 🏆
20/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,@27745518790 @263787990354 @263715104173 

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?

Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.

As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
20/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 799 0354: Oky ma'am
