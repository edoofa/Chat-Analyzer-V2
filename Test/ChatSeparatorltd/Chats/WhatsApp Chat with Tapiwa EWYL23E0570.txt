How are you?
30/09/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in responding. 
Yesterday I went to one of our partner Universities to meet our students and therefore was not able to address you.

30/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Tuesday onwards from 08:30-09:30 AM 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
30/09/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: We were planning to start from Monday onwards, but the organization will be closed on Monday in honor of the birth anniversary of our freedom fighter, Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi, whose full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. Gandhi's life and work left an indelible mark on not only India but also the world, as he advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving social and political change.
03/10/23, 8:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

03/10/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
03/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 342 2739: Looking forward to working with you too as my mentor
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why you responded after some delay?
03/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Sorry for responding late, network problems ma'am.
03/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that electricity issues and connectivity gaps are not in our hands but I would suggest that you either use the hotspot facility for connecting with me or use someone else device for connecting.
I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth is our priority right.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Yes i do understand.
Is it possible to shift our session to the afternoon slot.
03/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 342 2739: The 0130-0230 slot
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Network this side is a challenge and Tapiwa's shift starts at exactly 1.00pm so since he is working in a food outlet it is not allowed to use the foni during working hours my apology
03/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Yes 0130 - 0230 will be fine
03/10/23, 7:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, let me do so.
03/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Thank you
04/10/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

04/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Greetings yes
04/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Tapiwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good afternoon.
Okay my long-term goals are to be employed at a medical institution, to be at a higer management position so that i can be able to make a difference in the world
05/10/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
05/10/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is great, I am super delighted to hear that!
05/10/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 342 2739: The EWYL program play a pivotal role in me achieving my dreams. The EWYL program helps me finance my education and also gives me experience and exposure on what i will experience in the medical industry after finishing my studies.
05/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 342 2739: No Ma'am would really appreciate it if you explain them to me
05/10/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, let me explain them.
05/10/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: \The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Okay noted
05/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Well explained
05/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Okay noted..Greetings to you Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
06/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
06/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good Afternoon
06/10/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
06/10/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
06/10/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Done goin thru the vidz
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped about me from the video?
06/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Okay i have came to know that you have been a mentor for quite some time and you are so passionate on helping a students  achieve their dreams
06/10/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That you so much, this means a lot to me!
06/10/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
06/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 342 2739: In the video you also mentioned that you will be using your experience to help me achieve my dreams
06/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Yes i did
06/10/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is super true and I will do my best to help you achieve all you have dreamt of!
06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Yes ma'am. Its really super interesting
06/10/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/10/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good afternoon...

18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that now.
18/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'm eager to kick off some projects with you so that you can start earning those scholarship credits. To dive into this, I'd like to invite you to join the EWYL Line, where we can have an in-depth discussion about the projects and how we can collaborate effectively. Your success is our shared goal, and I'm excited to see you excel! 📈🌟🤝
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be held on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY* from 12:00-01:30 PM
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*MONDAY and THURSDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

07/11/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I want to extend my sincere apologies for my absence yesterday. I was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the grand orientation event that took place at one of our partner universities. It was an exhilarating experience, and the students displayed their enthusiasm by preparing some delightful surprises for us. This made the event truly worthwhile.
07/11/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I acknowledge that we missed our sessions last week and yesterday. To make up for this, I have scheduled a special 1.5-hour session tomorrow, during which we will cover all the material we had planned to address. Our session will begin at 09:30 AM and conclude at 11:00 AM. This extended session will help us catch up on everything and ensure we continue making progress as planned.
Also, from Thursday onwards, we will be beginning our preparation for our festival Diwali, therefore our session for tomorrow will also make up for for session that would have been held on Thursday. I am sure you will attend the same on the *EWYL Line tomorrow*

09/11/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hey Ta[piwa!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

13/12/23, 12:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofians, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL

20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Emotions ran high as the students shared their hopes and dreams, igniting a wave of anticipation. From wishes for kindness to dreams of adventure, the excitement was contagious! The air buzzed with the thrill of anticipation as the magic of Secret Santa bound hearts together in the spirit of giving. 🤗💫
So, dear student, *what do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this year*? 🌟🎄
