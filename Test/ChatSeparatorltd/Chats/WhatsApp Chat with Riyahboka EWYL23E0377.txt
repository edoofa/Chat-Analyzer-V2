In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

15/09/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa.

15/09/23, 5:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Are you still following the session Riyahboka?*

15/09/23, 5:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is the last project we have.
There are only three projects that we cover.

When you come to India we do not conduct regular sessions. Rather we interact over video calls twice a week.
15/09/23, 5:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that. And that is why we will finish our discussion on the projects in the next five minutes.
15/09/23, 5:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When you exams will come near we will put our program on hold.
15/09/23, 5:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Do not worry about that.
15/09/23, 5:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, I have been explaining both the projects today so that I do not have to meet you everyday.

15/09/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Riyahboka. Do not worry at all. 
Is it possible for you to be available tomorrow at 8:00am?
15/09/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We will finish our discussion within 10 minutes and then you can focus on your studies.
15/09/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is that alright?

16/09/23, 8:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.

           So, are you ready to start our session?
16/09/23, 8:24 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
16/09/23, 8:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: How are you Riyahboka?
16/09/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 786 2520: Fine thanks and you
16/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am also good. Thank you so much for asking.
16/09/23, 8:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/09/23, 8:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
16/09/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 786 2520: Haaa I am not sure that my headmaster will have time because he is always busy
16/09/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 786 2520: Isn’t you said the project has no due date
16/09/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, there is no due date for the projects.
16/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes I don’t want to lie I am having a lot of pressure because if I fail you will be the same people who won’t give me the scholarship <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Riyahboka please do not feel burdened at all. We are almost done with discussing how the third project is done.
Right now we are just discussing the project which we will be done in next  five minutes.

After that you will be aware about what these projects are. Now that you have your exams coming in you can focus on that. But, in the meanwhile you can alsi connect with your friends or anyone you meet.
16/09/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
16/09/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: I completely understand how you're feeling right now, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Let's take a moment to break this down logically. First, take a deep breath and relax. You've got this! 😊

16/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 786 2520: It’s not the exams it’s the pressure I am getting from school and you ,during my free time I am supposed to be writing school work and yet you start with your projects
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Riyahboka.
16/09/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: That also i understand. Now if you want we can finish this last segment of the last project. And you will feel relaxed.
16/09/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me know if you want that?
16/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 786 2520: Let’s finish
16/09/23, 9:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Noted.
16/09/23, 9:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

*Kindly excuse me for any inconvenience. I'd like to inform you that I encountered a technical glitch due to which last week's activity was shared again with you. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.*

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

*After having a keen observation, I would like to re-iterate a few important pointers that will help us in having a smooth session.*
Recently, there have been some irregularities in your attendance for our sessions on the EWYL Line from your end.
Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Monday and Thursday, from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.
*Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please write Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.
19/12/23, 1:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Session Focus:* During our sessions, we discuss project updates, delve into the Wednesday Lesson, and share responses to the Saturday activity. Ensure sharing your understanding and responses before we start our sessions.
*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.

Another quick little Update.

There is *no deadline for the project.*
There is *no order in which you have to do the project.*
There is *no limit on how much you have to do a project.*
There is *no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.*

It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
