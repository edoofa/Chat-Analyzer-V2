24/04/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa created group "Rudorwashe EWYL23E0128"
24/04/23, 9:09 am - You were added
15/09/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Hello Ms Jasmine!
Its lovely to hear from you after a long time😅
I am doing well thank you. I hope you are doing well too!

I understand your concerns Ms Jasmine. 

Considering that my exams are around the corner(9 October to 29 October)would it be possible to take up option 1 where my parents can attend the sessions on
Monday,tuesday and Wednesday from 1.30pm to 2.30pm?
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Ok, cool, let's proceed
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Yes, these are academic goal and gaining practical experience through the journey
18/09/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Rudorwashe is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Well understood and appreciated
18/09/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Well noted, thanks for sharing
18/09/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Thanks for inroducing us to the Head of EWYL team, Ms. Sanjana
18/09/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Thanks for introducing us to the Head Coach, Ms. Davi
18/09/23, 3:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Rudorwashe to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
18/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 271 2858: This is noted. Please note that Rudorwashe will be sitting for her 'A' level exams from 9th to 29th October and can earnestly start on the sessions after 29th Oct.
18/09/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I want you to hear the introduction and share it with Rudorwashe.
18/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 271 2858: That's ok
18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 271 2858: I have read and understood the lettee, very inspiring, thanks
18/09/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Rudorwashe’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
18/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 271 2858: The 3 objectives are clear, thanks

19/09/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that.

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.

Make sure that you are on time.
24/11/23, 8:06 am - +263 71 545 9774: 1.Project 1 is Corporate Alliances. Project 2 is called Community Building. Project 3 is African Reform Mission

2.Project 1 is about identifying local companies as well as decision makers in those companies then reaching out to them in order to share Edoofa's vision and mission in order to get them to sign a contract hence resulting in me helping Edoofa to build a network of companies and potential employers.

Project 2
Project 2 will require me to reach out to my personal and extended networks in order to help them know their future can be bright as well through Edoofa. 

Project 3
Project 3 involves reaching out to schools, identifying and enlisting decision makers and recording contact details in google datasheets. It involves influencing students who are about to or have just graduated to enrol on the Edoofa educational program and become part of Edoofa community. These African students will have an opportunity to learn and copy good practices in India and in turn apply them to their communities
24/11/23, 8:07 am - +263 71 545 9774: Good Morning Ms Jasmine. Noted with thanks
24/11/23, 8:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done Rudorwashe,

24/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 545 9774: Thank you Ms Jasmine
24/11/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/11/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 545 9774: I have listened to the audio twice,thank you
24/11/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 545 9774: From the audio,I got that through the projects, I will be able to interact with digitally active companies. At the moment, I should identify people in my community who are in the service sector and inform them about Edoofa and the earn while you learn program . Additionally having a LinkedIn account of my own is essential.
24/11/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Rudorwashe. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
24/11/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 545 9774: From the guide for searching companies,I got that when looking for companies I should look at the nature of the company, the scale of the company,the financial stability and the background of the company's founder. I should also look at the company's websites and social media. Additionally I should get more information about the company from LinkedIn and google .After identifying commendable companies, I should reach out to them.

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
08/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 545 9774: Noted , thank you
08/12/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

15/12/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
15/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I do remember, the one where I have to reach out to school heads in order for Edoofa to partner with schools
15/12/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
15/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I do agree Ms Jasmine

Take care, have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday at 8:30 am.
15/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 545 9774: Noted ,thank you Ms Jasmine!

18/12/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Many Indian families decorate their homes with colorful lights and ornaments, exchange gifts, attend church services, and enjoy festive meals with family and friends.
18/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 545 9774: That really sounds like a lot of fun. Families here also travel and visit new places hence its also actually difficult to reach school heads and other students because they are caught up with the hustle and bustle of the wonderful holiday
18/12/23, 9:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Now it is time to wrap up the session for today.*

Due to our incomplete session today, there's no need to worry. We'll compensate for it tomorrow. *Please ensure your punctuality for our session, scheduled from 8:30 am to 9:30 am.*

19/12/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 545 9774: Goodmorning Ms Jasmine
19/12/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yesterday, we were discussing Project 3

Would you happen to remember?
19/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I remember
19/12/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
19/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 545 9774: By school head are you referring to the headmaster of the school I was at?
19/12/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
19/12/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
19/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 545 9774: My school head is already connected to Edoofa so would contacting her again be necessary
19/12/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No, In this case you have to reach out to other school heads.
19/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 545 9774: Oh okay
19/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I am ready
19/12/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
