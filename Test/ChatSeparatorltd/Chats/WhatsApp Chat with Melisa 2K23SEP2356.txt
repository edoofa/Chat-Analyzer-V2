If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

06/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir
06/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thanks. I'm done
06/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thank you sir . The steps are clear
06/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thank you sir. It's very clear.
06/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 369 1162: So clear. Thank you sir
06/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to k now. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Yes sir
06/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
06/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Yes please

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
11/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Melisa !

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
11/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir
11/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, May I know if you are ready for the session?
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 369 3241: I make it happen  !  Good evening sir. Very sorry sir, for the past few days there was no network.
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening! No need to worry; I understand that technical issues can sometimes disrupt communication. I'm glad we can continue our session now.
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.

Question 3 

The relationship between sociology and Economics is that Sociology primarily studies about society and social relashionships where as m economics studies about wealthy and choice. Sociology and Economics share a profoundly interwoven and complex relationship. Economics primarily focuses on the economic aspects of human existence. While Sociology takes a broader perspective studying in it's entirety, which includes the economic dimension, encompasses the examinations of the various aspects of human social life, including economic interactions, as well as legal , political, religious and cultural elements. In contrasts, economics concentrates on how idividuals allocate scarce resources to fulfill their needs and desires and it also investigated how economic dynamic impact society.
17/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Question 4

Institutions in society can have both positive and negative effects. Performing essential functions and sometimes favouring the powerful . They can also contribute to the variation of life chances by class, gender and ethricity. Institutions can play a role in perpetuating or challenging existing inequalities. For example, certain instructions may have biases or discriminatory practices that disadvantages certain groups. However instructions can also work towards creating a more equitable society by implementing policies that addresses discrimination and promote social justice . There are five institutions that are : Educational institution, Government institution, Economic institution , Religious and Social institution . For example, Educational institution   plays  a critical role in shaping individuals into responsible citizens and agents of positive charge  in the world.

18/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 369 3241: I am done. I don't know if there are some questions which I missed.
18/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to fill out this form as well?
18/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Okay. Thank you
18/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Question 2

A social structure can indeed constrain individual  action or society. Societies have structures that impact on individuals and society. These include religion, politics, families, schools to mention but a few. 
Different religions have teachings that all members under that religion follow without question. Examples include way of dressing and food prohibitions.

Politics, especially in third world countries prescribes the dos and donts. For example people can be denied food handouts and farming imputs because they belong to an opposition party.

Cultural beliefs are within society and they prescribe certain beliefs that shape human behavior. An example in some is when one gives birth to twins. Traditionally that is viewed as a bad omen. Both children must be killed.
In some societies and religions, marriage is prescribed. One cannot Mary a person outside his or her religion. Doing so is viewed as a serious transgression to the norms and values. 


One's behavior,dress, food and way of life is prescribed by society. Doing the opposite is strictly not tolerated. Trying to do otherwise is just as good as licking .
18/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Sorry for the late responses sir I started my examinations so I am a bit busy and my network is a bit low
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 050 5370: 1.	The relation between Sociology and Economics

Sociology and economics share a profoundly interwoven and complex relationship.* Economics primarily focuses on the economic aspects of human existence, while sociology takes a broader perspective, studying society in its entirety, which includes the economic dimension as one facet of this expansive field of social science. Sociology encompasses the examination of various aspects of human social life, including economic interactions, as well as legal, political, religious, and cultural elements. In contrast, economics concentrates on how individuals allocate scarce resources to fulfil their needs and desires, and it also investigates how economic dynamics impact society. These two disciplines, sociology and economics, are intricately linked, mutually influencing each other as they collaborate to explore and address both social and economic challenges.
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 050 5370: 2.	*What is the role of institutions in society – do they perform positive functions, or simply work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerless? elaborate with example
*It is important to note that, Institutions serve as the bedrock of society, as they supply the fundamental prerequisites for life. They are crucial instruments for regulating and governing social behaviour. The roles of institutions encompass streamlining individual actions and tasks, providing a means of societal control, and contributing to the overall maintenance of order within society. Institutions are integral components of the social fabric of a community, fostering organization and stability. Their primary function is to oversee individual behaviouthical standards.
Most importantly, Institutions are well-established organizations, customs, laws, or principles designed to serve specific societal purposes, exhibiting longevity and enduring through time. Their pivotal role in society is undeniable. Hence, my belief that institutions perform positive and essential functions that greatly impact the well-being of societies. There are five overarching categories to consider, that can assist in understating the vita

23/10/23, 6:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Melisa!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time. Regarding the SOP, it is alright.

23/10/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Melisa!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
25/10/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Melisa!

I hope you are doing well today. I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currently available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Yes sir I am ready
25/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I a happy to hear that. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences.
25/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 369 3241: I understand,
25/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 369 3241: For sure, our counselor  has done his job very well. We understood
25/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Yes please sir
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Noted sir
25/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust you've had a wonderful day so far. I apologize for not being available earlier as it was beyond my designated hours. However, I am now fully prepared to kickstart our session.

30/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir. Yes I am available
30/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are caught up on our previous conversation about the admission process so that we can continue moving forward with the same?
30/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Sorry  sir, you may say it again clearly so that we move together nicely
30/10/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly,  I wanted to know if you remember what we talked about earlier regarding the admission process, so we can continue discussing it.
30/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Sure sir, I  still remember but  just in case I might be mistaken
30/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Today our  network is so challenging so just be patient
30/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
01/11/23, 5:42 am - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you sir . Good time
01/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir
02/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Melisa.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed.

I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir
02/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Yes sir we are ready
02/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
02/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thank you so much. So by when are we expected to have paid the registration fees
02/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be required to be paid once you have received the offer letter. Shall we proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Yes please. How are you Sir
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Wow! Quite inspiring. Thanks
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
02/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thank you sir. This i accepted in totality
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
02/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

02/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
02/11/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 369 3241: We have read and understood, let's proceed.
03/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Melisa.

I hope you are having a fine afternoon today. I was not able to respond to your message in a timely manner as it was past my available hours. I would like to let you know that I will be available for our session a little later today as I will be occupied with a meeting with the admission team. Please relax for now, and I will respond to you as soon as I am done with the meeting.
03/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you sir .
Noted
03/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student. I hope you are having a fine evening today. 

I would like to let you know that I will not be available this evening due to an unforeseen event that just came up, requiring my immediate attention. In order to make up for this session, I shall now be scheduling our session for tomorrow morning from 8:30 AM onwards. Please excuse me for the inconvenience. Have a great evening, and please share my warm regards with your lovely family as well.
03/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 369 1162: That's okay sir. Thanks for communicating. Stay blessed
03/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Good evening sir. Noted  with thanks
04/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 050 5370: Yes am ready sir thank you
04/11/23, 9:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
04/11/23, 9:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
04/11/23, 9:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
04/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 050 5370: I got you sir. I understood
04/11/23, 10:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/11/23, 10:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/11/23, 10:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 050 5370: We are in the same track sir
04/11/23, 11:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
04/11/23, 11:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 050 5370: I heard you sir
04/11/23, 12:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/11/23, 12:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/11/23, 12:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/11/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Noted sir. I am following up
05/11/23, 2:19 am - +263 78 050 5370: It is clear
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. I was not able to connect with you at the moment that you were online as it was past my available hours and it was the weekend.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 050 5370: I am ready sir
06/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Can you explain further sir
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
06/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes I understand now sir . Thank you so much
06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Oh yes I agree sir
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Very clear sir
06/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir we may go on
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Oh what a benefit. Thank you sir. I understand
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 050 5370: It's now clear sir
06/11/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir am impatiently waiting for it
06/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
06/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you so much for the support sir
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you sir
21/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 050 5370: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi Kapoor and she has scheduled my session ftom November 7

15/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 050 5370: How are you sir. Am very happy and glad to receive the offer letter
15/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 050 5370: I am ready for the session
15/12/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Clear sir
15/12/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 050 5370: 1.900 USD
2.3 years (6 semesters)
3.700 usd
4.100 USD
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you sir
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 050 5370: We are on the same path sir thank you
15/12/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir  and I am thankful
15/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 050 5370: It is clear sir
18/12/23, 12:47 pm - +91 93548 83068 joined using this group's invite link
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Melisa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for being patient with us. May I know if you are currently available at the moment so that we can proceed with the session?
18/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir I am
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes  sir
18/12/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes please
18/12/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/12/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/12/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir it's clear thank you
18/12/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/12/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/12/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 369 1162: I don't stay in Harare. I stay in Rushinga to the North Eastern part of Zimbabwe
19/12/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Good evening Sir. Iam ready
19/12/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 369 1162: Thanks a lot Sir. Please may you kindly send his details
19/12/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/12/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/12/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
19/12/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you sir. I think I would rather prefer to use Mr Shorwi's as I used to do if you don't mind for me to use the Ecocash. I will  add the Ecocash charges. Waiting to hear from you. Thank you
19/12/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you. Good time
20/12/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Melisa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly I am sharing that now.
