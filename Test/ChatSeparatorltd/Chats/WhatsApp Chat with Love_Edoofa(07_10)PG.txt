We have received the application Love for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
10/10/23, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Love,  It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Mrs Chawo?*
10/10/23, 2:01 pm - +265 881 99 02 00: Soryy i was a little occupied with some work.                         
1) I applied for the Edoofa Scholarship program because I am motivated to pursue higher education and further develop my skills and knowledge. The scholarship program provides a great opportunity for me to access quality education and guidance, which I believe will significantly contribute to my personal growth and career prospects. Additionally, I am encouraged by the program's emphasis on community development and giving back, as it aligns with my own values and aspirations.

2) From my understanding, the Edoofa Scholarship program aims to provide financial assistance and mentorship to deserving students who have limited access to educational opportunities. It is a comprehensive program that not only covers tuition fees but also offers career counseling, skill development, and internships to help students succeed academically and professionally. By partnering with universities and companies, the program ensures that students receive a holistic education and relevant industry exposure. Overall, the program strives to empower individuals, transform lives, and create a positive impact on society through education.
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Love, Please let me add more information to it.
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

10/10/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.


*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - +265 881 99 02 00: I will be delighted to get that opportunity.

10/10/23, 4:04 pm - +265 881 99 02 00: Firstly i hold a baschelors degree in public health,iam a self motivated individual, iam an open minded person who always aim at learning news skills for self development and mindset growth.My greatest strength is my problem-solving skills. I pride myself on being able to quickly and efficiently analyze and solve complex problems by considering different perspectives. This skill allows me to remain effective even in a stressful situationprefer to work prepared and according to a well-defined plan. This sometimes works to my disadvantage, because it's impossible to always be prepared. My weakness is that I sometimes take on too many activities at once. This can sometimes hinder the quality of my work.in the near future i would like to manage international projects. I have strong leadership skills and communication skills that I would like to continue developing. My long-term career goal is to become a program manager and manage several projects at the same time.

Let's have a discussion tonight. Shall we begin?
22/10/23, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Love, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
