Would you like to share a quick introduction?
10/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I am so excited to know about you!
10/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 621 9940: <Media omitted>

10/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 621 9940: I am literally an open book.

 Educationally, l am a very curious person, open to knowing more than l already do, hence why science has been a field of interest for me, because it satiates my hunger. I have neva really had much trouble getting through school hence I consider myself a little more above average. I am not afraid of hardwork and putting in the extra hours. I wish to study something valuable in the Medical field because l think it would interest me. Interacting with people giving them hope and saving lives is what l feel would give me a reason to wake up everyday because it would be more than just a career to me. My weakenesses are that l easily get bored hence accounting for my fairly average levels of concentration. My hobbies include gaming nd my interest for sport cannot be ignored. I grew up in a nuclear family. This is where l learnt all the morals nd principles which have made me a upright girl l am today
10/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Victoria! I really like your outfit!🌻
10/08/23, 10:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much, Victoria, for introducing yourself so gracefully!

10/08/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 621 9940: Sorry l meant session
10/08/23, 11:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: We've gone ahead and scheduled your sessions from Monday to Friday, starting at 8:30 AM and running until 9:30 AM. And let me tell you, I just know you're going to blow us away with your incredible energy and enthusiasm every single day!
11/08/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my proud Edoofian!

14/08/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

Apart from being family oriented they are ambitious. 
They enjoy going out, sight seeing and they have been together for 20 years now.
14/08/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772332464 

How are you today?
14/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 233 2464: Well thanks and yourself?
14/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am good! It is nice connecting with you.
14/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 233 2464: Noted thanks..
You can share the objectives please.
14/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 621 9940: Nooo, if u may kindly please elaborate on what these objectives are
14/08/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/08/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 621 9940: Thank you Ma'am Ananya.
I understand the objectives well
14/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 233 2464: Thanks. Im in love with your Edoofa program, i see it taking our kids to another level, especially in terms of improving their, knowledge, skills and independence.

May i leave you to Thandeka if that's fine with you.
14/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 233 2464: Great work.
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 621 9940: Nice to know them both, Ms Deepali nd Ms Davi...
I really hope we will work well together
14/08/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: - At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Victoria?
14/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 621 9940: It's music to my ears.
It's worth looking forward to
14/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can share your understaning in our next session. Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
14/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 621 9940: Thank you so much, am already counting down to tomorrow....

15/08/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟

18/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 621 9940: So above, we were told how the EWYL program works and it was explained to us how it also benefits us..

21/08/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.

23/08/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
We can do that via platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly Linked In.
23/08/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will need you to create your accounts on all these platforms and share your usernames with me in our session in the format mentioned below:
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
Linked In Id Link:
23/08/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, When you have created the accounts on all these platforms, You can use the search features provided on all these platforms to look for companies that suit our criteria.
23/08/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: For example, I talk about LinkedIn, You can type Education in the search bar once you open it.
Not just this, on Google, you can simply type, ‘Small scale Educational companies in African countries
After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.
23/08/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 621 9940: Oky thank you ma'am for today's task
23/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 621 9940: Will it be possible if l handed it by tomorrow.
The network during the day is something else this side
23/08/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, I understand.
23/08/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Victoria, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
23/08/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 621 9940: I have listened to it ma'am
23/08/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 621 9940: Generally it's is more like l am recruiting other students. L am spreading the awareness of the presence of communities such as Edoofa to everyone l know
23/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 621 9940: However l have a question ma'am
23/08/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Victoria?
23/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 621 9940: In the audio, it is said that l should bring a maximum of 10students on board.

Hence what is the minimum.

And secondly, in Zimbabwe the exams have not beeen completed yet, hence does this mean l will only do the project then
23/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: There is no limit, Victoria! Personally, I believe it is the easiest way. You can do it while you are in\ school.
23/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 621 9940: Oky, thank you ma'am
23/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

23/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
23/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 621 9940: 😊thank you
23/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 621 9940: Thank you ma'am
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
23/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

23/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 621 9940: Oky thank u ma'am
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

23/08/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 621 9940: I am supposed to approach school heads and inform then about Edoofa and the Edoofa director and head will share information over a meeting
23/08/23, 9:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations . However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
23/08/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 621 9940: Yes, may u kindly send the cover letter mentioned in the audio, which is meant to pave way for me to communicate with the school heads

There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.

24/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 621 9940: I am not at a school currently Ma'am.

24/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 621 9940: Yes.
24/08/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.

24/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
24/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 621 9940: In Zimbabwe, schools are currently closed, and will only resume in September, hence as easy as it may be for me to approach school heads, they may be unavailable for meetings. However l will try.

25/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, dear!
25/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
25/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
25/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
25/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
25/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 621 9940: 🔊yessssssssssssssssssss Ma'am 😂☺️☺️☺️☺️
25/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
25/08/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 621 9940: This is getting me all hyped up, in this 21st century all these skills are literally wat makes the world go round
25/08/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
25/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 621 9940: We are moving together Ma'am
25/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
25/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 621 9940: Understood ma'am
25/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 621 9940: However l do have a challenge l would like to communicate to you about
