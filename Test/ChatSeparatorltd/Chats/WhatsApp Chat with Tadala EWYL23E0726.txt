18/10/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tadala!

Shall we move forward with our discussion?🛩️
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Hello can we please reschedule our session for 8pm to 9pm
18/10/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tadala, I genuinely appreciate your commitment to continuing with your EWYL sessions. However, I must inform you that the time you've proposed isn't feasible for me.
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Alright then we shall resume at 8:30am tomorrow
19/10/23, 8:31 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Hello
19/10/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tadala!

How are you doing today?
23/10/23, 9:11 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Hello im great thanks and how are you
23/10/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: I've noticed that you haven't been attending your EWYL sessions on time. Is there a specific challenge you're facing that you'd like to share?
23/10/23, 9:40 am - +265 997 39 00 17: We are having electricity issues so I can't charge my phone on Time
23/10/23, 9:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that you are facing these challenges, and it's not easy. However, attending these EWYL sessions is crucial for your learning and development.

I suggest trying to keep your phone charged during the session by:

Charging your phone before the session starts.
Using a power bank if possible.
Reducing unnecessary phone usage before the session to save battery.
This way, you can make the most out of our sessions without worrying about your phone's battery running out.
25/10/23, 8:47 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Hello
25/10/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tadala!

How are you doing?
25/10/23, 8:55 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Im good and you
25/10/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/10/23, 9:00 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Alright thanks for the introductions
25/10/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/10/23, 9:04 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Sounds very interesting
25/10/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound,?
25/10/23, 9:10 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Those are good plans can't wait to achieve them
25/10/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
25/10/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 9:24 am - +265 997 39 00 17: Very interesting and inspiring
25/10/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our session here, and I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects!
25/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share your understaning of the project before your next session.

09/11/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: _*Exciting news*_

I'll be away from 10th to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
14/11/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning!

As a new day unfolds, embrace the opportunities it brings. Let's dive into our session with enthusiasm and dedication. Remember, 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count.' - Winston Churchill.

I hope this message finds you well. We have noticed that Tadala has not been attending her EWYL sessions lately. Despite sending reminders and messages, there has been no response from her. May I ask if everything is alright?

As her mentor, I am genuinely concerned about her progress and well-being. I would appreciate it if you could provide some insights into whether she is facing any challenges.

Your assistance in this matter is highly valued. Thank you for your attention to this concern.

I hope you are doing well. I want to highlight that, despite constant reminders and messages, you have crossed the deadline for completing your orientation with me.

Please remember that you signed a document committing to finishing your orientation program with me to proceed with your scholarship procedures.

Today being the last day, it would be great if we could either connect today or schedule our session for the day. This way, I can ensure a hassle-free and progressive journey for you.
17/11/23, 9:28 am - +265 995 73 92 90: Noted with thanks.
We are all in 3 different places but will remind Tadala to avail herself as I might be in transit the time the session starts.
20/12/23, 9:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @265995739290 @265997390017 @23276398822 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. I think we should connect today and discuss if something is there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. What do you think?
