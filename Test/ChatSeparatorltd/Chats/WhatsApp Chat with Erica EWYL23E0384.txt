Let me share a short clip about myself.
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
22/08/23, 12:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 333 0313: It is such a pleasure knowing you better Ms Tenzin.

29/08/23, 8:01 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
There are two-time slots you can choose from.
8:30 am to 9:30 am or 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm
29/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 333 0313: From 1:30 to 2:30 is better
29/08/23, 10:58 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Let us connect today.
29/08/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 333 0313: Ok
29/08/23, 1:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: It is time for your session.
29/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I'm available
29/08/23, 1:48 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 333 0313: No
29/08/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Understood, I'm following
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay
Its great to be working with them through the journey
29/08/23, 2:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Erica?
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 333 0313: That's sounds great and attainable
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Right its interesting
29/08/23, 3:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/08/23, 3:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tomorrow marks a festive day in India 🇮🇳 – a joyous celebration of the special bond shared between brothers and sisters, known as Raksha Bandhan. 🎉 As a result, our organization will remain closed for the day. 
Hence, we will not have the sessions tomorrow.
29/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay noted
31/08/23, 1:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
31/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Afternoon ma'am 
I'm fine and you
31/08/23, 1:40 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am fine, Thank you.
31/08/23, 1:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you have gone through the newsletter?
31/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Yes I did
31/08/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I can't choose 
All the sections sounds interesting
31/08/23, 2:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
31/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I noticed it, I really wish for that. 
Its so amazing to be one day celebrated in that section
31/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
31/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 333 0313: You can go ahead
31/08/23, 2:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
31/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 333 0313: The EWYL team has Ms David who is the head coach and she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. 
We also blessed with the Head of Department, Ms Deepali. She will be monitoring all our group conversations and she will be there whenever we need guidance. And I have you, Ms Tenzin,my mentor who is helping me in achieving my goals and unlocking my full potential
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, You are right.
31/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 333 0313: You set 3 goals for the EWYL journey 

The first one is making sure that my academic journey is on point. 
Then secondly making sure that I'm given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India. 
The lastly, working towards achieving the objective which is I'm evolving and learning  skills to prepare myself for the real world work place and helping me grow holistically
31/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Newsletter
31/08/23, 3:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Please answer the last question.
31/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 333 0313: What I understood by the meaning of Hall of Inspiration is that it is a collection of inspirings from proud Edoofians that would make us step out of our comfort zones and letting our dedications be the driving force in shaping our brighter futures. There is also the issue of building a society full of young and anspiring students
31/08/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your answers showcase a strong grasp of the concepts we have been discussing. Your ability to articulate your thoughts and ideas clearly and concisely is truly impressive. Keep up the excellent work.
31/08/23, 3:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: That wraps up our communication for today. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead! If you have any more questions or need assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!

01/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Ok noted, I will let you know once I'm done
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know why are you so late in responding?
01/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I'm at school so I'm trying to balance the two
01/09/23, 2:40 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Erica.
01/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I'm sorry plus the network is very low
01/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I'm done reading the document
01/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please share your understanding.
01/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 333 0313: The document is giving us brief explanation on how the EWYL program will help us achieve our career  goals and make us focus on working towards securing a bright future for ourselves. It also explains about the values and skills we will obtain through the program so that we get ready for whatever is coming in the future. The document explains about the 2 projects we should be involved in. The first one which is corporate alliance and the other one is community building
01/09/23, 3:40 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am happy with your understanding!

How are you today?
04/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Afternoon maam
Im good and how are you
04/09/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am good, Thank you.
04/09/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
04/09/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I'm done
04/09/23, 3:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know why did it take so long?
04/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 333 0313: It took me so long to download the audio, I think its the network
04/09/23, 3:17 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
04/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 333 0313: First, I have a question
04/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I did not get the name of the application we are supposed to download from the Play store
04/09/23, 3:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: The name of application is LinkdIn.
04/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay thank you
04/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 333 0313: So, the audio is giving brief explanation on the two projects. The first one which is corporate alliance, which can help us gain and understand the market we plan to enter in the future so that we begin to get ready for it at an early stage. In this project, I have to identity Digital companies and technology related companies within my country. I should share with them how Edoofa is helping me develop skills for my future when it comes to employment. We can download the LinkdIn app that allows us to search for companies and to connect with the employees. After connecting with the companies, I have to arrange a meeting  for them with Edoofa.
04/09/23, 3:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: Erica, I only explained one project and not two.
04/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Infact, the audio is on Corporate Alliance
04/09/23, 3:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am happy with your understanding, Let us connect tomorrow.
04/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Yes, I realised it later 
That's why I typed below that the audio is only on Corporate Alliance
04/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay thank you
Have a great day ahead
05/09/23, 1:27 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!

I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

05/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 333 0313: This document gives information on how to search for companies. To  identify the right companies, I should for the following factors
*nature of the company 
*scale of the company 
*financial stability 
*background of the founder etc. 
There are also steps I should follow that go hand in hand with identifying the above factors. Step 1 is for searching.I can use the LinkedIn app. Step 2 and 3,I have to study about the company to gain more knowledge and on step 4 I need to check different social media pages of the company so that I gain idea on the activities done by the companies. On step 5,I have to study the background of the founder and other core members of  the companies. Then the last step is reaching out to the companies and request for connection
05/09/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know what Erica, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
05/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 333 0313: I left out the idea that we will be searching for the type of companies that suit my requirement.
05/09/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: You have explained very nicely.
05/09/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

Maam I don't think I will be able to attend the sessions every day... I am weeks away from my final examinations of which the pressure is too much. Sometimes I don't even get to touch the phone. I need to work extra hard for better results. 
I'm sorry

So won't it affect anything if I keep my sessions on hold
18/09/23, 8:17 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
 I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 1:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!

I'm available today
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay maam
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Noted
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: Mentor-  *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*

*STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay
20/09/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Okay, I understand
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

20/09/23, 2:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

20/09/23, 2:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 333 0313: Olk
20/09/23, 3:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

In this project, I have to reach out to local schools in my area and let them know about the Edoofa program. I can make a list of these schools and my school should be one of those schools on the list. I can reach out to the principal or headmasters of these schools and notify them about the program. I have to let them know why I joined Edoofa in the first place, how l planned my future and then share with them the program details. I have to ask them if they can attend an online meeting with the Edoofa Director. After that I have to share the contact details of the principals with My Mentor.
22/09/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
22/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 333 0313: No questions maam
22/09/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

 As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. I think we should connect today and discuss if something is there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. What do you think?
