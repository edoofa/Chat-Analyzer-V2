19/10/23, 1:51 pm - +27 74 716 3677: 🙋🏿‍♂️
19/10/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - +27 74 716 3677: My greatest wish
19/10/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Galanaswi, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +27 74 716 3677: *My long term goals*
Becoming a mentor
Becoming a leader
Earning my degree
Building new skills
Building a network 
Becoming a thought leader 

The EWYL program will help me manage my financial responsibilities and also supplement my funds while working towards my long term goals
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It's truly inspiring to see your commitment to long-term success and personal growth. Your aspirations to become a mentor, a leader, and a thought leader, while earning your degree and building a strong network, showcase your dedication. The "Earn While You Learn" program is a smart choice, not only to manage your finances but also to support your journey toward these impressive goals.
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/10/23, 2:17 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Can you enlighten me on the objectives you mean
19/10/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/10/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/10/23, 2:22 pm - +27 74 716 3677: that's good and nice to know 😊
19/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/10/23, 2:26 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Okay thank you '
 greetings to them 👏🏿
19/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Even they are delighted to meet you!
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
19/10/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Thank you

20/10/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Galanaswi and parents!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
20/10/23, 1:43 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Greetings 👋🏾
Yes we can
20/10/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Were you able to see the video shared yesterday?
20/10/23, 1:45 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Yes i did 😁
20/10/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you grasped about me?
20/10/23, 1:53 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Like you said it is your aim to see us Edoofians as our mentor developing, growing and becoming successful. You like people who are curious to learn and add new skills to their knowledge
20/10/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much, means a lot!
20/10/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
20/10/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 2:09 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Im done it's interesting 😁
20/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
20/10/23, 2:17 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Yes each section has its own taste but for me the 3 quotes made my day 😊
20/10/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, they are indeed amazing, and I personally also like them the most!
20/10/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Galanaswi?
20/10/23, 2:24 pm - +27 74 716 3677: that's awesome, i swear these goals you have set for me are key to my success 🫶🏾
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes definitely, you will achieve a lot!
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 2:26 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Noted

20/10/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - +27 74 716 3677: thank you so much
Have a blessed weekend ♥️
20/10/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You too, Galanaswi!
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Galanaswi and parents!
How are you?
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will commence our sessions starting from Wednesday onward. 😊 Please note that I won't be available on Monday due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: While Dussehra is a unique and culturally significant Indian festival, it can be related to the spirit of celebration and community found in many festivals around the world, including Zimbabwe. 🎉 Zimbabwe has its own rich tapestry of festivals, such as the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) and traditional celebrations like the Harare Agricultural Show. 🎪🌾 These festivals, like Dussehra, bring people together in a spirit of unity and celebration, fostering a sense of togetherness and cultural pride. 🤝

01/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Galanaswi, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Alright
07/11/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/11/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Galanaswi/Saloni/7NOV2023*
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/11/23, 4:58 pm - +27 74 716 3677: 👏🏿👏🏿
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - +27 74 716 3677: Yes we can
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

14/11/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
14/11/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

16/11/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello and good afternoon!

What are you most excited to discuss or work on during our session? Your input is key, and I'm looking forward to a dynamic and engaging conversation.

18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.

20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Emotions ran high as the students shared their hopes and dreams, igniting a wave of anticipation. From wishes for kindness to dreams of adventure, the excitement was contagious! The air buzzed with the thrill of anticipation as the magic of Secret Santa bound hearts together in the spirit of giving. 🤗💫
So, dear student, *what do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this year*? 🌟🎄
