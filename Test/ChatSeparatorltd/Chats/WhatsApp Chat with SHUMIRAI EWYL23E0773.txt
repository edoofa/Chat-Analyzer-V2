Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply. There was some technical issue in my devise.
Now that your examinations have started already, and I do not want to prevent you from giving your best there. Hence, I would like to conduct a three-day long fastrack session that can be attended by your parents on your behalf.
And then we can put your program on hold, until your exams get over.

18/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing me about that dear parent. I have full faith that Shumirai will perform really well.
18/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank for your encouraging words
18/10/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand Shumirai's  situation, and I know Shumairai have the exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to complete your session within 2 days.

This is the Fastrack version of the session which will be completed within 2 days, and this can either be attended by you or your parents on your behalf.

*Do let me know once you are done reading this, so that we can start the FastTrack session.*
19/10/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning, Shumirai! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
19/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 647 6095: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 647 6095: Morning Shumirai is writing exam this morning soon after exam she will communicate
19/10/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing me about the same.
Sinc she is busy writing the exams, is it possible for you to attend the session on her behalf?
19/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 455 9977: Morning, yes we are ready go ahead
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Shumirai* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Shumirai* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 10:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion ?
19/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you I read the newsletter and I hope Shumirai will read it. It's so inspiring
19/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: We have network challenge here causing the delays in delivering messages
19/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 455 9977: Yes I am following the discussion
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: I can completely understand that.
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Shumirai*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Shumirai* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Shumirai* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you I went through the document ma'am
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, thank you foe letting me about that.
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Shumirai* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Shumirai* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once *Shumirai* is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

 In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
 All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact) -   +91 98107 89170
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*

20/10/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great, thank you for updating me regarding the same.
20/10/23, 11:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Shumirai* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
20/10/23, 11:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I parent of , *<NAME>*, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME>  would like to inform you that *Student* won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because of exams that start from _ to __ (date) and she/he will reach out to my mentor, *Ms. Sharda* as soon as the exams get over.

These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I hope you are doing well
To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it is our session time are you ready for it?

24/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Shumirai*

Let's start our session with a bit of inspiration:
*"Your attitude determines your direction."*

Now, let's talk about this quote. It means that the way you approach things in life can shape where you're headed. Having a positive mindset and facing challenges with determination can lead to great things.

01/12/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
01/12/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
01/12/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
01/12/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

04/12/23, 1:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Shumirai

How are you doing?
*As we embark on this session together, let's draw inspiration from the words of Albert Einstein*: '*You never fail until you stop trying 'May this quote ignite our motivation and set the tone for a productive and empowering session.* Let's dive in and make the most of our time together!
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 110 5343: how are you
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am good, thank you so much for asking.
04/12/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly share the answers of these questions.
04/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Q1.Chinhoyi 2 High....They have not connected with EDOOFA yet
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Q2.
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 110 5343: when reaching to the heads ..firstly I will introduce myself and then share the EDOOFA vision with them about how I came to know about EDOOFA, The registration process and how EDOOFA will help me to plan for my future career
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Q3. Mashonaland West
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am

04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
