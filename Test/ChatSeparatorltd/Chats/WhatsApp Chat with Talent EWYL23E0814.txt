07/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 677 6631: The other project which is Community Building suggests that a student must connect with their personal and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be a part of the Edoofa programme
07/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Talent. I’m happy with your understanding.
07/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
07/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then l understand
07/11/23, 4:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay so l'm done reading the documents  and it stated out pointers that l need to use when looking for the right company to partner associate with Edoofa , Factors l need to consider when selecting a company are the nature of the company which is the type of services the company provides
07/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Then there's the scale of the company which is basically the size of the company it shouldn't be too small or too big

Financial stability which is basically a background check of the company's funding updates
07/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Talent, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
07/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

14/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I'll definitely do my best to be as attentive as possible
14/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I have acknowledge the form
14/11/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay then everything is clear for me
14/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Talent/Saloni/14NOV2023*
14/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
14/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Wow this is well thought out I'll definitely get to creating the group
14/11/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
14/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Thank you for your time Ms Saloni it was a really wonderful session
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!

15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share about this?
15/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Well that's true
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 677 6631: No l'm still gathering the numbers
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries!
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
15/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Okay lemme me listen to the audio
15/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, do let me know once you have listen it.
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I have listened to the audio and it seems like a wonderful project for sure cause l have the opportunity to make my former teachers proud as well as give other students a chance to join the Edoofa programme

Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Thank you so much
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!

16/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Yes we may
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Talent, I hope you are aware that punctuality is a trait of a disciplined student and I am very well aware as I have heard about you from your counselor and admissions team that you are a very bright kid, but not being punctual can portray a bad impression on the other person and I don't want that to happen with you. 
I hope you got my point.
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I definitely understand and l apologize for being late lm usually punctual but l'm facing network difficulties
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, let's continue with the session.
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project.

17/11/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 677 6631: Its all thanks to you Ms Saloni and thank you for being so patient with me
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 677 6631: This is a really good an unique practice because positive affirmations really work and give students a sense of belonging as well as being motivated
17/11/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you have said it so well!
I am looking forward for amazing sessions with you Talent!
17/11/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, do let me know.
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 677 6631: I'm done

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
