19/12/23, 12:29 pm - Kunal: Well noted
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Yes i am
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

19/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Ohhh thats nice
19/12/23, 12:37 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 713 7109: In 5 yrs i see myself as an educated individual,helpful to the community and to any who may cross my path and with a well orderly life with a house of my own and  a car and a stable job with a good income ...and i think being an Edoofian can be the ultimate stepping stone to achieving my goals and objective to my career.
19/12/23, 12:41 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Ohh not at the moment i havent done my research as of yet
19/12/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Thats resonable..
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
19/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
19/12/23, 4:09 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
19/12/23, 5:43 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 713 7109: Hie
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Kunal: Good morning
Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives. 

So I am here to continue with your application 

How are you this morning?
20/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Yes
20/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 713 7109: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 713 7109: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them, Augustine
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kunal: Please address the same and let us continue with the session
20/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Yes i think so very much
20/12/23, 12:53 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/12/23, 1:16 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
20/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 713 7109: Yes
