18/12/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
18/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 779 0133: Actually it's my Father....but for now he is not around due to work
18/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 779 0133: He is the one  helping me with this journey of prosperity
18/12/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's understandable. Whenever he's available,I would love to have a conversation with him. I wish you success on this journey of prosperity!

18/12/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/12/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
18/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 779 0133: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 779 0133: My long term goals are to be a successful lawyer who can serve her country in a righteous way....and this EWYL program will help me in making my payments affordable

The EWYL program is indeed a valuable opportunity that can support you in making your education more affordable. Wishing you success in your endeavors!🚀
18/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 779 0133: Thank you Ms Aditi😊
18/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 779 0133: No ....can you please tell me
18/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/12/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 779 0133: Okay I get you
18/12/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 779 0133: I am glad  to know that I am in good hands...and hope to talk to them
18/12/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, you will get the chance but currently they are unavailable as they are busy in team meetings.
18/12/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 779 0133: Yes it does
18/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

18/12/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 779 0133: Yes it is
18/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

18/12/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. Before we end our discussion for the day,I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again. *Are you ready for the questions?* <This message was edited>
