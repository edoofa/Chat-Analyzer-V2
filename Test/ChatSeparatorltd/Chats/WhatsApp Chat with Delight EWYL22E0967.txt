19/12/22, 10:59 am - You were added
15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
05/10/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 1:17 pm - +27 64 237 6673: I am sorry for the inconvienience , is it possible to connect with you from 1700 to 1900 hrs as of now l am very busy at work
05/10/23, 1:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would love to do that, but I hope you understand that there is a 3:30 hours of time difference and my working hours are 11:00 am to 8:00 pm (Indian Time) which is equivalent to *7:30 am to 4:30 pm (African time)*
05/10/23, 1:23 pm - +27 64 237 6673: So l don't know how we can solve it
11/10/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 256 5290: I got it now thank you
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 256 5290: I get it thank you maam
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Nice to meet you Miss Sanjana
12/10/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Okay maam
12/10/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Okay maam
12/10/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
12/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 256 5290: I get it maam
12/10/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them.
12/10/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Im done reading them
12/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Delight’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
12/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Thank you maam i got it
12/10/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
12/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 256 5290: Yes maam
12/10/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
16/10/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Delight and Parents* @263712565290 @27642376673 @263772215859 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 10:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263712565290 @27642376673 @263772215859*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Delight*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Delight* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
21/10/23, 5:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I hope you are in good health. *IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*

09/11/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

Our salaries are far below the required amount.
Sorry for the disappointment .
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm truly glad to see your transparency, a quality not always easily found. My sincere suggestion would be to have a candid discussion with the admissions officer, as they are likely to provide you with genuine alternative options.
