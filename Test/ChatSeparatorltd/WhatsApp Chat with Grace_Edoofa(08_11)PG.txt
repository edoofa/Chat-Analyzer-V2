We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *11:30 AM CAT tomorrow (08/11/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
14/11/23, 8:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Grace, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

14/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Hi. How are you?

I would love to connect with you. What am I supposed to do and when? I kept on waiting for the set dates I've been seeing in the group and I didn't see how I was supposed to initiate conversation. However, now that I know, what am I supposed to do?



Patiently waiting for your response
14/11/23, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Grace, you need to respond in the session as *Active Participation* is the main parameter.
14/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 196 9670: In this group?
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Good afternoon. Alright
I'll be waiting for the activities
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Grace, Let's continue the session, but before that, I would want you your active participation for 1-2 hours straight, so that we can proceed to Step 2

So, are you available?
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Yes. We can start right right away
15/11/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know when available.
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 196 9670: I am available
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Grace, Before commencing the discussion, Please note that as per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*
In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So I am making you the group admin. Please add them and let me know the names with which I should address them
15/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Okay. Before we proceed, what programs do I qualify for and the scholarships are eligible for edoofa only?
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you about every aspect in the further session, please add your parents first as they should also have a thorough understanding of the program from the start.
15/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 196 9670: OK. I'm just asking for insight first. Because I am already studying. So I'd rather not waste your time, if the programs offered are not of interest. I'd really appreciate a scholarship, but not one without my programme of interest
15/11/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Grace please note that this is the scholarship program and we do offer courses as per student's interests and subjects
15/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Yes ofcourse. I understand. I'm just asking for the outline of programmes available for scholarships
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding this, but prior to that I would like you to add as per our protocols
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 196 9670: OK
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 196 9670: Addressed as Mrs Mukonondera
