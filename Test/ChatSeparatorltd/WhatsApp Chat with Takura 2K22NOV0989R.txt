03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Takura. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

07/10/23, 11:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

To accommodate our conversation, I propose we meet at 3:00 PM on Monday. I hope this timing works well for you.

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
09/10/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?

09/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If  you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
12/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
13/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was hoping for a response from your end regarding our conversation about the admission process so that we can complete our discussion in due time. However, I did not receive a response from your end. Please let me know if you have received my message so that we can proceed and complete our session for the admission process.
18/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @27725799668 @263788872725 @27799088320
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
20/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Takura.
20/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*.


I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better.
