19/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 496 0893: First and it would be a previledge to be chosen as one of the Edoofa beneficiaries. Such an opportunity will put me on another level. My parents are civil servants and would not be able to cater for my tertiary education. In 5 years I will be able to pursue my studies without any hindrances. I'll also get the opportunity to study perfectly under conducive environment where resources would be readily available. Getting the Edoofa program would also connect me with the world at large since I would meet with other students from all over the world. I will also acquire necessary skills and knowledge that I will apply in my working experience after leaving Edoofa. Surely Edoofa will change my life for the better and I'll be able to look after my parents and siblings. In short this program will uplift me in particular, my family and society in general
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
19/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 496 0893: Yes sir
19/12/23, 5:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 496 0893: Yes sir i will do my best to get good grades
