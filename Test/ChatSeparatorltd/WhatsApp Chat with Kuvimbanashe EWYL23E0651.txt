19/12/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 228 2821: This is Martha Nhende.... Am Kuvimbanashe's mom. Am happy to join you in the session.
19/12/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello🌟 Welcome to the session, and it's a pleasure to have you join us!
I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey 🚀
19/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you.
19/12/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263778010698 I am waiting for your response on this.
19/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 801 0698: My long term goal is to be a successful young person that will provide influence to both the external and internal parties that reciprocates the livelihoods of many people regardless of their race and skin colour. Furthermore I want to invest in real estate and the stock market 
I am truly humbled and grateful for the opportunity to say the most since I think the Earn while you learn program will help me boost my dreams and goals to be a non financial and financial motivator within the community I live in and to address the basic economic problem that is scarcity with the knowledge that I would have acquired throughout the whole processes and sessions
19/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 801 0698: EWYL will also make my dream come true as it lessens the financial burden in this journey.
19/12/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals! Your aspirations to be a positive influence and contribute to the well-being of others, along with your interest in real estate and the stock market, showcase a commendable vision. I'm delighted that you see the Earn While You Learn program as a valuable tool to help you achieve these dreams. It's fantastic that you recognize the program's potential to ease financial burdens and provide you with the knowledge needed for your journey. I look forward to supporting you on this exciting path and helping you make strides toward your goals! 🚀
19/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 801 0698: Thank you very much
I appreciate
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 801 0698: No I am not familiar with them
19/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 801 0698: You may need to enlighten them to me.... But I think one of these is to assist students near and far to get education and fulfill their dreams
19/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 801 0698: Noted 
Thank you for adding to my understanding
19/12/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 801 0698: Okay it's nice to know them 
Thank you for the introductions Ms. Aditi
19/12/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 801 0698: Yeah it really sounds interesting
Thank you very much for sharing the information
19/12/23, 9:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
19/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 801 0698: Sure!. It was exiting
Have a nice day
19/12/23, 9:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
19/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 801 0698: Sure!
19/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 228 2821: Thank you.
20/12/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 801 0698: Good morning
20/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning☀️
Wishing you a day filled with positivity, productivity, and moments that bring a smile to your face. 

So let's begin our today's session🚀
20/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 801 0698: Thank you 
I also wish you the very same
20/12/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
20/12/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
20/12/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 801 0698: Okay
20/12/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
20/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 801 0698: Okay from the first newsletter I really liked the part that Mr. Angad read in the intercept of a conversation with Shane Perrish

That they were able to take advantage of the situations that came across them in the year 2008 and the COVID 19 phase 
Since they were able to invest more in those years
20/12/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!
20/12/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound ?
20/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 801 0698: I agree with you that is amazing and great
20/12/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
20/12/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
20/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 801 0698: 1. Ms. Aditi is my EWYL mentor
Ms. Sanjana is the head of the department
And Ms. Davi is the head coach

2. -Making sure that my academic journey is great
-Ensuring that I am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India

4. The hall of inspiration is an amazing platform where fellow edoofians share their experiences after being found playing an amazing role within the communities they interact with
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
20/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 801 0698: Yes indeed everything is clearly noted
