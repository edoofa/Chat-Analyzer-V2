21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Sandra, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to know Tendai better as a student!

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies along with what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education.
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Tendai is a quiet hard working girl who has dreams of doing medicine. She wants to be a Eurology surgeon to be specific.
21/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Her passion for being a Doctor has always been there since her childhood but the specialisation to the Euro route was brought about by mum's sickness as she suffered from cancer for close to 10years which she finally succumbed to so she would always say if only i had finished school
21/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently at Daramombe doing her A levels
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 340 7203: For Ordinary level she was at St Mary's Magdalene were she attained 9 passes
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently doing Maths, Chemistry and Biology
21/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She likes music and travelling
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you for the considerations...the help will indeed go a long way.
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I would like to express my grief to hear the same please.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Surely the students have to aim higher and give their best short and not focus on the minimum qualifying criteria.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I can see how that must have affected you all and her which eventually drove her to pursue a career in medical sector.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please.
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
21/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Good morning.
I am well thank you.
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Yes we can start
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Yes please, thank you
22/11/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: You happened to mention her subjects, 

However I can see she didn't pursue Physics in her A level, may I know the reason behind the same please?
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: Two factors were at play, When we explained to the school on what she wanted to do ultimately (medicine) they advised us on a combination to take which was Maths, Chemistry and Physics 2) She did not have the result that she expectedics, she had a C at O level which is normally a range of between 51 to 59% pass so she felt she did not do so well as compared to Chemistry and was afraid that it may be more difficult for her to pass the Physics at A. level.
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: sorry Maths, Chemistry and Biology there on the advise from the school.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please, I do understand.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 340 7203: Ooh owkay, so it means one has to do all the three at Alevel and 2 or less.
Like in this case she is doing Chemistry and Biology only of the mandatory subjects.
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 340 7203: How would we go about it in her case, is there room to use O level Physics passes.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: All three are a mandatory requirement.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 340 7203: Oooh owkay, very well noted.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 340 7203: Well received, we will have to share the information with Tendai and discuss on how we can go about it at this stage.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Thats completely alright please!
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
22/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 340 7203: thank you so much for your time, you were quiet helpful. I will get in touch if we happen to have any questions after discussing with Tendai

22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Will get in touch with the school and see if its possible...thank you.

18/12/23, 8:15 am - Harmehak: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*

18/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Alright then Tendai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 131 9112: I see myself getting better at my  clinical skills as a therapist and Edoofa  will help me acquire knowledge, work harder to sharpen my skills
18/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tendai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 131 9112: There is better quality education  that improve my skills  that l am more concerned about rather than in my own country were l am not exposed  , meeting different people with their cultures and learning them  
and to learn from my peers
18/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You see, Tendai, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
18/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Oooh thank you

thank you l appreciate
18/12/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Not really, we are still doing research
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 131 9112: The  scholarship really makes it affordable 

Does the university offer payment plans for the tuition fees
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tendai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Woooow , that will be greater especially on 90 to 100% scholarship, surely  Edoofa has  its students at heart
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Tendai, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 131 9112: I really do agree
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Yes l am
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 131 9112: It is indeed an opportunity to make money for the reduction of higher education fees
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/12/23, 7:07 am - +263 71 131 9112: 😊Oooh it surely reduces the burden, also ensures that the student receives a realistic picture of the happenings
19/12/23, 7:08 am - +263 71 131 9112: Good morning Ms Harmehak
19/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 131 9112: Yes please
19/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Tendai.
19/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 131 9112: You are indeed different 
So  the EWYL program ends the  moment  you finish your course ?
19/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Yes please, as its related to your course itself.

You see you begin with your Earn While You Learn Program while you are still in Zimbabwe itself.
19/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: So Tendai, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 131 9112: Oooh  that's good news
19/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 131 9112: Yes l am
19/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Indeed please.
19/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Tendai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 131 9112: $1500 to $2250
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 131 9112: That is indeed affordable
19/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
19/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: You see Tendai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 131 9112: I do think so
19/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 131 9112: Okay what if l pass but my results are not good enough for the chosen course , am l not allowed to choose another course that matches with the results
19/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Yes please, you are allowed to change your course as well even after enrolling into the program, Tendai.

Since we do understand that changes can be required from the student's end, due to the same itself, the Academic Board has allowed to change program if/when required.
19/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 131 9112: Okay thats clear ma'am
19/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
19/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
19/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 131 9112: I do understand ma'am
19/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
19/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

19/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “20-12-23” at 10:30 AM. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable.

Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
