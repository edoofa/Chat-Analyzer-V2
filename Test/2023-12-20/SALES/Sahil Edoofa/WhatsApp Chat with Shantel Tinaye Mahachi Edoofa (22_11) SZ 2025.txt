So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
02/12/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 741 8328: I would definitely say that studying in India would be a fantastic opportunity for my career and personal development. On my own perspective it is going to make me achieve my goals due to :
1. The strong emphasis on research and innovation would allow me to develop skills that are in high demand in the global job market. 

2. Studying in India would also give me access to a vast network of experts and professionals in my field, which would be beneficial for my career development.

3. Additionally, the diverse cultural environment and international student community would allow me to develop intercultural and interpersonal skills, which are essential for working in a global
02/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
02/12/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 741 8328: I'm not really familiar with that but i think the costs associated with studying in a University abroad,  especially for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship, It can be quite expensive. So yes, the cost of higher education can be a barrier for many people.
02/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Shantel! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
02/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
02/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
02/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes !!  My family is able to afford the cost of education
02/12/23, 8:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shantel. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
02/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I would like to know more about THE EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shantel. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
02/12/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
02/12/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 741 8328: I think it would be an extremely beneficial program for me! I can imagine that having the chance to work with companies and network with industry professionals would be incredibly valuable in helping me develop my skills and prepare for a successful career. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me!
02/12/23, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
02/12/23, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
02/12/23, 9:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
02/12/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

*"Embrace the challenges in your journey, for they are the stepping stones to your success." - Unknown*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/12/23, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
04/12/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Good evening Mr Shashwat, Sorry for late reply there was a problem bt now its fixed
04/12/23, 9:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Shantel!
04/12/23, 9:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
04/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I did understand the information
04/12/23, 9:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
04/12/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes, I can clearly see the benefit of the EWYL program now. It's a really great initiative by Edoofa to help students earn scholarship credits while they are learning. This will not only reduce the financial burden on parents
04/12/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
04/12/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/12/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/12/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Out of the four points, I appreciate the Earn While You Learn, program most because it helps the students in earning credits to reduce their cost of education and also helps them to learn and gain practical experience at the same time. I believe that practical training is necessary to prepare students for the real world and also increase their employability skills. It's a truly unique and practical approach that can make a big difference in the lives of students and parents as well
04/12/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Shantel! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
04/12/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/12/23, 10:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 741 8328: We can start
05/12/23, 9:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Shantel!
05/12/23, 9:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
05/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 741 8328: Well, my family is thrilled about me studying abroad! They understand that it will be a valuable experience for me, as it will provide me with the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience that is not easily accessible in my home country. They are also proud of my initiative and resilience in pursuing my goals. Even though they will miss me, they are supportive of my decision to pursue higher education abroad. Overall, I feel very grateful for their support and encouragement. I know that they will be cheering me on every step of the way! 😊
05/12/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
05/12/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
05/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 741 8328: That will be a good chance to know the experiences of other students with Edoofa
05/12/23, 11:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 741 8328: There are also requirements like 

Standardized Tests - Most universities require students to take standardized to get admitted to a graduate program. These tests are designed to measure your verbal, mathematical, and analytical skills and are often a significant factor in the admissions process.

Transcripts - These are official records of your academic achievements and are an essential part of the application process. Universities use
05/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
05/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 7:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
05/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 741 8328: I think what you have just shared is a very compelling and convincing argument for students to enroll in the Edoofa Program. The cost savings and comprehensive support provided through the program make it a no-brainer for students looking to study abroad.
05/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

06/12/23, 8:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Believe in the magic within you, for that's where dreams come to life." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Oky does Edoofa also give Visa to students or you will do it on your own
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes we can start
06/12/23, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Shantel!
06/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, please.

06/12/23, 1:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
06/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Edoofa helps students in two major ways. Firstly, by reducing the financial burden of the application and admission process. Secondly, by providing flexible payment options to make the process even more affordable. Additionally, through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa helps students gain financial independence and earn money to fund their higher education. All in all, the Edoofa Program is a complete solution for students looking to study abroad without any financial stress or burden.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Shantel Tinaye Mahachi Edoofa (22/11) SZ" to "Shantel Tinaye Mahachi Edoofa (22/11) SZ 2025"

06/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Right now its the Personalised Counseling Session
06/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
06/12/23, 10:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
06/12/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes you can explain them
06/12/23, 10:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
06/12/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Oky i understand
06/12/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

*"The greatest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." - Oprah Winfrey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 741 8328: Yes  !! Ready
09/12/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
09/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 741 8328: Yes my mother is ready but we cannot get hold of my father he is offline Since Wednesday and he is at work
09/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can they please acknowledge the same using voice notes?
09/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 187 7048: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023 for $200 and the 18th or 19th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/12/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session on Monday at 09:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day.

Stay Blessed!

11/12/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 741 8328: He said that he is ready to pay if I'm found eligible
On his behalf its fine we can move forward

11/12/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 741 8328: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/12/23, 8:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/12/23, 8:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023 for $200 and the 18th or 19th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 09:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session

16/12/23, 9:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you *Mr. Lamson Mahachi , Mrs. Caroline Mugiriki and Shantel Tinaye Mahachi’s*,

*I am Sahil, the Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* 

I have been actively involved in evaluating your application since the beginning of your sessions with our dedicated counselor. I must express my admiration for your commitment to supporting your child's higher education, a sentiment echoed not only in your application but also in the positive feedback received from your school authorities.

Having closely followed your journey, I am pleased to inform you that your interview was impressive, and I personally advocated for your selection during discussions with the Academic Board. Your dedication and enthusiasm have played a significant role in securing your eligibility for the scholarship.
16/12/23, 9:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Lamson Mahachi and Mrs. Caroline Mugiriki as Shantel Tinaye Mahachi’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
16/12/23, 9:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 11:22 pm - +263 77 274 5503: Thank you very much I am happy may God bless you alll
16/12/23, 11:23 pm - +263 77 274 5503: Notes
18/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 274 5503: Very Good morning, we are deposit usd 200 for Tinaye today and I will send the payment confirmation
18/12/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
18/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 274 5503: I am doing very fine sir.
18/12/23, 11:54 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
18/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 274 5503: Yes please but I am depositing in Charles account I am.in the bank right now
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
