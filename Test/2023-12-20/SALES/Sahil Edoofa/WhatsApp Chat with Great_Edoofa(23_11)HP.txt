28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Oww so the minimum number of points is 2 owk Maam

Yeah I am confident fully
28/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yah we aim for higher points and we are expecting good results
28/11/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: That's good, Great
28/11/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study BBA ?
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 081 5279: <Media omitted>

28/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Well noted...👍🏻
29/11/23, 7:49 am - Harmehak: Good morning Great!

How are you doing today?
29/11/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 081 5279: Absolutely fine Maa.
29/11/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 081 5279: Absolutely fine Maam
29/11/23, 8:13 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/11/23, 8:19 am - +263 78 081 5279: No Maam we are not familiar with that
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Harmehak: Alright please
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 8:27 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:04 pm - +27 83 434 2213: Noted
29/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Noted Maam
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
29/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yes Maam
30/11/23, 7:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning Great,

How are you doing today?
30/11/23, 7:39 am - +263 78 081 5279: Good morning Maam 

...I'm absolutely fine this morning

01/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam we came to discuss that studying abroad is a life changing decision. We also discussed that India makes it affordable for students who are in other countries 

Also we did talk about employment that is offered at Edoofa after completing your higher education
Also we discussed that Edoofa offers real time live online projects where by one can gain experience while getting opportunity to earn schoolarship credits then lastly we discussed about the EWYL program
01/12/23, 3:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
01/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yes Maam we managed to talk to Mrs Ruth we discussed and she did mention about the Edoofa university that it is a program that gives you 50 percent scholarship and above
Also she mentioned that it gives you enough time to prepare for your higher education
01/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Mrs Ruth also mentioned the EWYL program that it helps reduce fees and costs

She also said that if it wasn't for Edoofa she wouldn't have made it for her children to study abroad

Lastly she said that the fees that you pay is a smaller percent after you get a schoolarship
01/12/23, 6:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
01/12/23, 6:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023!

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 081 5279: 1. The name of the course is B.com
02/12/23, 1:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for other answers

02/12/23, 2:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
02/12/23, 2:42 pm - +27 83 434 2213: Yes we are ready
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 7 th  or 8 th December 2023 for $200 and the  7 th  or 8 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 7th  or 8th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/12/23, 3:34 pm - +27 83 434 2213: Yes we are ready
02/12/23, 3:50 pm - +27 83 434 2213: I would go for option 1

Shall I get you the slots for Monday?
02/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yes

06/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yes actually I have some few questions that I need clarification on
07/12/23, 11:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
07/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 081 5279: All good thanks
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you share your questions with me ?
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 081 5279: Everything is going well by my side thank you
08/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 081 5279: Sorry Ma'am for delaying I've been very busy lately but I'm here now
08/12/23, 12:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
08/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 081 5279: Yes I want to know more about the payment mode
08/12/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/12/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
