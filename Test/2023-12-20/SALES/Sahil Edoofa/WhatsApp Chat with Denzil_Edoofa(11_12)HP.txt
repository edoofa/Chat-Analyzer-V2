12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 510 9943: It is interesting indeed...
I'm taken by provision of employability driven strategies in order to become future leaders
12/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 510 9943: And Edoofa is well known and recognized internationally
12/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Yes please Denzil
12/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 510 9943: Very true
 I'm impressed
So how is the education life with edoofa... I'm interested in  knowing  more about the edoofa schoolarship
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: We will discuss everything in detail.
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Denzil, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 510 9943: Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the edoofa team for responding to my application.I'm Lungelo Denzil Machekano aged 18. I did both my O and A level at Matopo High school and I'm currently waiting for my A level results.Dedication to school work is my first principle.However, i have learnt that dedication to school work goes with striving for a complete character and discipline so that learning becomes prosperous.All these values made me get flourishing results during my Ordinary level. I'm astonished to have got 5As 4Bs and 2Cs in a science class.
I'm interested in the field of medicine or Pathology. 
One of my strengths is working hard and punctuality to be a great leader in the future. I'm not much of  a sport person but one of my hobbies would be playing darts. 
I live with my mother who holds a degree in Records and Archives  and  is currently an Archivist  at ministry of health and Child care.I don't have any siblings.
12/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Denzil, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Thank you
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Well Denzil, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes! higher education abroad is a life changing decision. However, higher education can be skill development, practical learning or a conductive environment and I'm sure edoofa covers all these aspects refering to the articles i have read and the  video I have watched.
12/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Denzil 

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I'm very ready and i hope the place is environmentally friendly to accept me.
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Ofcourse it is, Denzil.

Our students are our first priority and you would definitely learn more.
12/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Denzil, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes they are aware snd they are willing to support me
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 510 9943: and*
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 848 0330: I am supporting him
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please

It's great to have you acknowledge yourself.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Noted please.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I'm confident that i will maximize and aim higher
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 510 9943: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 510 9943: My A level combination was
Pure Mathematics
Chemistry
Biology
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Medicine, Denzil?
12/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 510 9943: The ability to help other people and save lives is the one that motivates me the most and be recognized as the best doctor. However, I'm the first in my family to be in a science and that motivates me to make a pace and inspire the next generation of my family to become doctors that would make a difference.
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 510 9943: To be in a science class*
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a kind heart that wishes to do well, Denzil.

So did you also happen to research about the requirements of your desired field?
12/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I only know that you should get straight As to get into the field.. But i would love to know more from you.
12/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
12/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay so if i have Mathematics
Biology
Chemistry
I won't be able to pursue medicine
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory requirement please
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 510 9943: How about medical laboratory technology
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: You can surely pursue the same, 

So what intrigued you towards Medical Laboratory Technology, Denzil?
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I want to do something that will land me in a  hospital and i saw medical laboratory science as a solution because it will make me work with doctors so that i provide correct test results and diagnosis
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: That's well thought off, Denzil.
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Following would be description about Medical Laboratory Technology!
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is an undergraduate Medical Lab Technology program which is a 3 years course. Medical Laboratory Technology program also called Clinical laboratory science is an allied health profession that is concerned with the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease through the use of clinical laboratory tests. During the program these tests help candidates to learn and diagnose, detect and treat diseases. Additionally the program deals with the collecting of information's sampling, reporting, testing and documentation.


Such graduates are hired in capacities such as Laboratory Technician, Laboratory Manager, Medical Officer, Research Associate, Medical Record Technician, Resident Medical Officer, Lab Assistant, Laboratory Testing Manager, Associate Professor/Lecturer etc.

Medical technicians can get job opportunities in places such as hospitals, health care clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists’ offices, etc.
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *A Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Technology student could work in the field of forensic medicine as a forensic laboratory technician, performing tasks such as analyzing samples and testing specimens to assist in criminal investigations and trials. However, they may need to obtain additional training and certification specific to forensic science. Additionally, the specific job responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the laboratory and jurisdiction.*
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

A Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology prepares individuals to work in medical laboratories, where they perform a variety of tests to analyze biological samples and support the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Graduates with this degree can pursue careers in the healthcare and medical field, including:

Medical Laboratory Technologist

In these roles, individuals with a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology may be involved in performing laboratory tests to detect the presence of diseases, analyzing and interpreting test results, and working with healthcare professionals to develop and implement effective treatments. These professionals play a critical role in supporting the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, and their work is essential to the effective functioning of healthcare organizations.
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 510 9943: It is an interesting career indeed
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 510 9943: So since its a 3 year course is there an  attachment training during the course of learning?
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes can surely request for an attachment,

While you would anyway be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay that's great
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes I'm interested
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Denzil, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 510 9943: If i get the opportunity to study this career i see my self as an qualified Medical laboratory scientist with a first class degree working in a hospital helping hand in hand with others inorder to save lives. Edoofa would help me study this career and find me the best university to study this career and it will solve my financial problems
12/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Denzil, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Zimbabwe has high levels of inflation so the fees are high and i believe that if edoofa schoolarship accepts me it would help me solve my problem. Studying abroad will help me interact with other student and professors in the department to pursue a prosperous career
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Denzil.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Studying in India would help me very much because of the affordable compared to many of the world's finest institutions, India's low cost of education is a bargain according to my research scholarships are  available to offset the cost. It is said India's economy continues to surge. India is also known for comprehensive tax system, business friendly laws, low operational costs.Not to forget that the CEOs of companies like Google, pepsi, Microsoft etc are all Indians that makes the education in Indian ranked high and this proves that there is quality education in India
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Denzil.

I am glad you have awareness and knowledge about the country.
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

12/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 510 9943: That's great
12/12/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following, Denzil.

Did you go through the entire resources?
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes I'm fascinated by what the pictures tell me
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Denzil.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 510 9943: No i didn't get that during my research
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay that is good
12/12/23, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Denzil, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay so i have to pass my A level remarkably to get a fully funded schoolarship
12/12/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Can you please share your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 510 9943: A fully funded schoolarship is the one given to students who excelled in their results with higher grades hence a fully funded schoolarship would cover all the tuition fees, the visa and other expenses
12/12/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay thank you for making me understand
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same too?
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 510 9943: No i don't have
12/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Now did you understand regarding the 90-100% scholarship?
12/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Not really please explain further
12/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay I understand now
12/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Denzil, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I agree
12/12/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Denzil?
12/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
12/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay thank you
13/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 510 9943: Good morning
13/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
13/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
13/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

13/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 510 9943: Okay i understand
13/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the same, Denzil?
13/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 510 9943: I'm still reading
13/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: That's great,

You can inform me once done.
13/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 510 9943: Done.
13/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: That's good
13/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 510 9943: That's great
13/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Sure please, Denzil
13/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 510 9943: Done
13/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: That is great, Denzil,

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
13/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
13/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Denzil, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
13/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 510 9943: Alot of money
13/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Can you please address the same?
13/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 510 9943: I don't understand
13/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

Can you please share the exact amount?
13/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
13/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: How much is $300x5 and $450x5?
13/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 510 9943: $1500 and $2250 respectively
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 510 9943: Okay i understand
13/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same too, Denzil?
13/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 510 9943: Yes i did
13/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
13/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 510 9943: Okay so where do we pay
13/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: You pay after being accepted into the program and receiving the acceptance letter.

The details of banking modes will be shared in the acceptance letter itself.
13/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
13/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
13/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
13/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 510 9943: So currently I'm in stage 1?
13/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
13/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
13/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
13/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
13/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay
13/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
13/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Edoofa is great hey!
13/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Denzil.

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, you can directly call her too.
13/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
13/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
13/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. Tomorrow, on *14-12-23* at 10:30 P.M. CAT, *Mr. Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*, will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as Mr. Sahil's time is valuable.
