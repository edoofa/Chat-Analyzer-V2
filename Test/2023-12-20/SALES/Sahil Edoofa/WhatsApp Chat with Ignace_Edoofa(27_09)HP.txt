17/10/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please this a scholarship not a Sponsorship
17/10/23, 6:46 pm - +250 782 323 272: Yes but I don't have a sponsor
17/10/23, 7:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwe Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time
17/10/23, 9:45 pm - +250 782 323 272: Yeah the problem is still that money my parents have to pay.
17/10/23, 10:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you read this ?
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - +250 782 323 272: Yes I red it but I'm still answering your question about if my parent is able to pay my financial. Then about this explainations you gave me I'm agree with it and I want to get sponsorship according to job. Thanks
17/10/23, 10:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa is not a Sponsorship
17/10/23, 10:54 pm - +250 782 323 272: Yeah you told me everything about it I know. But you can help me to find that sponsorship
17/10/23, 10:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Go through this again and apply back once you really are ready financially to move ahead .
18/10/23, 5:50 pm - +250 782 323 272: Okay let me look on it again
19/12/23, 10:16 pm - +250 782 323 272: Hello
