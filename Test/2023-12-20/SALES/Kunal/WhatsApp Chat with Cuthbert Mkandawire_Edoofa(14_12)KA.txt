Will try next time 

Thanks
14/12/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: Mr Opani, the 2025 intake is already open which is the reason the students who are writing exams next year also got the chance to apply now. By the time they wait for their results to be out the scholarship seats would have already been full as we receive applicants from 29+ countries and the results in Western African Countries would be out even before Malawi.
