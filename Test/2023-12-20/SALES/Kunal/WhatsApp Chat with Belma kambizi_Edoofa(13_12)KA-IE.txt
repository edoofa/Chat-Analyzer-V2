Medicine and technology  power,for instance  mathematics  and sciences are studied  there  .hence this is also beneficial  to Africans to become bests scientists in their countrie as indians.

15/12/23, 1:59 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 973 7102: Yes  am confident
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
16/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 973 7102: From my research ....india ha emerged as a destination with cutting  edge education, cultural ethos , english as the primary medium of instruction  and students who are mentally  , academically and emotionally  prepared to  take on the world. 

The education system  in india is affordable than in other countries. 
As compared to other countries there is higher education in india because of the  dominance  of English  for instance many countries do not use english language but it is a global  language .hence it can be noted that its beneficial for one to educate it in india.
The indian education system is also beneficial  to Africans  when they study there they may educate diverse traditions  , cultures , rituals which are practised there.therefore whey they came back to their origin  countries  they would bring more knowlege  , skills which enhance the development  and growth of the country.


On my research  i have found  that     mathematics and science which are recommended by Africans to be studied  are also studied in india.hence thats why  many people of the indian origin on top and indian scientists  making path  breaking technological  research  and  advances.therefore i have admired this opportunity  for Africans to study and observe the rigorious curriculum in india that gives rise to such brainy and enterprising  students of medicine and technology.

In coclusion i can say that the  affordability  , quality education system of India  determines a successful life , archievement of goals when one study  there.

18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
18/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 973 7102: My mother  and my father will  be helping me financially
18/12/23, 1:38 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 973 7102: They are very delighted,wishing as well as wiliing me to study abroad
18/12/23, 1:48 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
18/12/23, 1:48 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 973 7102: These are other  requirements but i think  one can also write about his/ her  address,your ordinary and advanced  level qualifications  are also required, writing about any field you have partake in it ,...


THAT  is what  i think
18/12/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
18/12/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/12/23, 1:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 973 7102: Okay
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 973 7102: Okay
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 973 7102: We have discussed stage 2
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 973 7102: Yes you  can explain
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
18/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 973 7102: Okay thank ...now in picture with the process
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

18/12/23, 5:16 pm - Kunal: It was a pleasure to host the session with you today!

I am contented with your responses and performance so far as a result, let me promote your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.
Your next session is scheduled at *12:00 pm CAT Tomorrow (19/12/2023)*, and I will evaluate your application and guide you through the most important *Eligibility Check* after addressing your questions.

Make sure to be available on time after having a detailed discussion with your family and *it is strongly recommended for parents/guardians of the applicant to be online for the next session as higher education is a family decision.*


Happy Family Discussion
Stay Blessed!
