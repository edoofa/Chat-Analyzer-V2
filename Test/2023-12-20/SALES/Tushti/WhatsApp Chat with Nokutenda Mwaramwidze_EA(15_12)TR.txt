19/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 562 8299: Yes I understand completely
19/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 562 8299: Please may I ask..... Can you become a Chatered Financial Analyst after undertaking B. Com
19/12/23, 1:02 pm - Tushti: Yes definitely
19/12/23, 1:03 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 562 8299: 5 years after completion I see myself working in my dream occupation.... Probably working as a freelance CFA which means i will be traveling hopefully which has always been a dream of mine. I'll be an aspiring entrepreneur and using all the skills I would have earned in the course of the degree to better my life. I'll hopefully be working in my dream country by then which is Singapore. But this all rides upon getting into the Edoofa Program. Being part and parcel of the Edoofa program will help me to complete my higher education abroad which is the backbone of all my dreams.
19/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

19/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 562 8299: Yes 300% if needed
19/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 562 8299: I'm really all in and willing to pull up my sleeves and get to work
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Tushti: I am glad to hear that, however, do tell me why you wish to study abroad and not in your own country?
19/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 562 8299: I that there are better chances for me out there..... Chances of employment especially with the occupation that I want... And I feel like I need the exposure that may not be provided by my country
19/12/23, 2:55 pm - Tushti: I see
19/12/23, 2:55 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
19/12/23, 3:52 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
