16/12/23, 11:08 am - +260 777004720: Understood
16/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
16/12/23, 11:12 am - +260 777004720: No we don’t
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: In simple words Bright, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/12/23, 11:21 am - +260 777004720: Understood
16/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: I would like for the parent to come onlien and share their understand as well
16/12/23, 11:22 am - +260 777004720: Sure let me tell him
16/12/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: I am still waiting, dear
16/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 97 7865571: This is the parent, can you kindly take me through the fees
16/12/23, 11:46 am - Tushti: Everything has been explained above, please
16/12/23, 11:47 am - Tushti: Kindly go through the chat and let me know if you have any questions
16/12/23, 11:54 am - +260 97 7865571: I have gone through everything and I have understood everything
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: Very well, now let me explain the EWYL Program to you in detail
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/12/23, 12:26 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
16/12/23, 12:33 pm - +260 777004720: It is
16/12/23, 12:33 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes
16/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Bright, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/12/23, 12:35 pm - +260 777004720: It would be alot
16/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Kindly calculate the answer
16/12/23, 12:54 pm - +260 777004720: It would cost about $1500-$2250 to apply in 5 universities
16/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Exactly Bright, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/12/23, 1:15 pm - +260 777004720: Yes, because by doing so it is helping reduce cost of payments to one and payable fee
16/12/23, 1:17 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
16/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 777004720: Understood
16/12/23, 2:35 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
16/12/23, 2:35 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 777004720: Ok
16/12/23, 2:35 pm - Tushti: Alright Bright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/12/23, 2:36 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/12/23, 2:36 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/12/23, 2:36 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/12/23, 2:36 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
16/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 777004720: No
16/12/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/12/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Monday at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
16/12/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

18/12/23, 11:02 am - +260 777004720: For the course
18/12/23, 11:05 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
18/12/23, 11:08 am - +260 777004720: Understood
18/12/23, 11:08 am - Tushti: May I know why its taking so long for your parent to answer?

18/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: This is important as well
18/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: I am still expecting a response @260977865571
18/12/23, 8:55 pm - +260 97 7865571: He wants to pursue a course involving computer, so as you advised him BACHELOR OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS is the course is going to undergo
18/12/23, 8:57 pm - +260 97 7865571: The country  he will be doing the course from  is India
18/12/23, 8:58 pm - +260 97 7865571: $6000-$8000 is the cost of studies in India minus any scholarships
18/12/23, 9:11 pm - +260 97 7865571: At this time the economy in my country is not at its best so I would lie to mention any sum of money but all I want is for him to get quality education

19/12/23, 10:30 am - Tushti: It has been clearly explained here, please
19/12/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 7865571: Ok
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Now, can you answer the question?
19/12/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 7865571: OK a bit
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: Sure, please answer

 Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case Bright is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then Bright's entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
19/12/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *26th December 2023* for $200 and the  *26th January* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *26th December 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
19/12/23, 10:59 am - +260 97 7865571: Madam why can't you push this payment after festival days
19/12/23, 11:13 am - Tushti: Can you help me understand why it would be difficult to pay before the festival days?
19/12/23, 11:42 am - +260 97 7865571: Ok
19/12/23, 11:48 am - Tushti: @260977865571 Will you be able to make the payment before 24th December?
19/12/23, 11:49 am - +260 97 7865571: I will get back to you
19/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: Please do share any concerns or challneges you may have, I am here to help you plan your child's future
19/12/23, 11:53 am - +260 97 7865571: Thanks my helper
19/12/23, 12:04 pm - +260 97 7865571: Let me be honest with you I want really my child to study in India
19/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 97 7865571: But as for now things are not all that good dollar has made us Zambian not to do well
19/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: However, you already mentioned that the family was financially prepared for this scholarship
19/12/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 7865571: It is but days are very few you gave
19/12/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 7865571: 3 contacts.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: How would you like for me to help you out here?
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - +260 97 7865571: I thought of January that's when I will have money
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - +260 97 7865571: By 10th january
19/12/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: As your child's Counsellor at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your child's education and guide you through the details of our scholarship program. We understand that ensuring your child receives a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for Bright's  brighter future.
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - Tushti: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Zambia, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security. Isn't it?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - Tushti: As you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they might be willing to consider your situation and provide, you with a part fee payment plan of $100. Which will have to be completed within the next 7 days to secure your child's seat. You can then pay 2nd $100 to complete the enrollment formalities by the 10th Of Janauary.

That's the maximum I can do for you after looking at your situation right, I hope this will be helpful?
