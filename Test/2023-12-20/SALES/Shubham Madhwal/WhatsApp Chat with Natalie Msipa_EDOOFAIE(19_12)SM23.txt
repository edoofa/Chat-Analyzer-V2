19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I am a lively, confident and caring young woman. I am an avid reader of novels, a singer, artist and a good essay writer. I come from a family of six and I am the eldest. My family especially my mother, has been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me. I have been fascinated with studying in a field of science for as long as I can remember. I want to take up a career that would allow me to apply  the knowledge from school to make useful products in a clean, green and effecient way, to solve practical problems especially those that are health related and improve my communication skills. I aspire to pursue a program in the health sector  particularly, pharmacy.
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: 1. Partial funded
2.$7000 to $ 8000
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: 3.$2000 to $3000
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Theoretical knowledge is limited because one doesn't get to apply any skill practically causing confusion and a lack of understanding of knowledge.
Practical knowledge allows one to know whether or not they have understood what they have learnt and especially how to apply that knowledge.
The problems people face requires us to have practical knowledge not just theoretical knowledge
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I aspire to pursue a career in the health sector, particularly pharmacy. I am from Zimbabwe and main challenges students are facing is the issue of lack of jobs that one would have studied for at a university. Most people who are employed for a particular job that they did not train for that particular job in the first place. So pursuing a degree is risky because you might not get employment for what you would have studied. Learning abroad is an advantage because you can get a job for a program that you pursue. The quality of education is better in terms of advancement in technology and enrichment of knowledge. There are more job opportunities and a decent salary that accompanies it. For pharmacy studying abroad especially Studying in India is a greater advantage especially with enrichment of knowledge and practical skills

d. I am hard working and self driven. I want to pursue a  career in the medical field particularly in pharmacy, not for fame, but to create gender equity and to challenge myself and have confidence in my own ability especially in an industry that is male dominated. Furthering my education in chemistry will allow me to make a difference, produce produce an effective change for society's benefit and improve in my communication skills. The Edoofa scholarship will be the financial aid I need to do this. 

e. My parents are aware and will assist me with admission process
