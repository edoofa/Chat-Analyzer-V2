18/12/23, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 963 3305: Yes start
18/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 963 3305: My mother's phone is unable to install Whatsapp but she will be in touch with us later
18/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So do you  reside with your mother p lease?
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
19/12/23, 6:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
