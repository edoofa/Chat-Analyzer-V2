So are we good to begin your session?

18/12/23, 1:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

*Please let me know once you have added them*
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
19/12/23, 6:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
