11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mrs. Tsuro.
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As Oslie's evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate her interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
11/12/23, 7:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 453 2562: No I haven't
11/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 453 2562: I would like to hear from you.the opportunities,and the disadvantages if there are any
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
12/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Good afternoon to you
12/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Earlier I had asked of the opportunities available after finishing the courses

12/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 453 2562: When I checked on your list of courses which you offer I didn't see medicine on it do you offer it to foreign students or it does have a different name.
12/12/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Tsuro, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Oslie does not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*,

12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Maybe if you could provide me with the full list of the courses available in the medical field and requirements and maybe if you could shed more light in bsc in cardiovascular technology
12/12/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I have listed the requirements, Mrs. Tsuro
12/12/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *BSc Cardiovascular Technology* is a 3-year degree program that deals with diagnosing and monitoring diseases related to the heart and the circulatory system. 

In this program, students will get familiar with various complex procedures such as performing stent implants, setting up cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators in the treatment of heart diseases. 

The BSc Cardiovascular Technology syllabus includes subjects such as Human Anatomy, Cardiovascular System, Physiology, Pathology, Electrocardiography and Echocardiography.

BSc Cardiovascular Technology degree holders will be able to find work in various sectors such as Hospitals, Universities, Health organizations etc.

They may also serve as Cardiovascular Technician, Cardiovascular Technologist, Medical Sonographer, etc. Graduates have the opportunity to work in India or Abroad to pursue graduate studies and to get involved in research activities.

After completing this course, students can pursue higher studies and advanced academic exploration along with research through MSc and Certificate Courses. Students can also pursue MBA, PGDM courses. These courses essentially provides a solid basis for further studies and related prospects. 

*BSc Cardiovascular Technology: What is it about?*
Read the points given below to know what BSc Cardiovascular Technology course is all about: 

BSc in Cardiovascular Technology deals with various topics on the vascular or the circulatory system. 
Through this course, one gets to learn about the arteries, veins and the blood vessels that carry blood throughout the human body. These blood vessels are also instrumental in delivering oxygen and essential nutrients to the body tissues.

With the help of this course one gets to learn about the various cardiovascular diseases that affect the human body. 


This course also helps a cardiovascular technologist or technician to learn about the various procedures and tests while assisting the physician in diagnosing and treating a patient ailing from heart disease. 
Some of the complex procedures that a student learns in this course are implanting of stents and setting up a pacemaker. They learn through this course, both invasive  as well as non-invasive procedures in the treatment of heart diseases.

*Why Should You Study a BSc Cardiovascular Technology course?*

BSc Cardiovascular Technology is a prestigious and popular stream of study in the field of allied health sciences. This field of study has a lot of importance and applications as it concerns directly with the treatment of heart diseases. Let us see here some of the reasons why one should study B.Sc Cardiovascular Technology.

With more and more people suffering from heart diseases because of many factors including lifestyle, genetics and environment, the importance of this field of study is ever increasing.
Cardiologists and other heart surgeons greatly depend upon the services and support of cardiovascular technologists and technicians for carrying out various complex procedures on patients suffering from heart ailments.


With congenital heart diseases too on the rise, that is those that are prevalent in patients from birth itself, there is an increased awareness among different walks of people about the risks associated with such heart diseases. This in turn, further brings the field in limelight, as people are more likely to avail the services of a cardiovascular technologist.
The numerous advances in the medical field in this domain has been a boon for patients and the medical fraternity alike. With rapid advances in the field, the services are getting more and more affordable, with many availing such services.
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course might aligns with what you are aiming for Oslie*

12/12/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Tsuro, it's important to highlight that Oslie needs to have a background in physics, chemistry, and biology for dental therapy. Additionally, successfully clearing the NEET (National Entrance Eligibility Test), known as one of the toughest exams globally, with excellent marks is a prerequisite for eligibility in dental courses. Since Oslie is not having physics, I recognize your strong passion for working in the medical field, making a difference in people's lives through treatment. Your aspirations make you eligible to pursue some of the top courses in the medical field, as outlined above.
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 453 2562: And may you shed more light on physiotherapy and requirements
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Tsuro,
It is a pleasure connecting with you.
13/12/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is well noted!
13/12/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I hope that you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
13/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Same with me am glad sir
13/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You can address me as Ms. Pallika
13/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
13/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Ooooh sorry
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Mr. Tsuro
13/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 455 2095: To be with you l wasn't aware but now through the inquiries l have made thus far l now realize that
13/12/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Since we want the best for our child l would work round the clock to meet the requirements
13/12/23, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Enlighten me further
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think Oslie will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?* <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 455 2095: She is not the 1st to engage in such so obviously yes
13/12/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 455 2095: What kind of work will she be partaking,,,is it related to what she will be learning
13/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Or it's a different arena
13/12/23, 2:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
13/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Cool 😎 then
13/12/23, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Tsuro.
13/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Let's say we are lucky she gets selected who will then pay for airtickets
13/12/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not flight ticket because in the whole program the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't often travel, so considering these, the traveling fee
*is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
13/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Cool
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 455 2095: So this will come to fruition after A level results are out
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, I would like to know fruition of what are you referring to?
13/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Ok wanted to say will she will be considered after her A level results are out or way b4
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, Please note that enrollment for our 2025 intake is now open. Fortunately, Oslie still has the opportunity to join the program before her A-level results are out if she meets the eligibility criteria. Upon confirmation of eligibility, her admission process and participation in the EWYL program will be initiated before she arrives in India.
13/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Understood
13/12/23, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Tsuro, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
13/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 455 2095: 2
13/12/23, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

13/12/23, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
13/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Good to hear
13/12/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Tsuro, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 455 2095: It's every parent's wish to have his or child get the best education in a 1st world country
13/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Oslie's career advance at an even greater pace, as shewill be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting her family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents.
13/12/23, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
13/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Who provides for this,,,
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsuro, please note that we will be guiding you regarding the same.
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 455 2095: It's ok
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Understood
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
13/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
13/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
13/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Go ahead
13/12/23, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
13/12/23, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Good to hear
13/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 455 2095: 05
13/12/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Cool
13/12/23, 3:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
13/12/23, 3:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
13/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 455 2095: Absolutely
13/12/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Tsuro, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
13/12/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
