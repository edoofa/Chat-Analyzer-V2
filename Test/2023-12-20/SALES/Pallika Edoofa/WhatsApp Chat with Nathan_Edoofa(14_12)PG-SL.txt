14/12/23, 1:36 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: I should say not fully informed about the program
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please let me share some information with you.
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.


*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?*
14/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: This is well noted and thanks for sharing this information
14/12/23, 1:46 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: If I may ask how does it go? What are the steps to this successful journey?
14/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Bridget, I will be guiding you regarding the same in the further session.

14/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: now to help Nathan become a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with his introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about himself: his strengths, his weaknesses, his hobbies, and a detailed description of his family background. Also do share the following details:

1. His current educational MSCE and subject combination
2. The course he would like to study and why
3. What do his parents do (their profession)
4. What is his parent’s highest education level?
5. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?

7. Who will be financially supporting his higher education abroad
8. How much was his per-term fee in school in $?

10. What is the name of his MSCE school?
14/12/23, 2:08 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: Due to the high levels of internet scam, I will not be able to share his full details. Especially his personal details, my apologies for this. But his is doing his form 4, his father will financially support his tertiary education. He stays in Mchinji. He applied for business administration if not mistaken
14/12/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms Bridget, the concern is genuine and at the same time, these details are very important for us to evaluate your child's application and guide him forward. May I ask, are you concerned about the authenticity of the Edoofa program?
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: Sure, I may say so
14/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, as a concerned parent, what research have you done about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
Have you connected or met any of our Edoofians or their parents from Malawi in person to learn about their experiences through the program?
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: Yet to do this. But so far not any research I've made
14/12/23, 4:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Bridget, I understand, having concern is genuine, but don't you think it is necessary that you have to walk that extra mile to research the program, speak to our beneficiaries and gain enough knowledge to understand the reality of the program?
14/12/23, 8:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 8:29 pm - +265 998 33 05 77: Thanks for sharing. Will watch the video

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Nathan, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
