My name is Noxolo Mlotshwa  from Usher high school. I'm hear by representing the Edoofa scholarship programme. Firstly l would like to inform you l myself have managed to qualify for this programme.

11/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Good afternoon Noxolo.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

17/08/23, 1:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Good afternoon ma'am. Yes lm ready
17/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
17/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know why you are late Noxolo?
17/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 928 7493: It's network problems ma'am
17/08/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
17/08/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming from here:
When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
17/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 928 7493: understood ma'am
17/08/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Noxolo- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
17/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 928 7493: No questions ma'am we can move on
17/08/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: - It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
17/08/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
17/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Yes l am
17/08/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!

22/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 928 7493: I'm not sure how to explain SEO but influencer marketing means being influential or rather convincing to get customers or supporters
22/08/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I would like to correct you on this.
22/08/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Go through this explanation once.
*SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
22/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Okay noted
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
22/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Steps noted
22/08/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
22/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 928 7493: I'm going to create one ma'am
22/08/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great.
Till then you can send your picture.
22/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Okay working on it
22/08/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
22/08/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am waiting for your response.
22/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 928 7493: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You look great.
22/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Thank you
22/08/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please see your batch timings for your sessions. It will be on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY* from *9:30 AM to 11:00 AM*
22/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Alright noted
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 928 7493: During the session or anytime?
22/08/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Anytime but everyday.
22/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 928 7493: Okay
22/08/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/08/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
