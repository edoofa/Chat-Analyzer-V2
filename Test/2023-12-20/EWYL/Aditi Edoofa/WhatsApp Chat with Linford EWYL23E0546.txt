Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

23/08/23, 10:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is great.
23/08/23, 10:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Linford, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/08/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 041 2990: alright leh me share with you my long-term goals
23/08/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 041 2990: May I do this in a VN
23/08/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, you can do that.
23/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 041 2990: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 4:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am truly impressed by your long-term goals. 
Please excuse me for the late reply as I was caught up in a meeting.
23/08/23, 4:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
23/08/23, 4:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a wonderful day ahead!
23/08/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 041 2990: Alright thank you very much
24/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Student!
It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
24/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 041 2990: Good morning
24/08/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 041 2990: Well you can explain them to me
24/08/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/08/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 041 2990: alright they are now clear
24/08/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/08/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
24/08/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 041 2990: Alright leh me read
24/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 041 2990: Wow I've read
24/08/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, do let me know once done.
24/08/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
24/08/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 041 2990: alright thank you very much
25/08/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 041 2990: good morning to you  Ms Aditi
25/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
25/08/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 041 2990: I'm doing well and l hope the same for you
25/08/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am also well.
Thanks for asking.
25/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 041 2990: It's alright
25/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 041 2990: We can begin with our session
25/08/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
25/08/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
25/08/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
25/08/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 041 2990: Alright thank you
25/08/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yah indeed this is interesting
25/08/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>

25/08/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 041 2990: Wow i'm astonished,this is interesting and helpful
25/08/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 041 2990: You are right its difficult to point out because each section has got some great wise facts. But l will just point in particular the Newsletter 1 especially that inspiring journey of that student Jecheche. It motivated me greatly. I also liked the wise quotes which were enlisted.
25/08/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yeah it is a great deal
25/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Linford?
25/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 041 2990: It sounds great, especially knowing you have people around you who are actually concerned about your success and are willing to help in whatsoever way.Thank you
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that is why I am your mentor.
You're welcome!
25/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
25/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yes I am
25/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

1. Akello
2. Mindjoy

And the last one does not
08/09/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.

Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
12/09/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 041 2990: Ohhh alright I'm following up
12/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/09/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 041 2990: Okay please do that
12/09/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*LINFORD/ADITI/12SEPT23*
12/09/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/09/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
12/09/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
12/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 041 2990: Okay l understand very well

12/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 041 2990: okay
12/09/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/09/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/09/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All. <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
12/09/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
12/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 041 2990: alright this is the other information I have to share with them

​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.

14/09/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
14/09/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

15/09/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
15/09/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

15/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
15/09/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
15/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 041 2990: Ohh l love this,really

15/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 041 2990: Alright thus fine
15/09/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
15/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yah its clear
15/09/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
15/09/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
15/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 041 2990: Mmmmm no idea
15/09/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here let me help you
So your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 

After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._ <This message was edited>
15/09/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
15/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope it's clear.
15/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yes its clear
15/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

15/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 041 2990: Yes I will do so
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: And now this is it for your Initial orientation, now make sure that you message me on the EWYL Line and follow the "Proud Edoofian" ritual daily, and I hope you are excited for your first Saturday Activity that you will receive tomorrow.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
