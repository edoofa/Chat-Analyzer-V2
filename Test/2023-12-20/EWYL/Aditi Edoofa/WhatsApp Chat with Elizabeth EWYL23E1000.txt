18/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 430 7973: Thank you
18/12/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
18/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 430 7973: My goal in life is to complete the Legislative Law course and work at law firm, as a professional lawyer representing clients in both civil and criminal matters and have the most successful trials and criminal attorneys, like Abraham Lincoln , Fali Sam Nariman , etc..

The EWLY would provide me with the essential resources and information needed to achieve my career goals and establish myself within the legal profession. EWLY will help me attain both hard skills  for example (legal knowledge and experiences) and  it will help me with soft skills . With your mentorship, networking opportunities, I would have access to a wealth of valuable resources and information to help me achieve the legal job market and build professional connections.
18/12/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your ambitious goal of completing the Legislative Law course and working at a law firm as a professional lawyer is inspiring! The EWYL program can indeed be a valuable asset in providing you with the necessary resources and information to achieve your career aspirations. It offers a unique opportunity to acquire both hard skills, such as legal knowledge and experiences, and essential soft skills. Through mentorship and networking opportunities, the program will empower you to navigate the legal job market and establish meaningful professional connections. I'm here to support you on your journey toward becoming a successful lawyer.  Wishing you great success in your pursuit of legal excellence!🚀🌟
18/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 430 7973: Thank you
18/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 430 7973: Please explain.
18/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted
18/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
18/12/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 430 7973: Yeah!
18/12/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

18/12/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: We're concluding today's session, and I look forward to picking up tomorrow with this fantastic energy! 🚀
