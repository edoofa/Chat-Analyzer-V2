16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Blessing!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 599 2273: Morning. As Blessing's parent i am prepared for the sessions.
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know the timings that you would opt for?
16/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 599 2273: 8.30am to 9.30am
16/09/23, 10:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am.
16/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 599 2273: Sure
16/09/23, 12:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, then.

20/09/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 599 2273: Morning yes I am ready
20/09/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Blessing's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Blessing's application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from her counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of  her application, particularly her desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
20/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263775992273 I am waiting for your response on this.
20/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 599 2273: Yes Blessing she is willing to study abroad
20/09/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/09/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 599 2273: I am aware of Earn while you learn but I am not sure about its team objectives.
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 599 2273: Noted
20/09/23, 9:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263775992273 I hope that you have gone through it, and I would request you to please be responsive as it's about Blessing's EWYL Journey's base.
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 599 2273: Waal impressive
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

20/09/23, 10:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 599 2273: Following
20/09/23, 10:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things Blessing is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

25/09/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Blessing is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on her behalf, or she can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once she is back from school.
25/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 599 2273: Blessing for now she can not be active because she doesn't have phone at school so as from 15th of November she will be able to participate in the sessions as for Time I suggest this morning session will be ok.
25/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright.

25/09/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Blessing has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
25/09/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
25/09/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help Blessing fund your higher education.

The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build Blessing's personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.

08/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday🌟
Hope you are well.

Let's begin today's amazing session!
08/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 438 0324: Good morning
08/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 438 0324: Sorry im Facing some network challenges  buh we can begin our session <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I am happy to see your determination for the sessions despite metwork challenges.
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*BLESSING/ADITI*
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
08/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

08/12/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 438 0324: Ok,thank you
08/12/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/12/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 438 0324: Ok I have some school heads contacts
16/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
16/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
16/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 438 0324: Noted

16/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 438 0324: So I will share this after the school heads reply to my first message right?
16/12/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
16/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 438 0324: Ok I have connected with 3 school heads right now and I'm still waiting for them to reply
16/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

19/12/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
19/12/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
19/12/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/12/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
19/12/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
