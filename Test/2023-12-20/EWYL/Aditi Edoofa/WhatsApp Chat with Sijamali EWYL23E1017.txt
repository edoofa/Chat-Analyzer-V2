Here's a festive riddle to spark curiosity: *What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?*

Excited to reveal the answer and dive into our discussion!

19/12/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

19/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/12/23, 9:04 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much
19/12/23, 9:08 am - +260 97 6058891: My long term goals are to acquire a quality education in engineering that will lead to a good paying job that will empower me to support the less privileged in my family and my community in general
19/12/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals! Your commitment to acquiring a quality education in engineering and using it to make a positive impact in your family and community is admirable. It's clear that you have a strong sense of purpose, aiming not only for personal success but also to uplift others. The path you've chosen is significant, and I'm here to support you as you work towards achieving these goals. 🚀
19/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much for acknowledging my goals and ambition
19/12/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 96 2284130: Thank you very much.  And as a family we welcome you too.
19/12/23, 9:32 am - +260 96 2284130: Am very excited that my son has reached this far and is now an Edoofian👏🏾👏🏾

19/12/23, 9:35 am - +260 97 6058891: No I do not
19/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 6058891: May you explain further on the objectives
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 9:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
19/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6058891: Well explained and I understand clearly
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
19/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much..I'm also looking forward to it
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing! <This message was edited>
