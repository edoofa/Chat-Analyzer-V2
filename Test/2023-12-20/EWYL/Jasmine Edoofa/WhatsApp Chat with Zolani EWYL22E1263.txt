Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

17/08/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 806 8323: The grant amount is 1000 and it will be distributed to four years time hence 250 per year. The grant will remain valid only when I meet the desired conditions. The conditions include attending the EWYL sessions diligently(75% +), paying the School fees on time and attending school (75% +)
17/08/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Following
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Please enlighten me
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Thank you very much

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

*Date: 27/11/2023*

27/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, Zolani!

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 806 8323: I sure am
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge, that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $250 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes I remember
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Attendance in school should be above 75%

School fees should be paid in time
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 806 8323: OK
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Okay I guess I'll redeem the grant.. It sure is higher
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Okay
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 5:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Since we have not completed the session, I will schedule one more session tomorrow. Make sure you are on time. 
Goodnight!
27/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Okay
28/11/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon* @917208572373

*IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*

May I know do you remember yesterday's conversation?
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes I do
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Ok
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.

29/11/23, 8:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _Good Morning Zolani,_
I hope you are in great spirits. 

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪
29/11/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 806 8323: Noted
29/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*
It's time for the session. 

Quickly come and address your presence.
29/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 806 8323: I'm here
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 353 4345: I am not happy madam on the above marks considering that we stated that Zolani has a lot of modules at school, should he abscond school and come for EWYL or shouldn't you reschedule the time table to accommodate school lessons?
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We were in the midst of the training; let's finish that first.
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 353 4345: As a parent our goal is for Zolani to have a better education
29/11/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, I fully understand. However, I'd like to highlight that webinars are held once every two weeks in the evening, aligning with Zolani's schedule after completing his classes. Additionally, Zolani and I meet once a week, either on Wednesday evening or Saturday.

I believe that if a student is dedicated to learning and gaining exposure, this timetable represents the minimum commitment expected. Could you please share your thoughts on whether you find this timetable challenging?
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Honestly we might not say but compared to other programs, mine is the most demanding... You find that I reach home at around 6 and then have to immediately engage on EWYL lessons
29/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 353 4345: I think as the Edoofa team you need to be very considerate on such issues as well. He should be given ample time to perform better in everything. I know Zolani is a very intelligent student given the adequate opportunity.
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I completely agree with you but I would really want you to tell me is this too much to ask for from a student?
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 353 4345: How many times has he not attended the lessons? The above chart says he has attended only once in 6 lessons?
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Webinars are not arranged exclusively for Zolani but for all students. If he happens to miss them, it's ultimately Zolani who misses out. I emphasize the importance of webinars for Zolani because, as a mentor, I understand the significant impact such events can have on his personality and overall development.
29/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 353 4345: Is it his fault or the school timetable he was handed by the university
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, This data is only for September and October 

I planned to meet Zolani only 6 times in two months by bing considerate of his studies but he missed 5 sessions out of 6.
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 353 4345: Okay then I am hoping for your consideration in planning. You can continue with your lesson
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Okay may we proceed with the lesson
29/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we dive in, let me do a quick recap. 🔄

First up, we chatted about the $300 plan, right?
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes we did
29/11/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Then came the cool training about the 300$ plan, and congratulations, you're now an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader!* 🎓🌟
Are we on the same page?
29/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Yes we are
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 806 8323: It is
29/11/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great. Now that you've wrapped up your training, a friendly face from our Student Welfare team will be in touch for your signature on the certificate. Once that's done, you'll officially be an Edoofa Certified Student Leader.


May I know if have you understood everything so far?
29/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Noted thank you
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's delve into the discussion about a platform truly rooted in the 21st century—a space cherished by professionals worldwide. Yep, I'm talking about *LinkedIn*
29/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Following
29/11/23, 3:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sure you must have heard about it. Could you kindly share what comes to mind when you think about LinkedIn? What's your take on this professional playground?
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 806 8323: It's an employment scouting platform
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, It's like this cool digital space where professionals hang out. Imagine it as an online hub where people talk about jobs, careers, and all things work-related.
29/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Fantastic
29/11/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, LinkedIn can be a game-changer for your professional journey. Here are some things you can achieve:
29/11/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1. Network Building: Connect with people in your industry, colleagues, and potential employers. It's like a virtual networking event!

2. Job Opportunities: Many companies post job openings on LinkedIn. Your dream job might just be a connection away. 

3. Showcasing Your Skills: Build a profile that highlights your skills and experience. It's like an online resume that everyone can see.

4. Learning and Development: Follow influencers, join groups, and stay updated on industry trends. It's a great way to keep learning.

5. Visibility: Share your thoughts, achievements, and updates. It helps you stay on the radar of your professional connections.
29/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Following
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, whether you're job hunting, looking to connect, or just wanting to stay in the loop, LinkedIn is a powerful tool! 🚀🌐
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, do you have an account on LinkedIn?
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 806 8323: No
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So first of all, I would want you to create an account on LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Definitely
30/11/23, 10:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon* @263788068323 @263773534345 @917208572373 
I hope you are doing well. 
_*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*
It's time for your session

Kindly confirm your presence
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 353 4345: Present
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we talked about the Grant
Do you remember?
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 353 4345: Yes
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 353 4345: That is great
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 353 4345: Yes ma'am
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 353 4345: I understand very much
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Okay okay
30/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 806 8323: Noted
30/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
30/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 806 8323: I'm ready
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 806 8323: I guess everything is achievable from what I see
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
01/12/23, 5:44 am - +263 78 806 8323: Noted thank you
02/12/23, 1:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*

09/12/23, 7:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 7:43 am - +263 78 806 8323: Thank you for the results ✨✨❤️

*At this point, I would really appreciate it if the parents @263788068323 @263773534345 could step in and justify the student's absence from the EWYL Program session*.

09/12/23, 11:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

13/12/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
