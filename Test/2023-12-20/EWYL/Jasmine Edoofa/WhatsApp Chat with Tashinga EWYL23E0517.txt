My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. 21-08-2023 from 8:30 am to 09:30 am, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
19/08/23, 8:36 am - +27 79 803 5710: Good morning Ms Jasmine. I'm Tashinga's father and it's wonderful to know you. Unfortunately Tashinga will only be able to respond after 2:30pm today as he has back to back weekend lessons till then. Allow us to chat at that time so he can also put an input into the time schedule for Monday.
19/08/23, 9:46 am - +27 73 199 8986: Morning Ms Jasmine, as Tashinga's mother am pleased to know you will be helping us on our journey in the EWYL program. We will be glad to discuss with you at the time and date we are going to agree on when Tashinga is available. Thank you.
19/08/23, 4:33 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine,yes I'll be available for the session on Monday
21/08/23, 7:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good morning, Tashinga!_* ☺️
I hope this message finds you well and ready to conquer the day. As the sun rises on another opportunity-filled morning, *I wanted to remind you of our session scheduled for today from 8:30 am to 9:30 am.* I'm truly looking forward to our time together, where we'll dive into exciting discussions and learning experiences.

Before we embark on our session, I'd like to extend my apologies for not being available yesterday. As you know, Sundays are when our organization remains closed. However, today is a new day, and I'm excited to connect with you and continue our journey of growth and discovery.
24/08/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good morning!_* ☺️

I'm excited to connect with you and continue our journey of growth and discovery. Kindly be on time.
24/08/23, 9:20 am - +27 79 803 5710: Good morning Jasmine. It's Tashinga's father. Tashinga is out of range but as soon as he comes in he will respond.
24/08/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I hope you're doing well. Thank you for reaching out.
24/08/23, 9:21 am - +27 79 803 5710: We are mam. Thank you so much.
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The session is coming to an end now. It has been wonderful conversing with you, and I look forward to our next meeting tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.
Take care until then!
24/08/23, 9:28 am - +27 73 743 6250: Good morning
24/08/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Let us meet tomorrow Tashinga
29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 1:56 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Good afternoon mam. Thank you for the insightful information about the Festival of Rakhi and letting us know that tomorrow there will be no sessions. Additionally we would like to apologize on behalf of Tashinga as he got home late last night as he had an afternoon session paper, the same applies today therefore he will not be able to communicate with you. Tomorrow he is not writing any exam and would have communicated but he will try to communicate late tonight letting you know when he will be able to have sessions from now going forth. Thank you.
31/08/23, 8:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good  Morning,* 
I hope you are doing well.

15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
17/09/23, 6:36 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good evening,I apologize for the late reply,I just have a lot on my plate,I have exams and extra classes filling up my schedule but I feel the first option will work
17/09/23, 6:50 pm - +27 73 743 6250: If possible the one that starts at 1:30pm to 2:30pm ,this would be perfect because that is when my parents are available
22/09/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Everyone
22/09/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you all doing?
22/09/23, 2:38 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon we are doing well thank you and yourself?
22/09/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since today, the session time is over. I would like to schedule your sessions for Monday. Would that be okay?
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I'm glad you're well
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes Monday is perfect
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we will meet on Monday. Take Care
22/09/23, 3:00 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you,take care as well
29/09/23, 5:04 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good day Mrs Jasmine,I just wanted to find out if all is well because we didn't have our session on Monday
05/10/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon, acknowledged ma'am
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:52 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you,please to meet you Ms Jasmine,I hope we have a wonderful journey together as you mentor me through this journey
05/10/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I do understand the objectives, the objectives are to have work experience and to decrease financial costs  while I study.
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Tashinga is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
05/10/23, 2:04 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank for elaborating,I understand
05/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - +27 73 743 6250: This is amazing
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
05/10/23, 2:23 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I'm glad to hear that.It's nice to know how Edoofa supports young minds and guides it's students step by step to success, everyone I've interacted with from Edoofa is helpful and kind,I'd love to express my gratitude for that
05/10/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that.
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up for today. We will definitely connect tomorrow at 2:00 pm. 
Have a great day!
05/10/23, 3:25 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you,same to you
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Tashinga, can we proceed with the session?
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I'm glad to hear that
06/10/23, 2:05 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes we can
06/10/23, 2:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing about the team. Do you remember?
06/10/23, 2:07 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I do remember
06/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/10/23, 2:09 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Noted 🙂
06/10/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them after the session and let me know once you have read them.
07/10/23, 7:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I definitely will let you know when I'm done reading
06/10/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can read the newsletter after the sessions as well.
06/10/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/10/23, 2:17 pm - +27 73 743 6250: These are great goals and I look forward to them
06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
06/10/23, 2:21 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes it will be okay
07/10/23, 7:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tashinga can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes we are on the same page
07/10/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
07/10/23, 4:10 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon
I'm doing great thanks and you ?
09/10/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
09/10/23, 2:29 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Afternoon, mam. We are doing well and yourself?
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
May I know that can we have a short session?
09/10/23, 2:40 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon
09/10/23, 2:40 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes we can
09/10/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if you are available for attending sessions twice a week?
09/10/23, 2:42 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I am available for attending the sessions
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey

09/10/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
09/10/23, 2:55 pm - +27 73 743 6250: noted
09/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
09/10/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
09/10/23, 3:01 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Ohh so that's where we'll be communicating from now ?

09/10/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
09/10/23, 3:07 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I will definitely do so
09/10/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

16/10/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofians

I hope you had a productive week and enjoyed our lesson on Wednesday. As part of our ongoing commitment to personal growth and self-improvement, I'd like you to take a moment to reflect on the key takeaways from the lesson. Identify one specific goal you want to achieve based on our discussions. Be sure to make it SMART. Lastly, identify one significant distraction that you are willing to remove or reduce to bolster your focus and productivity.

Let's reconvene next week to discuss our progress, share our experiences, and support each other in our personal development journeys. I look forward to hearing from you and working together to achieve our goals.

Best regards,
