29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 505 4476: Whaaal good to hear that. Wishing you a happy and great day tomorrow

31/08/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.

31/08/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
31/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 412 2571: It is a program that I will be doing can earn while you pay program  this would be used to reduce the amounts that I will encounter  there such as my fees these program will be done online

Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.
31/08/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It would be best if you allocate today's time to go through the attached document along with your family. It is essential that you read each and every detail attentively, taking your time to fully comprehend the information provided. So, are you ready for the document?

3. What does a student’s journey look like with the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
4. Write in detail about one of the student’s testimonials.
01/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 412 2571: Ok
01/09/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the inconvenience caused, but I must request your understanding for today. We have scheduled visits to several universities in the coming days, and an unexpected urgent meeting has arisen that requires my immediate attention. I assure you that we will make up for the missed session during our next meeting, which is scheduled for *Monday at 8:30 a.m.*

Until then, please take good care, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.
01/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 412 2571: Ok
01/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 412 2571: As for me I will be going to school on Sunday and we will have to  continue when I have finished my A level examinations  on 13 November  if that is ok.
02/09/23, 8:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Takudzwa. 
Thank you for reaching out to me and telling me about your schedule. I will keep a note of this. Have a lovely days ahead.
02/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 412 2571: Thank you

15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Good evening.

 Yes Takudzwa is at school right now and they are not allowed to use phones at school therefore I will have to sacrifice for his sessions though I will be at work also.  I will try to liase with my workmates for the 2 hrs. 

Therefore slot me on Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday 1:30 to 2:30pm

Thank you.
18/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 505 4476: I think the EWYL team's objectives are to help students to climb to the highest level of learning as they help students to adapt well when they move from one country to another and learning new culture , to grow and learn well.
18/09/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Takudzwa is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Ok. Thank you
18/09/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Lessening the burden of parents. I understand
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Fine. Hie Ms Sanjana. How are doing.

Am Mercy Kamoto, Takudzwa's mother. I will be standing in for Takudzwa as he is away at school and preparing for his final A level exams soon.
18/09/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
18/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Noted
18/09/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
18/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Ok. So am will be responding for him will he be able to follow you up as the will evaluate me and not Takudzwa himself
18/09/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am expecting that you will tell about what we have shared today with Takudzwa.
18/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 505 4476: I will have to share with him the chats so that he will understand it better
18/09/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Takudzwa to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe students will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Yaaa very interesting but still the problem stands. Am at home and Takudzwa is at boarding school away were no phones are allowed. How then can this happen without disturbing his exams and the teachers will not allow this.
18/09/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once, he is back then you can make him read these conversations so that he can also understand about the program.
18/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Ok I will
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Uuum quite interesting and very educative.
19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Sorry was a little busy. Am now ready
19/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Takudzwa’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Takudzwa?
19/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Great
19/09/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
19/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Yes it's fine
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I now is it clear?
19/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Very clear
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Takudzwa can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead!
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 505 4476: Thank you so much. Same to you

08/12/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
