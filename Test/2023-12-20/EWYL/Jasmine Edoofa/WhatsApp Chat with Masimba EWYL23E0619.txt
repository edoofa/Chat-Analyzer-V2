FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*

18/09/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Alright I understand
18/09/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
18/09/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
18/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Okay noted
18/09/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
18/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Alright
18/09/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Noted ma'am
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/09/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.
18/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Wonderful, awe inspiring. I am a proud Edoofian
18/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Yes I will do so
18/09/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, It was lovely talking to you. Have a great day ahead!
18/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 476 1673: Same to you ma'am. Thank you
20/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning my dear student*_
