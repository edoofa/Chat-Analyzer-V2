29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Tadiwanashe
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Yes, a full-on break!

If you ever want to connect with me during the break, just drop me a message in our EWYL GROUP between 6-8 pm. If I need to share any updates during the break, I'll be reaching out every alternate day during this time. So, make sure you're around and ready to catch up on those days.

*Now, since it's a break, I don't want to stress you out with goals. Instead, I want to know what YOU want to do.* How many applications are you planning to submit when we kick back into gear on January 6th?

Wishing you the happiest of holidays, filled with joy, relaxation, and moments of warmth. I'll undoubtedly miss our interactions, but I'm eagerly looking forward to reconnecting on January 6th. 🌲🎁
