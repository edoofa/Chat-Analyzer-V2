21/03/23, 8:00 am - You were added
15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 950 9347: How have you been ma'am
15/09/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Profound idea ma'am
15/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 950 9347: I'll go with the first slot 8:30 to 9:30
17/09/23, 11:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Brendon
Do you mean 8:30 - 9:30 on Saturdays?
17/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Both Saturday and during the week,,
17/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 950 9347: Good evening ma'am

How are you doing? It's time for the session.
29/09/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

03/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

Have you ever heard about the incredible feat of _Felix Baumgartner_, who jumped from the edge of space and landed safely in New Mexico? It's a remarkable testament to human courage and the thirst for exploration. Let's channel that spirit into our week ahead and reach for the stars in our own way! 🚀🌠
*So, are you ready for the session?*
12/10/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
16/10/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Brendon and Parents* @263779509347 @263774364881 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263779509347 @263774364881* 
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Brendon*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Brendon* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
18/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 436 4881: Good morning thank you for contacting sorry for not responding for a while on Brendon's behalf he's now busy with his final A level examinations. Yes if there's network connection on Saturday l think we can have that session
