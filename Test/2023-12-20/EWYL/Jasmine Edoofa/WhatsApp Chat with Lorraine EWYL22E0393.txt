Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

29/08/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

14/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Lorraine,*

I trust you're doing well. It was disheartening not to see you on the call yesterday. I want to emphasize that our meetings occur just once a week, and yesterday's call was scheduled for only 30 minutes. I believe it's reasonable to allocate at least 30 minutes from your week.
Moreover, I've noticed your absence from several recent sessions, and it's raising concerns about your commitment to the EWYL Program and earning credits. 

Do you want me to assume that you may not be as serious about it?
16/12/23, 12:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_🧾
_Get ready for an exciting Saturday activity this week!_🛣️
Inspired by timeless tales of honesty and hard work, we're inviting you to unleash the writer within you. *Share your creativity by crafting original stories that echo the virtues of integrity and diligence.* Whether it's a modern twist on a classic theme or an entirely new narrative, let your imagination soar.

*Submit your stories here in your EWYL GROUP*, and let's celebrate the power of storytelling together. Your unique perspectives and creativity will not only enrich our collective experience but also inspire others. This is an opportunity to showcase your literary talents and contribute to our vibrant community. We look forward to reading your stories and exploring the diverse narratives that make our community so special.
Happy Thinking🧙🏼‍♀️
19/12/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way!*_  
_*Oh, what fun it is to ride. In a one-horse open sleigh!*_  

As we stand on the threshold of the much-anticipated festive season, and considering that some of you have exams going on. After careful consideration, *I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you!*
19/12/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's holiday time! 🎉 So, here's the scoop: no sessions, no lessons, no calls, and no activities *until January 2nd, 2024*. 
Yes, a full-on break!

If you ever want to connect with me during the break, just drop me a message in our EWYL GROUP between 6-8 pm. If I need to share any updates during the break, I'll be reaching out every alternate day during this time. So, make sure you're around and ready to catch up on those days.

*Now, since it's a break, I don't want to stress you out with goals. Instead, I want to know what YOU want to do.* How many applications are you planning to submit when we kick back into gear on January 3rd?

Wishing you the happiest of holidays, filled with joy, relaxation, and moments of warmth. I'll undoubtedly miss our interactions, but I'm eagerly looking forward to reconnecting on January 3rd. 🌲🎁
