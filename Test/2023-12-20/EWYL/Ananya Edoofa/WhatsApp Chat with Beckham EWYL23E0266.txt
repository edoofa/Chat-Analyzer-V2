I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
