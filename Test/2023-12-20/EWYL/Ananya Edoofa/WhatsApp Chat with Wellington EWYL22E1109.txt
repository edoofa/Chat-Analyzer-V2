catalyst for selfdiscovery and personal growth,it also shapes your understanding of your past and helps prepare the future

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
16/08/23, 12:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above.

28/08/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to gently remind you about something important. It's regarding the $300 plan that we discussed earlier. In order to fully enjoy the benefits of this plan, it's necessary for you to have a *discussion with your parents* about it and also to write a *letter* to me.

https://youtu.be/2HfhqzlqLHY?si=ZGBW5lB4gLN6h5Y9

01/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Fantastic! Now, can you imagine how you might incorporate this AI tool into your daily routine? Are there any particular ideas or situations that come to mind?
01/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 79018 04058: Yes designing and making some pictures and logos
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! As promised and discussed during our call on Saturday, we will begin the training sessions for the *$300 plan today*! Are you ready for this?🚀
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 79018 04058: Yes
01/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 79018 04058: Noted
01/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 79018 04058: Through WhatsApp Instagram and Facebook
01/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's an effective approach! Should I share some more channels?
01/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 79018 04058: Yes, please!
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 79018 04058: Noted
01/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 79018 04058: Understood
01/11/23, 4:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
01/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 79018 04058: Okay but we just use the same information we had when we enrolled by the program right
01/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, yes that's a similar approach! It's a more professional and authentic way to proceed.
01/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 79018 04058: Understood
01/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 79018 04058: Okay noted
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 5:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
26/11/23, 5:52 am - +91 79018 04058: Okay
27/11/23, 7:49 am - +91 79018 04058: The "Spirit of Competition" to me embodies the drive to push oneself to excel, to continuously improve, and to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. It's not solely about winning, but about striving for personal excellence while respecting others' efforts.

This spirit has shaped my approach by instilling a mindset of resilience and determination. It taught me to view setbacks as learning experiences and to channel that competitive drive into improving myself rather than solely focusing on outdoing others.

In one instance, during a robotics competition where we were designing an RC car, our team faced numerous technical challenges. Instead of succumbing to frustration, the spirit of competition inspired us to persevere, collaborate, and explore innovative solutions. Through relentless dedication, we managed to rectify the issues and clinch a commendable position in the competition, demonstrating the value of persistence and teamwork in the face of adversity.
27/11/23, 11:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Wellington!🌟

Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!

29/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 79018 04058: Okay
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 79018 04058: Planning the order of the day
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wellington, guess more!
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 79018 04058: Persistence and resilience 😏🤔
29/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 79018 04058: Oh good for him what is he doing if l may ask
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success.
29/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 79018 04058: I am aware of that
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 79018 04058: Yea sure we are doing so
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :

During this period, if you ever feel like connecting with me or if I have any updates to share with you, we can connect between 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. So, make sure to spare a few minutes to acknowledge.🧑🏽‍🎄

We will resume our sessions in the first week of January. During this break, I encourage you to focus on your studies, enjoy the celebrations, and approach the exams with confidence. All the best and have fun! 🏆✨
