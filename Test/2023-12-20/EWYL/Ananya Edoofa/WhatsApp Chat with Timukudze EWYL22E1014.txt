You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details.

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

23/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
23/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
23/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
23/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
23/08/23, 10:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

14/11/23, 8:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_The festive season is over, so let's reschedule our call!_*

Time: *6:30 PM*

14/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the call!
15/11/23, 10:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

*I wanted to bring to your attention that we have our session scheduled for today from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm* 
Get ready for a rollercoaster of ideas and inspiration! 🚀🌟 
Let's make this session legendary! 🎉💪
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263712584240 @263712113598 @27641251308 

I've noticed a consistent delay in your required submissions and attendance at sessions. I want to emphasize that this approach won't help you progress effectively. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress, and at this pace, we won't be able to complete our orientation program on time.

I hope you understand the importance of a dedicated approach. Let's work together to address this and ensure your success in the program.
28/11/23, 8:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263712113598 @263712584240 @27641251308 

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Time: 6:00 PM*
28/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 71 211 3598: Good morning ma'am
28/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 71 211 3598: Okay noted ma'am
28/11/23, 8:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Timukudze, I have been trying to connect with you for a long time. May I ask why you were not responding?
28/11/23, 8:09 am - +263 71 211 3598: Sorry ma'am I have been busy with MOOC classes  we usually do them after school so that's why
28/11/23, 8:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Timukudze, it's been more than three weeks now, and I believe you could have found at least five minutes in the last three weeks to inform your mentor about your whereabouts.

You could have updated me about your courses, and we could have rescheduled our session or a call. It hurts to see the lack of reciprocation for the efforts we put in. Imagine how you would feel if I ignored your efforts and concerns.
28/11/23, 8:30 am - +27 64 125 1308: Timu what's happening please try to do good
28/11/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 211 3598: Yes ma'am I understand and I am genuinely sorry that I didn't update you about the same
28/11/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you will attend your sessions from now on.
28/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 211 3598: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Timukudze, are you ready for the discussion?
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Hello ma'am yes I'm ready
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Yes ma'am I do remember
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 258 4240: Is it 6PM Indian time or Zimbabwean time
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: IST
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am noted
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Yes ma'am it's also been a pleasure working with you
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 258 4240: Noted
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Ma'am I attended all the webinars held in September
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Yes i am
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me check with Mr Anik about this, and I will get back to you.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am
29/11/23, 7:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 7:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈
29/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am noted
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Timukudze!

 Well since you could not attend your sessions with me due to some valid reasons, Let me summarize to you what we have learned during our training.
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it.

29/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Sure ma'am
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 211 3598: no ma'am
29/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, try harder!
29/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 211 3598: I think maybe he found a certain opportunity and capitalized on it
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 211 3598: wow okay thats really great ma'am
29/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Okay ma'am noted
29/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am curious to understand the reason behind your absence from the session today.

It's just that we connect only once a week, and that too late in the evening after all your classes. Even after that, you are not attending your sessions; it's an alarming situation for me and I want to know the reason so that I can help you with that.
12/12/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Timukudze!

As promised, I am sharing your progress report for November!t

12/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 211 3598: Good evening ma'am

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽
