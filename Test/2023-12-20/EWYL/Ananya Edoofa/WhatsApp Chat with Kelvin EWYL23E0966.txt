06/12/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 986 0810: It's a tricky one is it a computer keyboard 🤣
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you are right!🚀✨
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 83 986 0810: 😩
06/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
06/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Won nice , thank you 🙏
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
06/12/23, 2:03 pm - +27 83 986 0810: My name is Kumbirai Kelvin Tsapo.I'm 21 years old.I want to become a Computer Scientist , I like to develop my own apps.I love to play Chess.
06/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's awesome that you're aiming to become a Computer Scientist. Developing your own apps is a fantastic goal! 

 Also, Chess is a great game, isn't it? Do you have a favorite opening?🚀
06/12/23, 2:08 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes black 😁
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, alright!Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Can you state them please
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes I heard that one.
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session here, and I can't wait to connect with you in our next session tomorrow!

Meanwhile, check out this incredible post on our page, and don't miss the comment section! 🥳

07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 3:39 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Good afternoon how are you
07/12/23, 3:40 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I have never head of this

08/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kelvin

11/12/23, 1:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:36 pm - +27 83 986 0810: 🤝
11/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Ok
11/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Thank you for the introduction
11/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Great 👊
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Interesting
11/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
11/12/23, 2:15 pm - +27 83 986 0810: All sections are interesting, for me I can go with the 3 Quotes.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 83 986 0810: It is
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, kelvin?
11/12/23, 2:31 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Sounds awesome
11/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights! 

Now let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Good day!☀️

12/12/23, 12:54 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Greetings 🙏
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Ok
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Edoofa EWYL program has been an instrument in providing higher education which is accessible , affordable and makes students to be employable after they completed their studies.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have you noticed the projects under your EWYL program?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes I have noticed them
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Corporate Alliances project is to understand the market I am going to work in  , in the future and start preparing myself for it at a very early stage . Due to the pandemic which hit across the globe , businesses moved their operations online . I have to start a LinkedIn account where I indentify jobs on that platform then I applied for them .if I managed to get a job I connect the company to the Edoofa so that they can help me. I will identify my family and friends who can connect me to companies who will help me to get a job in my own country when I finish my studies
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Kelvin I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes will do that
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I will do that thank you
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great session! As you wrap up, remember the exciting opportunities EWYL projects offer for earning credit. Your dedication is key to success. Dive into these projects, showcase your skills, and watch your efforts pay off academically.

12/12/23, 2:47 pm - +27 71 707 0139: The guide for searching companies which can help on the programme of EWYL firstly you check the Nature of company  , the company must be either student _ centric for example the career development platforms or ed_tech platforms.It could also be a recreational platform for example virtual ,gaming platforms, podcasts and musical apps.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +27 71 707 0139: You must also check the scale of the company . the companies selected must not be too big or too small . It must have employee size of 50 to 200. I must also consider the company's financial stability so that it can manage to help with the funding.I also have to check the background of the founder if the founder has a strong background in terms of experience and qualifications
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Kelvin!

14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Afternoon how are you. Let's start
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - +27 81 002 7935: If given the chance, I would choose to step into the shoes of Sherlock Holmes from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. I'd immerse myself in solving intricate mysteries, utilising Holmes' keen deductive skills to uncover the truth behind puzzling cases. The thrill of solving enigmatic crimes and the intellectual stimulation would make for an exhilarating day in the life of the great detective.
14/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Sherlock Holmes, is a great choice!🤝🏽
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - +27 81 002 7935: Thank you
14/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Kelvin, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kelvin!
14/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude today's session, let's recharge for tomorrow's journey. We'll connect again at 1:30 PM with enthusiasm and dedication. Remember: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. Looking forward to our continued progress!
14/12/23, 2:50 pm - +27 81 002 7935: Thank you
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Kelvin!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 2:01 pm - +27 81 002 7935: That’s interesting 🤔
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kelvin, why are you late today?
15/12/23, 2:04 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Sorry we were out of the house so network was problem
15/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you manage to listen to this audio?
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +27 81 002 7935: That’s correct
15/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 81 002 7935: The project requires finding another student who passed their A-levels, and telling them about Edoofa. This includes all information including the EWYL program, and then asking them if they’re interested in applying. The student’s details will be shared with Edoofa if they are interested
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Ok thank will connect on Monday
18/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Kelvin!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Sorry can we do it another time we are busy in town
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Kelvin! Let me share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students! <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

18/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:14 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Still talking to friends but they are facing challenges of the money to pay
18/12/23, 8:15 pm - +27 71 707 0139: But we are trying our best
19/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Kelvin! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 2:19 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Aah I haven't heard of that story of hanging stockings by the fire that's funny
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I think I had understood everything so there is nothing I need assistance
19/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kelvin, why are you late today?
19/12/23, 2:33 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Kelvin is in Zimbabwe so network is very bad there
19/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so may I ask how are going to manage your sessions?
19/12/23, 2:39 pm - +27 71 707 0139: We will try but if you can give us a break until we come back
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kelvin, I am sharing today's session reading material with you!
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

They will start with their former schools   so that other students will also benefit with this programme
