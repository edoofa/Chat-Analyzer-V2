13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sure
13/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Here's to the beginning of a beautiful journey together 🥂. I'm sure I'll enjoy the experience
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Thanks for the introduction. Looking forward to a fruitful working relationship
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
13/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: So... I'm Adelaide Takura Sithole, and I'm an aspiring chemical engineer. I'm all about breaking stereotypes and have chosen to break the bias by joining a male dominated field. I'm an avid reader, writer and researcher. I am a passionate speaker and yeah....
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Adelaide! 🌟 
That's awesome – breaking stereotypes and diving into a male-dominated field takes serious guts. Big respect! 🚀 Chemical engineering sounds fascinating. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am very excited to begin our EWYL Hourney together. So let us connect on Friday!🌟🤝🏽
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright.  I'll be here
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon miss. I am genuinely surprised by the fact
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 653 1903: No I do not
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Ok. Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Noted ma'am
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Very interesting
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Its pretty interesting
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: The Quotes
15/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright. Have a blessed weekend
18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Adelaide

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Thank you very much
18/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sounds interesting
18/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 653 1903: I have gone through the document ma'am
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sure
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, I was having a conversation with the admissions team, and I came to know that you are about to receive an offer letter from the university! How are you feeling? Are you excited?
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Nervous
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 653 1903: How many offers can I expect?

18/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Sorry miss, I am still not answered. I do understand I'll get help with choosing the best offer, but how many offers should I expect in the first place
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Excuse me, Adelaide, that I missed your message. The number of offer letters is based on the number of applications that have been submitted to the university and which one of them has accepted your application.

If you wish to understand how your application is being processed or evaluated by the university, I would suggest you connect with the admissions team, as they are the best people to guide you through this.
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am thank you
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, while I was connecting with the admissions team today, they mentioned that there was a scheduled discussion with you on Friday, but you did not attend. Can I know if there is something that is bothering you?
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 218 8531: Good afternoon Ms Ananya.

While I might not always be an active participant in all the discussions, I am closely monitoring the progress of this program and I have taken it upon myself to ensure that Adelaide is available for all the scheduled sessions. I seem to have missed where it was mentioned that there was a scheduled session with the admissions team. The appointment i had diarised for Friday was with you. My apologies if indeed we missed a scheduled session. We were just unaware of the said appointment. We currently have no issues that may hinder our participation in this journey.
18/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Apologies. I  was unaware that I had a session with the admissions team on Friday. I assumed the only session was with you
19/12/23, 7:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263786531903 @263772188531 

That is completely alright, I was just concerned if you are facing any challenges!
19/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 653 1903: We are not. Good morning
19/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Adelaide! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon ma'am. Yesterday you said to share my understanding of the 3 projects in the document and I did. May I please get feedback on my responses and advice on a way forward

19/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 653 1903: Thank you.
19/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
19/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: I have gone through the audio
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: It's reiterating the objectives of project 1
19/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 653 1903: I am to identify local companies and reach out to the decision makers via LinkedIn or email in them to create an alliance with Edoofa
