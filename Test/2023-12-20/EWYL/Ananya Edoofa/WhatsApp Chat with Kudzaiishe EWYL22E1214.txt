04/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 073 6678: September 5th
05/08/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that you have been quite occupied with your preparations. However, I would still appreciate it if you stay connected on your EWYL Line.

So, kindly follow your EWYL ritual so that I can share your activities with you!
05/08/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 073 6678: That is alright ma'am
12/08/23, 11:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 073 6678: Good morning Ms Ananya.
Thank you very much with the letter, we will be available on the 16th of August
12/08/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
15/08/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟
16/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Good afternoon ma'am
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 073 6678: I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Yes, I'm following
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Since you explained, yes i am
16/08/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Thank you very much
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 073 6678: That's very kind of you
Thank you for the motivation ma'am
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Thank you
16/08/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 073 6678: However i had a few questions which i did not find in the FAQ document
16/08/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, you can write them down and we can discuss that tomorrow!
16/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 073 6678: That is alright
16/08/23, 3:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
16/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 073 6678: Thank you very much ma'am
16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 354 4518: Indeed we're thrilled Ms Ananya. We are very grateful. The grant goes a long way in lessening our fees burden thereby adding towards Kudzaiishe's academic dream fulfilment.

18/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 073 6678: Thank you
18/08/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I want to let you know that there's something we need to address concerning your grant. I need to tell you that today is the last day to submit the signed grant document.

I still have not received a confirmation. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?

03/10/23, 8:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:23 pm - +91 73036 42433: That is alright ma’am I understand
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

08/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes noted indeed
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*

I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 73036 42433: Okay
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 73036 42433: Back in Zimbabwe 
In High Schools
08/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
08/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 73036 42433: Okay okay
Noted
08/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes yes i hear you
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.

Did you read those sample questions?
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes i did
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 73036 42433: That’s alright 
I will do so
08/11/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 4:23 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes yes i went through this
08/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 73036 42433: Okay okay 
Yes indeed I understand
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 73036 42433: That is perfectly fine
08/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

24/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Kudzaiishe!

I was expecting to hear from you as it's your session time to discuss the grant. May I ask if you are available?
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 73036 42433: Hello ma’am
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 73036 42433: We can proceed
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: During our last session, we were discussing if you can recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes we talked about linkedin
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kudzaiishe, i am talking about the discussion we were having about the Grant.
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 73036 42433: Ok
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 73036 42433: Not quite
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 73036 42433: Okay
24/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
24/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
24/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 73036 42433: Indeed ma’am
24/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
24/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
24/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 73036 42433: Okay I’m following
24/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:28 pm - +91 73036 42433: At?
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 73036 42433: Ok
24/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
24/11/23, 4:36 pm - +91 73036 42433: That’s alright 
I will try as much as possible to
24/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 4:45 pm - +91 73036 42433: I hear you
25/11/23, 10:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kudzaiishe!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion yesterday. Let us connect at 6:00 PM today to move forward with our discussion.
25/11/23, 10:56 am - +91 73036 42433: Unfortunately today ma’am at 6 i may not be available
25/11/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can I know why Kudzaiishe?
25/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023
26/11/23, 7:43 am - +91 73036 42433: Owkay
27/11/23, 11:34 am - +91 73036 42433: The "spirit of competition" refers to the attitude and approach individuals or teams adopt when participating in a competitive activity. It embodies the principles of fairness, sportsmanship, and respect for one's opponents. The spirit of competition emphasizes the pursuit of excellence, the desire to improve, and the willingness to engage in a contest with integrity.

Elements of the spirit of competition include Fairness. Competitors are expected to adhere to the rules and regulations governing the activity and treat all participants equitably. Displaying good sportsmanship means demonstrating respect, grace, and dignity throughout the competition. 

The spirit of competition encourages participants to strive for their personal best and push their limits. It involves focusing on self-improvement, setting high standards, and showcasing exceptional skills, talent, and effort.

While competition often involves rivalry and the desire to outperform opponents, the spirit of competition also recognizes the importance of camaraderie. It acknowledges that healthy competition can foster relationships, forge strong bonds, and create a shared sense of purpose among competitors.

With addition of my own personal experience in the spirit of competition, can highlight that  as i reached India, i had the chance to train Basketball with some of the esteemed players of the country, players who have played on high level, but I believe the spirit pf integrity and persistence has led me to the position i am in right now. I now see myself at a different level and currently playing for the University team shows a step into embracing the spirit of competition at the utmost level.

Over and above all, the spirit of competition promotes a positive and constructive environment where individuals or teams can test their abilities, learn from each other, and grow both personally and professionally. It celebrates the pursuit of excellence while emphasizing fair play, respect, and integrity.
27/11/23, 11:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Kudzaiishe! 🌟🏆Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
27/11/23, 12:08 pm - +91 73036 42433: Thank you very much
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

🔗 *Webinar Link:* https://meet.google.com/cdf-yari-kzc

Also, here is a reminder for our *weekly* WhatsApp *chat session tomorrow at  8 PM*. Excited to catch up with you, so be sure to join on time!⌛
09/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:31 pm - +91 73036 42433: Hello Ma'am
09/12/23, 4:35 pm - +91 73036 42433: I'm thinking of Wind
09/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The answer to the riddle "I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?" is a cloud. Clouds float in the sky, they can obscure the sun (creating darkness), and they release rain (or "cry") without having eyes.
09/12/23, 4:37 pm - +91 73036 42433: 😂😂Okay, it makes sense now
09/12/23, 4:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to update your LinkedIn profile?
09/12/23, 4:48 pm - +91 73036 42433: Yes my LinkedIn account is updated
09/12/23, 4:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, that's amazing! I will check. Now, for today's session, I want you to start working toward your internships!

For that, the first step is to create a well-formed resume. May I ask if you have a resume?
09/12/23, 4:51 pm - +91 73036 42433: I have created several of them i'm not sure if i have them now
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you share any one of those with me?
09/12/23, 4:55 pm - +91 73036 42433: I have just looked for them now, unfortunately i have no copies with me, i must have left some of the files back in Zimbabwe
09/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I am sharing a video with you today, watch it, understand and start creating your own resume. 

https://youtu.be/aArb68OBFPg?si=f7X5X1ii-K2U1s0_
09/12/23, 4:58 pm - +91 73036 42433: Alright ma'am
09/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly watch this video, and let me know what you have understood.
09/12/23, 5:07 pm - +91 73036 42433: Ok
09/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding our session today, and you can share your updated resume with me by Monday or Tuesday so that I can help you with it. Here is your Saturday activity!
09/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

As promised, I am sharing your progress report for November!
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
13/12/23, 1:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday!_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only 13 days left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁✨

Let me spill some tea – one of our rockstar students flipped his eligibility from "not eligible" to "grant-ready" last month! How, you ask? By showing up to every call, putting in his 100% on projects, and making it happen. 🌟
18/12/23, 12:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I get it, exams are breathing down your necks, but fear not! Our meetings maybe once a week, but let's make every second count. 🕰️

Guess what? Our team completely understands the holiday excitement mixed with exam stress bubbling inside you. Forget about waiting for Santa – I've got some thrilling news to share!🎄🎁

A serving of holiday cheer is here, as we have decided to disperse your sessions for the next two weeks! During this period, if you ever feel like connecting with me or if I have any updates to share with you, we can connect between 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. So, make sure to spare a few minutes to acknowledge.🧑🏽‍🎄

We will resume our sessions in the first week of January. During this break, I encourage you to focus on your studies, enjoy the celebrations, and approach the exams with confidence. All the best and have fun! 🏆✨
