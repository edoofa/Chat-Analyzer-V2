12/08/23, 10:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟

I hope you're doing well. I want to let you know that there's something we need to address concerning your grant. It seems like there hasn't been any progress in attending the grant discussion or signing the grant document.

I know that things can get busy, causing delays sometimes. I'm here to help if you need it. However, I need to tell you that today is the last day for submitting the signed grant document. If you can't meet this deadline for any reason, there's a chance that we might have to cancel the grant.

28/08/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to gently remind you about something important. It's regarding the $300 plan that we discussed earlier. In order to fully enjoy the benefits of this plan, it's necessary for you to have a *discussion with your parents* about it and also to write a *letter* to me.
28/08/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Please keep in mind that I'll need to share the finalized list with the department *tomorrow morning*. I genuinely care about your success and don't want you to miss this opportunity. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
28/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 319 8550: I will have a discussion  with my parents and they will give an  update
28/08/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, what about the letter?
28/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 319 8550: Let me  finalize that
28/08/23, 11:40 pm - +263 78 877 6841: Greetings all,
Sorry slow back. The 300 dollar plan is certainly a good opportunity for students, however l suggest that she should sorely focus on her studies for now and possibly you can come up with another option if ok with you.  
Many thanks
29/08/23, 7:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263788776841 

While I completely understand your concerns about her studies, I believe that these projects offer more than just additional commitments. In fact, they can greatly contribute to her personal growth and development in several ways.

Firstly, these projects have the potential to nurture her independence. By taking on these responsibilities, she will have the opportunity to learn how to manage her time effectively and balance different tasks. This skill is invaluable in real life and can significantly enhance her ability to excel not only in academics but also in her future endeavors.
29/08/23, 7:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, engaging in these projects can substantially boost her self-confidence. Accomplishing tasks outside of her usual routine and comfort zone will help her realize her own capabilities. Witnessing her own achievements will instill a sense of pride and confidence that can positively impact her overall attitude towards challenges.

Additionally, these projects will provide a platform for her to hone her communication skills. Effective communication is a skill that transcends academia and plays a pivotal role in personal and professional success.
29/08/23, 7:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that your daughter can achieve all these remarkable benefits by dedicating just 2-3 hours a week to these projects. This time commitment is intentionally designed to be flexible and manageable, allowing her to maintain her focus on her studies while still reaping the rewards of these extracurricular activities.

Social media can be a great tool for staying connected and informed. With an Instagram account, you'll be able to see what we're up to, get event updates, and even connect with your peers.

But remember, it's completely optional!  It's just a cool way to enhance your experience and keep up with all the happenings. If you decide to give it a try, we're here to help you get started. If not, no worries at all! Your choice. 😊

Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.

Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.

08/11/23, 4:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

25/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL
