12/10/23, 1:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, that is alright!
12/10/23, 6:51 pm - ~ anotuda was added
12/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 227 1141: I am available waiting for you
12/10/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 227 1141: We wish for that too
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Very inspiring indeed
12/10/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Uuum not quite sure about them
12/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 227 1141: If I may guess it's independence and responsibility. Not sure correct me
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is partially correct!
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Prosper is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education *Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
12/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Understood
12/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
12/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

13/10/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Prosper will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

01/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I am happy to hear that!
01/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

01/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I understood that there is a platform called LinkedIn which i can use to search for companies to aim for and explain how the Edoofa scholarship program is helping me to gain necessary skills
01/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, I am glad to hear that!
01/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I also understood that i have to get back to the Edoofa team so that i can get more clarification and aid in setting up meetings and participation in them

Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
01/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok thank you ma'am

03/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I understood that one has to find companies which aim at inhancing learners skills or which promote student's growth and check the background of the company, founders, scale and donations.
The platforms include LinkedIn, Google and crunch base
03/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Greetings to you all
04/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 090 4054: Ok ma'am understood
I wish you a speady recovery
04/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 090 4054: No ma'am
07/11/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok ma'am understood
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
07/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

And you mentioned about a letter which i can use to establish conversation with with other heads
07/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

09/11/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hey Prosper!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
