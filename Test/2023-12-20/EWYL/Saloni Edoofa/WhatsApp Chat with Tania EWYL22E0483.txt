During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tania, coming to all our recent developments, guess what? While I was scrolling through LinkedIn yesterday, I stumbled upon one of our rockstar students proudly flaunting his recent certification, and the response was mind-blowing! 🌟
30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let's talk about you – have you ever crossed paths with the superhero of the professional world, LinkedIn?
30/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 70095 71088: Nooo mam l have not
30/11/23, 3:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tania you know, having a LinkedIn profile is like having a golden ticket in the professional world. It's your online resume, introducing you to potential employers and collaborators. Firstly, it showcases your experience, skills, and education, acting as a digital snapshot of your career. Secondly, it connects you with a vast network of professionals, opening doors to opportunities you might not discover elsewhere. Thirdly, it's a hub for industry insights and trends, keeping you in the loop. Moreover, it's a platform for recommendations, adding credibility to your profile. Lastly, job opportunities often pop up directly on your feed, making job hunting a breeze. In essence, LinkedIn is your personal brand's best friend, helping you shine in the professional arena. 🌐🌟
30/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 70095 71088: Yes mam I understand
30/11/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For a stellar LinkedIn profile as a first-year college student, start with a professional photo and a catchy headline that showcases your aspirations. Craft a compelling summary introducing yourself and your goals. Highlight your academic achievements and relevant coursework. Add any part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer experiences to showcase your skills. Connect with classmates, professors, and professionals in your field. Endorsements from peers can add credibility. Lastly, share posts or articles related to your interests to show engagement. Keep it polished, and you're ready to make a strong professional impression! 🌟📚
30/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 70095 71088: Noted mam
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Tania, when are your exams beginning?
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 70095 71088: I am starting on 12 December upto 4 January
30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure the preparations are going well!
30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So concluding the session with some awesome news! As I had a conversation with Mr. Anik the Career Development Officer and Ms. Sanjana, the Head of the department, guess what? We're gearing up for an exciting industrial visit backed by Edoofa! In this opportunity you will be able to grasp live and practical knowledge of so many revolutionary things happening around us.🎉
But one thing that I want to share with you personally, something that really made me think hard is that since there will be a lot of students that we have to choose from for this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, will you be able to fall in that top student's category?
30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 🤔Do ponder upon it and honestly evaluate that should you be eligible for it,  have you been consistent throughout?
30/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 70095 71088: I have tried being consistent throughout the journey mam and l hope that l would be eligible enough
02/12/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
Hope you are enjoying your first winter season in India! 🥶

I've received messages from you and other Edoofians at the University, expressing their focus on exam preparations. Considering your likely Christmas celebrations and festive engagements, the team and I thought it would be best to _relieve you from sessions until the end of December_. We plan to *resume our first session of the new year in the first week of January*. 😌
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Every week, I will connect with you for quick updates for 5-10 minutes*. Along with this, *you can share concerns with me Monday to Friday from 06:00-08:00 PM IST if needed🫶🏻*. I'll still be accepting student application forms and African school forms. If you _wish to schedule a one-on-one call for project-related doubts during this time, I'm more than happy to accommodate🫱🏻‍🫲🏼._ I hope you won't waste this time and stay focused on projects. I would appreciate it if you dedicate some time and show productivity during that period.

Best wishes, and enjoy the festive season!
