12/12/23, 9:10 am - +265 996 40 67 62: Well it was because I have a small piece work and the time I suggested was lunch time
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, I understand that. Freda, may I know if you work somewhere?

12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It’s a small piece work where I did my internship <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Sometimes they ask for my assistance when needed
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: But it’s not everyday
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This sounds fantastic Freda, can you shed more light on the role you were doing their and what was the name of the company?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Central Poultry. I was doing my research paper there because it was focusing on a production company. A lady who is the head of quality assurance management asked me to apply for quality controller role which I did for three months
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: By then I had not yet graduated
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It was quite challenging but I enjoyed working with them because I learnt a lot
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, Freda!

I am so impressed listening to that, I can't even express🫶🏻🚀
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much. I appreciate it
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m looking to everything as well
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Freda!
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Freda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. Long term goals I like to visualize myself at a managerial role or position which requires a lot skills, knowledge and experience. I plan on doing this by facing challenges or tasks head on. I love reading managerial books as well as observing current leaders and how the perform even in their decision making skills.
I believe that EWYL will help me because every skill or knowledge we acquire is also beneficial and not only will I be earning credit scores but most importantly grabbing knowledge that will also be handy
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, Freda and I assure you that I am always there with you in this journey🫶🏻🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: +265999951305 - Mr Ben Mbozi (my Father)

+265999951302-Mrs Etner Mbozi ( My Mother)
13/12/23, 9:58 am - +265 996 40 67 62: Good morning I hope everything is ok?

13/12/23, 1:36 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we can
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I believe we are all looking forward to it
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I was not able to continue further since it was the end of your session but it slipped to share the ending message with you.
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. I was wondering makes sense
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Enlighten me please
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Just excuse me for not notifying you from my end.
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: No worries
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: WOW lovely
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes anything to release the financial burden
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct!
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow nice
13/12/23, 1:49 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: This is very impressive
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, what did you grasp from it Freda?
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Hard work really does pay
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m really motivated
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely true Freda and as your guide, I will definitely make sure you to assist you in this journey and achieve even higher goals🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

Let me share about myself…
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok great
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I have watched the video
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: 👏
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, what all you learned about me from the video?
13/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It’s explaining but the nice opportunities that come with not learning abroad but also enhancing one’s skills and gaining knowledge while also helping release financial burden
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Freda, I am delighted to hear this from you👏🏼
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
13/12/23, 2:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very interesting
13/12/23, 2:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright looking forward to it
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Freda,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Good Afternoon 
I’m fine thank you
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: How are you?
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we can
14/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
14/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:01 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow

14/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
14/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I liked the quotes a lot especially the one that talks about not limiting oneself. We can achieve as long as we put our mind and heart to something. The sky is indeed the limit
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m inspired truly
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, Freda!

During the next three days, I have an exciting and creative task for you🎭, and you can choose from three options:
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Option A*: Design a captivating poster that visually represents your current position in terms of your goals and illustrates where you aspire to be with the support of Edoofa📈

14/12/23, 2:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Option A
14/12/23, 2:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright monday it is

18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Freda, I am not able to understand the video since the volume is very low. By any chance is it possible to increase the volume😓🥺
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: That would require to record again but I am at a noisy place can I take it a quiet place later on during the day?
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, but you can use applications like InShot to increase the volume of the video
18/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok let me download inshot
