This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled EWYL Group session on Wednesday. I shared the call schedule last week, and I expected your participation. I understand that life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges, and I'd appreciate it if you could kindly share the reason for your absence during the call. Your input is valuable to us, and we want to ensure we address any concerns or issues you might have.
16/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 574 3576: Very sorry ma’am this week and last week it was very hectic for me as I was preparing for my upcoming examinations
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Dezyline!
How are you?

I can understand the same. how did the exams go?
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you mentioned your reason for not attending the chat session on Wednesday and finding it genuine, I am now sharing with you the task that was shared and that will _mark your attendance for the month of October_📆
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *DEADLINE FOR THE VIDEO* - 18/10/2023, 5 PM
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also Dezyline, I hope you understand that it comes from a place of concern when I express my feelings about recent developments. Denzel, you're undoubtedly a talented student, and I hold high regard for your abilities. However, in recent weeks, there has been a noticeable shift in our dynamic, and it appears that my efforts and follow-ups have perhaps been taken for granted. I believe we can work together to find a better balance and ensure that your talents continue to shine while fostering a more mutually respectful mentor-student relationship. Your growth and success are essential to me, and I would appreciate your understanding as we navigate this situation together.
20/10/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Dezyline and parents!
How are you?
20/10/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263717550526 Dezyline was given an amazing opportunity a month ago and she was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Dezyline?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

19/12/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
Hope you are enjoying your first winter season in India! 🥶

I've received messages from you and other Edoofians at the University, expressing their focus on exam preparations. Considering your likely Christmas celebrations and festive engagements, the team and I thought it would be best to _relieve you from sessions until the end of December_. We plan to *resume our first session of the new year in the first week of January*. 😌
19/12/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Every week, I will connect with you for quick updates for 5-10 minutes*. Along with this, *you can share concerns with me Monday to Friday from 06:00-08:00 PM IST if needed🫶🏻*. I'll still be accepting student application forms and African school forms. If you _wish to schedule a one-on-one call for project-related doubts during this time, I'm more than happy to accommodate🫱🏻‍🫲🏼._ I hope you won't waste this time and stay focused on projects. I would appreciate it if you dedicate some time and show productivity during that period.

Best wishes, and enjoy the festive season!
