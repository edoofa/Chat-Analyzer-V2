Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

19/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes please
19/12/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Memory, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Maam.So to commence with it has always been my biggest dream to become well reputed Lawyer. Growing up I've seen court trials where the victim is oppressed due to failure to have someone who can stand up for them especially the girl child. This has triggered me to have the desire to want to stand up for people's rights and the girl child at large.Through the EWYL Programme I'll be able to fund for myswlf at the same time learning to achieve my goal. Thereby this will reduce the finanicial burden on my parents.
19/12/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your heartfelt aspirations with us. Your dream of becoming a reputable lawyer and advocating for the rights of the oppressed, especially the girl child, is truly inspiring. Your commitment to achieving this dream through the EWYL Programme is commendable, as it not only empowers you but also eases the financial burden on your parents. Your determination to make a positive impact is admirable.
19/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
19/12/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 401 4355: No Ma'am
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Noted. Thank you
19/12/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 401 4355: This surely is a very great achievement and I look forward to doing the same.
