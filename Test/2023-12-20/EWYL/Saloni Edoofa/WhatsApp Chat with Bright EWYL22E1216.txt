11/12/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
11/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay that was a guide for searching for companies
11/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 978 3076: there are 7 steps we can take for us to search for companies
11/12/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share in-depth what you have understood from it?
11/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 978 3076: Platforms that can be used: Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media, Internshala(or 
any other internship providing sources), Social media pages( Facebook, Instagram, 
Twitter),
1) Techzim: https://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/zimbabwean-startups/
11/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 978 3076: step 1 ...its for searching for companies that suit yr requirements

step 2 ... studying effectively about the company like looking at the nature of the company

step 3 .... studying the website of the company is one of the most important   becoz u be researching on the founders of the company

step 4....checking the various social media platforms of the company
11/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 978 3076: step 5 is understanding background of the founders and other members in the company so as to have an idea of how th company functions
11/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 978 3076: the last step is creating effective communication with the members of the company by sending links and connection request
11/12/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, Bright!
You have explained it with so much clarity and research, gives me a lot of confidence🚀🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
11/12/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
11/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay i understand ma'am
11/12/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is a short summary of the same.
11/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay i get it ma'am..m understanding
11/12/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Bright, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
11/12/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

11/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay ma'am I understand and thank you for helping me
11/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Bright, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Bright!
11/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay maam

12/12/23, 9:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
12/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 978 3076: i learnt that this project encourages students to have a mindset of indentifying opportunities and sharing them openly to others thus creating effective communication too
12/12/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Bright, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
12/12/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

12/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay i will do so
12/12/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 978 3076: okaY ma'am i understand
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Bright/Saloni/12DEC2023*
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
12/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay and that will be great if we have 120 applicants
12/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 978 3076: learning about the great opportunities
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

12/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay its awesome
12/12/23, 9:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

14/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
14/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay ma'am
14/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 978 3076: okay the last project is all about collaborations in my nearby schools thereby creating links in schools for others who may also get interested in Edoofa
14/12/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled about our upcoming session starting on Monday since I will be unavailable tomorrow due to a prior meeting. During the next three days, I have an exciting and creative task for you🎭, and you can choose from three options:
14/12/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Option A*: Design a captivating poster that visually represents your current position in terms of your goals and illustrates where you aspire to be with the support of Edoofa📈

OR

*Option B*: If you've been involved in any community-building projects, create a poster highlighting your experiences and discussing Edoofa's role in these initiatives🎯🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

OR

*Option C*: Produce a video detailing your journey so far, starting from the counseling phase, progressing through the admission process, and concluding with your encounters with me as part of the EWYL Department📽️

I am eager to see your response and the creative output from your chosen option. Looking forward to our session on Monday.
14/12/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will discuss this on Monday
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 978 3076: okay ma'am thank you

19/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why were you absent for your session yesterday?
19/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 978 3076: yesterday I couldn't make it on time because i was supposed to attend another lesson on that time
