How are you?

16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 376 4654: Ok noted
21/09/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Tafara will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/10/23, 7:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tafara can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 8:29 am - +263 78 108 1765: Yes how are you ma'am
14/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 78 108 1765: Yes, we are !
16/10/23, 7:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
16/10/23, 7:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: I apologize for the delay in getting back to you on Saturday. I was caught up in an important meeting that demanded my immediate attention. I hope you understand, and I appreciate your patience.
16/10/23, 7:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
16/10/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I trust you're doing well.

Starting this week, our sessions will be scheduled every Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM✨

Your presence at the upcoming session on 18/10/2023 is highly anticipated.
17/10/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
17/10/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

18/10/23, 9:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, I hope you're doing well today! 

Shall we kick off our sessions? Remember, every step you take today brings you closer to your goals, and every moment is an opportunity for growth. Let's make this session count🌟
25/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning!
How is your day going?

May we begin with our session?
28/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 108 1765: Waiting for this message
28/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 108 1765: Happy Dussehra to you guys !!! Ohh that's interesting...... l didn't know about it before but now l do..... thanks for that..... It's an appreciable practice !
28/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 108 1765: I think it's a great practice. These activities help people to be conscious and decide whether they should really partake in evil deeds. After all, Good over evil should prevail.... so l think it's good always to remind people about this, especially this new 21st generation. It has people who are now doing the worst .....
01/11/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning!

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
