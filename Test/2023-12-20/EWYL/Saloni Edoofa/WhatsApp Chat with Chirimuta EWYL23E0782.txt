19/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 396 5838: 23 November
19/10/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure you don't miss out on any essential guidance.
19/10/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.
19/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you for understanding will fit in whenever he is not available

20/10/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
20/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes that's true glad working with you too
20/10/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
20/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Okay no problem
20/10/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Thank you ma'am
20/10/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you see the video, do let me know.
20/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Done with it already
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know what you grasped about me?
20/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 396 5838: From the little l grasped you gave us a brief summary of who saloni Rastogi is and how you looking forward to working with us and that we have a deep understanding of the program and grow in knowledge and how you will assist us in everything we intend to know
20/10/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
20/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Yes
20/10/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 396 5838: Noo
20/10/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/10/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 563 6867: hello  maam
20/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Bright!
20/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you gone through these objectives?
20/10/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

21/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Chirimuta!
How are you?
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I understand that you are occupied in your exams.
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will commence our sessions starting from Wednesday onward. 😊 Please note that I won't be available on Monday due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥 <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: While Dussehra is a unique and culturally significant Indian festival, it can be related to the spirit of celebration and community found in many festivals around the world, including Zimbabwe. 🎉 Zimbabwe has its own rich tapestry of festivals, such as the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) and traditional celebrations like the Harare Agricultural Show. 🎪🌾 These festivals, like Dussehra, bring people together in a spirit of unity and celebration, fostering a sense of togetherness and cultural pride. 🤝

26/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 563 6867: l hasunderstood that besides getting scholarship credits, ewyl also helps one to gain good 
persuading skills, good communication skills and to keep on trying after rejection. Part 1 is clearly 
stating corporate alliances with companies which have more 25employeesand also which have a 
minimum annual turnover of 1.5 milion dollars.Part 2 is about spreading the edoofa news to 
different schools mainly in my region. l will have to make a list of those schools, then the decision 
makers from those schools wil be reached by the edoofa team. the idea is about bringing more 
people to Edoofa, so that they will also gain the opportunity and become part of the edoofa famiy.l 
have understand and learned a lot.

26/10/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

08/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 563 6867: its okay maam
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 563 6867: I understand it
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 563 6867: we can moveb on maam
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Chirimuta/Saloni/8NOV2023*
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 563 6867: noted maam
09/11/23, 8:10 am - +263 71 563 6867: Good morning 🌞 ma'am, l hope l found you well. Please be note that today l won't be able to make it, l have an exam
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Chirimuta!

I am doing well, thank you.

20/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
