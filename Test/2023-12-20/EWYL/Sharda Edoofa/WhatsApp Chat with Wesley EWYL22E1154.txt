It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 815 6959: Yes l am ready
17/08/23, 3:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 815 6959: Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and go comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.Thats what l know it is. it have it's objectives below
17/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 815 6959: First objective is to support Edoofians in financing their own education through hard work and earning credits to pay tuition fees. It's important to note that scholarship credits are not cash, but they will directly reduce the balance of tuition fees when paid into the university account.
17/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 815 6959: Second objective is to provide equal opportunities for all Edoofians to acquire 21st-century skills, enabling them to enter the job market after completing their degrees. Our curriculum is designed to systematically develop your skill set, preparing you to meet the requirements of employers and achieve your professional goals.
18/08/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday!

29/08/23, 4:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

22/09/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Wesley

I hope you are doing well
I understand your concerns and that is why I have asked your parents to join  one session so that they can join the EWYL Line on your behalf and write an email of On Hold on your behalf.
We will put your program on Hold until your exams will get over and then we will resume from where we left last time
25/09/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon, *wesley*

I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to come for the scheduled so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
26/09/23, 6:51 am - +263 77 973 9349: Mornings how are you l am Blessing father to Wesley may you assist us on Wesley's temporary unavailability whilst he is undertaking his exams.

Since your EWYL program has been put on hold due to your exams.

29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 973 9349: A very good afternoon today for you
29/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How are you doing
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and *Wesley*

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
02/10/23, 5:34 am - +263 77 973 9349: Greetings how are you l hope you are fine l would  to express my happiness   with coming up with flexible sessions for our child we will definitely support this gesture and participate with what we know so that Wesley succeed.  We are comfortable with option 2 doing the sessions in the mid day. Thanks in advance
02/10/23, 5:35 am - +263 77 973 9349: That is Monday Tuesday and Wednesday from 2pm to 3pm until Wesley finishes his studies
03/10/23, 8:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Wesley and parents
I hope you are doing well

05/10/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is agreat food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Wesley* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
05/10/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Wesley*’S EWYL journey:
05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨

2. Ensure *Wesley* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 973 9349: Okay noted thats great and self motivating goals which are achievable but with the world 's technology which is ever developing measures must be put in place so that success is attained

*"Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life." - Steve Jobs*

30/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
30/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
30/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

You are most welcome.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.

Network challenges
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wesley
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 973 9349: Thats  a great motivational quotation action or activities if done properly it speaks louder than voices. Thank you
08/12/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad you think so too. You are welcome please.
08/12/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.
For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.
So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
08/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 973 9349: Thank you thats a good guide in my studies and life too. We can have the sessions now with pleasure

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 973 9349: Q1: The school is St Anthony's High sch. Yes the school is connected with Edoofa, some students are there and there is a platform group for Edoofians.

08/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure.
08/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
08/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 973 9349: Okay mentor if l get you well you mean l am supposed to look for another nearby school not necessarily where l learn and open the links with school authorities and the Edoofa

08/12/23, 3:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

or

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller
This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort. It reminds us that our individual abilities may be limited, but when we unite and work together, our potential becomes boundless. Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.
Let's make this session a testament to the incredible achievements possible when we join forces.

11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
