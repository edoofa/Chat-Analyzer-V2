I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to message on the EWYL Line so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Monday and Thursday, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.

*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.
