After that, l will explain the mission, vision, and the work which is being done by Edoofa to these people.
I will then work in order to arrange meetings between the organization's members and the Edoofa team and then there will be the signing of the contract.
Due to the issue of internet there are more chances of l being able to get in contact with organizations which are technology driven. Getting in contact with these companies as a student on behalf of Edoofa will give me a chance and credibility and can help me land an online project in our country.

The project is divided in small activities which are are as follows;
Activity 1 
As on internet l may search for the companies which provide mobile application or a finTech company.
A company which deals in payment systems and mobile wallet.
A company which have a community driven mobile platforms.

And also education technology companies.

Furthermore, l need to research more about each company so as to come up with the information such as the number of employees and they must be above 30, their yearly revenue and their annual turnover must be 1,5 million and above.

I may achieve the above activity by reaching to people who are close to me who also work in that organization.

Activity 2
For activity 2, there is need for me to identify the decision makers in those organization and reach to them.
I also need to create a LinkedIn account which is the most effective tool to find professionals and the company they are working with.

Activity 3
This is where l will share the the Edoofa's message with my connections.

Activity 4
This is where l will arrange for a meeting or a video call with Edoofa and signing the contract.
Once the professionals that l am trying to reach out agrees to get onto a call with the seniors in team Edoofa then l will need to arrange a call that is suitable to both of them.

Activity 5
This is where there is reporting through the entire activities.
This is where there is creation of a Google sheet to record the progress of our project.

Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Hindu festival celebrated by millions of people around the world. It usually lasts five days and marks the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The word "Diwali" itself comes from the Sanskrit words "deepa," meaning light or lamp, and "avali," meaning row.

Here are some key aspects of Diwali:

    Symbolism of Light: The lighting of lamps, candles, and fireworks symbolizes the triumph of light (knowledge and goodness) over darkness (ignorance and evil).

    Religious Significance: Diwali has different religious significance for various communities. Hindus celebrate it to honor Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. Sikhs celebrate it as the day Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Sikh guru, was released from imprisonment. Jains commemorate the spiritual awakening of Lord Mahavira.

    Festive Activities: Homes are cleaned and decorated, and people wear new clothes. Families come together for feasts, exchange gifts, and share sweets. Fireworks and colorful rangoli (decorative art made with colored powders) are common during the celebrations.

    Spiritual Reflection: Diwali is also a time for spiritual reflection and self-improvement. It is believed that on this day, one should strive to eliminate negative qualities within oneself and cultivate positive virtues.

    Cultural Diversity: While Diwali is rooted in Hindu traditions, it is celebrated by people of various faiths and backgrounds. It is a time when people come together to celebrate diversity and strengthen community bonds.

Overall, Diwali is a joyous and spiritually significant festival that embodies the values of light, goodness, and the victory of righteousness.

01/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 152 4484: The last project: The African Schools Education Reform Mission.

I will reach out to local schools in our region and reach to the headmasters and inform then about Edoofa program.

So at first l can make a list of all the higher secondary schools in our local area.
I can start with my own school and l will connect with the principal of my school and l may tell them about why l joined Edoofa in the first placeand also tell them how l have planned my future and then l will share the program with them.
After that l could simply ask them if l would like to set up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director.
After this l can then the contact details of the principal with my EWYL Mentor and the information will  be provided to me.
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 152 4484: Thank you for asking mem, l am doing well.

I am doing good, thank you so much for asking.
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
01/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 152 4484: Yes l agree
01/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 152 4484: Yes l am ready
01/12/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
01/12/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Tinotenda, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
01/12/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

01/12/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes ofcourse.
01/12/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
01/12/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
01/12/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
