26/10/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, John and parents @263776256363 @263772584882 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

That sounds like a fantastic mix of interests! Playing in soccer tournaments must be exciting. Do you have any favorite football clubs or players you admire? And regarding regular concerts, have you been to any big music events before, or are you looking forward to experiencing the music scene in India for the first time? Lastly, for athletics, are there any specific sports you're interested in trying or watching in India?

Due to the changes in the world there is a great possibility of connecting with digital and technological driven countries.i have to identify such companies by starting with my immediate networks sharing objectives of edoofa and creating a lingdin account which allows me to search for such companies and get in touch with there employees
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks John . I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you.

21/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Okay before I start connecting with the companies there are some factors that I should take into consideration which are nature of the company that, financial stability , background of the founder and also the scale of the company. On the guide there are certain steps which I should follow to complete the task easily which are first search for the appropriate companies via Google or LinkedIn, after that I should research more on the companies selected.i should then checkout the website of the company and see if it works properly and then visit the various social media platforms of the company including apps if available, afterwards I should check the background of the founder and core members, if their backgrounds are okay I should then reach out to them by dropping an invitation note and issuing a connection request
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You know what John, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: ow, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you

21/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: MOU stands for "Memorandum of Understanding." Think of it like a special agreement between two people, organizations, or groups. It's not as formal or official as a contract, but it still shows that they agree on certain things and plan to work together on something.
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
21/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!

23/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Okay im now done, community building refers to establishing and strengthening relationship and shared identities among individuals within a particular group. This helps in creating a supportive environment, the goal of the project is to build a supportive, positive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility towards achieving collective success, by reaching out to personal and extended networks I should identify motivated youths who are looking forward to creating great careers and direct them towars Edoofa
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
We left out a few important discussions, so your active participation and timely response is crucial, given the importance of the EWYL session.

*"Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." - Winston S. Churchill*

30/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
01/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 625 6363: 1. Destiny Achievers Group of schools it's not connected
01/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Thank you

01/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 625 6363: 3. Harare
01/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
01/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
01/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 625 6363: Of course
01/12/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
01/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *John, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
01/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
