01/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok ma'am  i understand 

I have a question
01/08/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
01/08/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
01/08/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Best of Luck!
01/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Those who are in their final year how will they be accepted into the Program without A level results?
01/08/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once they will be done with their A level only then they will be able to come to India.
01/08/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 156 4809: My question is how will they get accepted?
01/08/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It will be similar admission process just like what you did.
01/08/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
01/08/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Ok
01/08/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
01/08/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 3:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
01/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am
01/08/23, 3:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We are done for today's session. Let's meet tomorrow.
02/08/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is not connected with Edoofa:
02/08/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.
02/08/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
02/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes ma'am
02/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 156 4809: *Q1*. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
-Nashville High School

*Q2*. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
- I will tell the school heads about the exciting program and the advantages of it which is the EWYL program☺️which are the scholarship credits i will tell them how i became part of it.
-I will surely tell them a lot☺️

*Q3*. Name of the Province where your school is located.
-Midlands Province
02/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *If the School is connected* with Edoofa:
02/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
02/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Yes maam
02/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
02/08/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
02/08/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
02/08/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: are you following Ruvimbo?
02/08/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

08/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
08/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *School Group < 100*
08/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

08/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *How to excel in the project?*

SET 1: 

*Since you are facing challenges connecting with Headmasters, what we can do is:*

1) I can share some contact details with you of those Schools that were earlier not responsive to us with whom you can establish a connection again

2) You can try searching for schools on Google

-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. 
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.

3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.

4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
08/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: SET 2
08/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
08/08/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: ▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success 
  ▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
  ▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.

09/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

09/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 156 4809: The ones i was in the same stream with,are already in University.
09/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 156 4809: The current A levels are afraid of being scammed🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
09/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 156 4809: Some are saying you just to take our money😭

10/08/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement.
10/08/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
10/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people.
10/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day.
10/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
10/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope we are not moving so fast?

*Kindly excuse me for any inconvenience. I'd like to inform you that I encountered a technical glitch due to which last week's activity was shared again with you. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.*

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.
