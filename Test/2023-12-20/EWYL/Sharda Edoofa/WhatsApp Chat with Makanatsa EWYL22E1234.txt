18/08/23, 3:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
18/08/23, 3:46 pm - +91 82649 03942: Understood
18/08/23, 3:48 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
 
https://youtube.com/watch?v=ixWTHWpM9iU&feature=share
18/08/23, 3:49 pm - +91 82649 03942: Alright
18/08/23, 3:51 pm - +91 78273 08969: After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.
18/08/23, 3:51 pm - +91 82649 03942: Okay alright
18/08/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: So Makanatsa now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
18/08/23, 3:56 pm - +91 82649 03942: Yes i will
18/08/23, 3:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you have any questions regarding this?
18/08/23, 3:57 pm - +91 82649 03942: No i don't..i have understood thank you

29/09/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Makanatsa,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
29/09/23, 1:46 pm - +91 82649 03942: Ohhh this is heartbreaking but your health comes first...Hope you feel really better..it was really great having you as my mentor...you may not my mentor for long but i really appreciate the time we had and i enjoyed it.
Wishing you a quick recover. 
All the best

Thank you so much for sharing your confirmation.
10/10/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 82649 03942: Okay noted
11/10/23, 4:37 pm - +91 82649 03942: Okay noted
11/10/23, 4:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the 
Community Building Project.
11/10/23, 4:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  - 

Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - +91 82649 03942: Okay alright i underst
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - +91 82649 03942: Understand
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - +91 82649 03942: Alright
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more.
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Since you are aware that we have our call scheduled on this saturday, please make sure you complete this task by 12:00pm on Friday.*
11/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
11/10/23, 4:43 pm - +91 82649 03942: Alright
11/10/23, 4:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now Makanatsa?
11/10/23, 4:43 pm - +91 82649 03942: Yes
11/10/23, 4:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I'd like to inform you that we will be conducting two webinars each month. It is crucial that you attend these webinars.

09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - +91 82649 03942: Okay ma'am but what is a Diya
14/11/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings Makanatsa
I hope you are doing well

A Diya is a traditional oil lamp used in various cultures, particularly during festivals and religious ceremonies. It is a small clay lamp with a cotton wick, and it is typically filled with ghee or oil. The Diya holds cultural and symbolic significance, representing the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance in many traditions. During festivals like Diwali in Hinduism, Diyas are lit to celebrate the victory of light and the dispelling of darkness. The warm glow of Diyas adds to the festive and spiritual atmosphere, and they are often arranged in decorative patterns or designs.
