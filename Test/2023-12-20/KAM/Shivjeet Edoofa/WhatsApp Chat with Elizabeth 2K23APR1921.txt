03/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
03/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am not very clear
03/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
03/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Alright proceed
03/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
03/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
03/10/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 502 8391: It's now clear thanks for the update
03/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 502 8391: So the $500 -$750 is paid before the study period or
03/10/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, is  a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
03/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
03/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 502 8391: And for the universities say one gets offer letters from mor than one will you help the students to choose the best
03/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly  we are more than happy to do that.
03/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 502 8391: That will be very wonderful
04/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and My dear student..

09/10/23, 4:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Nice
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 502 8391: But I think you are making a mistake it's Elizabeth not Blessing
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: yes, it is indeed Elizabeth Kindly excuse me for the error.
09/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok
09/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are clear so that we can proceed with the session.
09/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 502 8391: It's clear sir
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes very interesting
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Following
09/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Can you provide more information please
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: o pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok noted
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am not understanding
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one so that you have a clear understanding -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes now clear about this one
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok is this in one one would not have achieved the required grades
09/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct too. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok understood
09/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 502 8391: If I may ask, does the $150 come from the EWYL program
09/10/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is the great part. No, it is not and it will be bourne by the Edoofa team. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 502 8391: So $150 is part of the scholarship  scheme
09/10/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is a grant that we are willing to give for the achievements that we have here.
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok got you
09/10/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 502 8391: May I know how long is a semester in India
09/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, 6 months constitutes a semester, and there are typically 2 semesters in a year in the Indian education system. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know we you are clear here?
09/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Now clear on this
09/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Elizabet's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Elizabeth is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am very much interested
09/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Elizabeth's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 502 8391: It ok and very much appreciated
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Elizabeth.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Good afternoon
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Thats wonderful
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth!

I wanted to ensure that you have a better understanding of the offer letter, and to allow for a more detailed discussion of your concerns, I'd like to reschedule our conversation for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT. Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok thank you
15/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 502 8391: Morning
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Elizabeth!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 502 8391: Yes have gone through it and am also available to discuss
15/10/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 502 8391: 1 Per semester tuition fees after scholarship       $900

2.Course dura5      5years or  
10semesters

3  Admission and procedure fees     $300

4  Registration fees $750
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes it's clear
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 502 8391: How safe is the off compass accommodation given the the student will be a foreigner
15/10/23, 9:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope you are clear till here, right?
15/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes am clear
15/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 502 8391: And again will the accommodation fees also subsidised by the scholarship
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that the scholarship being offered is applicable on the tuition fee please. Since the accommodation and other costs are considered as personal expenses of the student, therefore, it is not covered in the scholarship. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Is the EWYL program help on this accommodation issue
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. And we will discuss that as well moving ahead. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes am clear
15/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 502 8391: On the 3 seater rooms does that mean every student is going to pay $ 2000 or they will be sharing the amount
15/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a great question. The $2,000 for the three-seater room is typically not divided among the students sharing the room. It's a fixed fee for the entire academic year. So, each student in the three-seater room would contribute $2,000 for the year. I hope this is clear, right?
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes it's clear
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Is the $750 be part of the  tuition fees .I mean that which will be paid within 15 working days after receiving the offer letter
15/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
15/10/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, once paid the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted to your first year fee please.
15/10/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
15/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 502 8391: And is the $300 still going to be paid
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please the admission fee of $300 has been waived off, and we only have the registation fee that is to be paid now. And, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Don't know if I got you well here   .What are you saying about $150
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know what exactly is it that you wish to ask here @263775028391 ?
15/10/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 502 8391: It looks like it's $600 to be paid and what will happen to the $150
15/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Initially it was $750 and here you are saying complete fee of $600
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, may you please go through all the three messages of mine again.
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok
15/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok got you now clear
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 5:08 am - +263 77 502 8391: I stay in Harare
16/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 502 8391: Good morning
16/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 502 8391: Are there any chances of having acceptance letters from more than one university for comparison
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Elizabeth!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 502 8391: Say one is not comfortable with the university that offered an acceptance letter is there any chances of changing
16/10/23, 11:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
17/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier, may I know if you were able to go through this message of mine by now?
17/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Good afternoon am clear about this and  a will be patient enough to wait
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am not aware
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263775028391 may I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 5:24 am - +263 77 502 8391: Morning
19/10/23, 5:24 am - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
19/10/23, 5:25 am - +263 77 502 8391: Sorry for  last response I was asleep.
19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok it's fine

19/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

07/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, let us assume that we start that payment plan in this month itself, then how much amount would you be able to pay as of now towards the same?

08/11/23, 9:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, earlier you had mentioned that end of this month, you would be paying $300, and then now you have mentioned that you will clear the fee by April 2024, can you please help me in understanding the difference in these two statements please?
08/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am first first instalment of 300 will be paid by end of November then the balance upto end of April or before

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

15/11/23, 6:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Elizabeth!
I hope you've had a wonderful few days and a joyous Diwali celebration filled with light and happiness.

17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, since you were required to pay $300 as the first part of the registration fee, I believe you are now in a position to complete the first part, right?
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes am prepared
17/11/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, I would advise you to make the payment of the first part of the registration fee and then look towards completing the full admission later. I hope you would agree to the same, right?
18/11/23, 3:09 am - +263 77 502 8391: It's ok
22/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 594 6301: How are you

23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Elizabeth!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes am ready
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 594 6301: Yes
23/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier when we were connected with each other here, you had mentioned that you have the $300 ready with yourself for Elizabeth's registration process, right?
23/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Yes
23/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am sure will pay before 30 since I stay out of town
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. However, may I know how are you planning to do that please?

23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, I believe you are certain about doing that, right?
23/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Very certain
23/11/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, in order for us to work with this payment, you would have to write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you are planning to make the payment of $300 by 28th November and clear the first part of the fee and asking that if you plan to do that, would you still be able to secure the scholarship seat along with the Endowment Plan Benefits. I hope this is understood?
23/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Am not clearly getting you .Are you saying the scholarship seat had been cancelled .
23/11/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, the seat has not been cancelled, however, the Endowment Plan Benefits that you had received earlier may not be available anymore since it's been too long since we have crossed the deadline, therefore, the academic board officials will be confirming the same.
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 502 8391: Ok.Are there any chances that they can be restored
23/11/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. For that, you would have to write the mail as I have suggested above. I hope you are clear with that?
