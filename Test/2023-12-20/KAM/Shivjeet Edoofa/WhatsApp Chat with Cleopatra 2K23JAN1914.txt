Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi.

10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
18/10/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263782639124 @263715765954 @263774808904 @263718409724

19/10/23, 7:30 am - +263 71 840 9724: Yes
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as it was not my available hours by the time you reached out.

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 840 9724: I was also not active. Can u please propose the time we should have this session
23/10/23, 6:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Cleopatra!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. Certainly, for further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 480 8904: 3:00 pm is fine
23/10/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Cleopatra!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 480 8904: It was good though very hot
23/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, winter is coming soon. So, shall we proceed with the session?
23/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes with pleasure
23/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
23/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes, l now recall
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 480 8904: The offer letter is a letter indicating that one has managed to get a place reserved and applications are now being done to different universities
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
25/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Let's meet at 7:30 pm if you are comfortable with that
25/10/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall work on that no worries.
25/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Evening
25/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: How are you doing this lovely evening?
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Am good and you
25/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
25/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
25/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 480 8904: There's no electricity for now so my battery can die any time
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand I am sharing the benefits now. 


*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
25/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 480 8904: I have reviewed the benefits
25/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 480 8904: This is good
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Very much.
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes. This is such a good thing on the part of the student
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 480 8904: No. Am following
25/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Please provide me with the information
25/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 480 8904: I have just lost my internet connection
25/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 480 8904: It's back
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
25/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 480 8904: I totally agree
25/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Very clear
25/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes. Following
25/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes explain further
25/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Cleopatra's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Cleopatra is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
25/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Very much
25/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Cleopatra application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

21/11/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 840 9724: Thank you. There was no electricity. My apologies
22/11/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 840 9724: This is very good and a welcome move
22/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
23/11/23, 2:14 am - +263 77 480 8904 left

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. Absolutely, I understand power outages can cause disruptions. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session and let us conclude the offer letter today. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
23/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Outside Harare but occasionally l visit Harare
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Thank you
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes. I had lost connection
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Thank you so much
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we have established your total annual education cost, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes following
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 480 8904: This is good
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which would be $3450. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3450 - $1000 = $2450, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
23/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
23/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 480 8904: So far no quiry but I come across any area that needs clarification I will always ask
23/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, and as always, and as your admission officer, I am ready and happy always to guide you through this. Now, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you  -
23/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
23/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

23/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
23/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
23/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
23/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes. Have a great day and weekend
23/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You too, dear.
28/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Cleopatra!

I hope you are doing well and feeling blessed. I wanted to let you know that I was not able to reach you yesterday and have a meaningful conversion as there were technical difficulties on our end. Hence, I would like to reach out to inquire about that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 480 8904: We are so excited about this
28/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

As the university has set a deadline of November 30, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $275, or you can opt to pay the full $550 in one installment to expedite your admission process.
