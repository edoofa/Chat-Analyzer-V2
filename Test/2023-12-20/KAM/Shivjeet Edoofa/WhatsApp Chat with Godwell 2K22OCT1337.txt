17/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes I am ready
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
17/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
17/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 082 5059: I have reviewed  them
17/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 082 5059: So when will the interviews commence?
17/10/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There will be no interview for your university admission process as you are enrolled under the Edoofa program. May I know if you are clear here?
17/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 082 5059: I'm now clear
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
17/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 350 4329: It's clear
17/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Provide more information please
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 082 5059: I can see
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 350 4329: I hope to pass and take bachelor's degree straight away.
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes that is what I Like the most. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 350 4329: That's very clear
17/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes. Very clear.
17/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Noted
17/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 350 4329: No. You clarified it
17/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Godwell's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Godwell is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Definitely yes
17/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Godwell's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Thank you. We really like that
17/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
17/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Thank you. Stay blessed
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Godwell.
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
02/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 08:00 PM to 10:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
02/11/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Still going through the letter will get back to you at 8pm
03/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update, and I appreciate your commitment to reviewing the offer letter. Please take your time to go through it thoroughly, and feel free to reach out when you're ready to discuss it or if you have any questions. I'll be here to assist you at 8 pm. Have a productive time reading through the details, and we'll connect.
03/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Thank you very much for offering Goldwell a place. That's very good news to us. We are in Zimbabwe which bank can we use?
03/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. I have noted them down as a reminder and will address them thoroughly throughout our session. Shall we proceed with the same?
03/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
03/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Let's proceed
03/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 350 4329: 1. The fee after scholarship is $1225
2. Hostel fee    $1200
3.The registeration fee will be deducted from the tuition (1225-750)
03/11/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $875.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
03/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Ok
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Firstly, if  I fail to attain the results requires what will happen to my place and the money that would've been paid?
03/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Will Edoofa keep on sending applicants to other universities or we will be just relying on this one only?
03/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 082 5059: On the offer letter there was a fee on uniforms,  that means we would be required to were uniforms?
03/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Then lastly is the $750  related to the 200 that was paid last year?
03/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 082 5059: ..
03/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. I have noted them down as a reminder and will address them thoroughly throughout our session. So, if you don't mind, shall we move on with the session and attend to your concerns accordingly, so that you will have a clear understanding of this offer letter and will be able to understand the replies to queries even more effectively?
03/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, the Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
03/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Thank you. Let's proceed
03/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, you are most welcome. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
03/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you
03/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
03/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Yes
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Noted
03/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we have established your tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2075. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2075 - $1000 = $1075, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Yes
03/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in offer letter.
03/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837.5 and $837.5, with a six-month gap between them.
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Yes
03/11/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Thank you I look forward to the EWYL program
03/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 082 5059: We are together
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 082 5059: I stay in Chimanimani which is a few kilometres  from Mutare
03/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 082 5059: That means 7% charge fee?
03/11/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that's correct. The 7% fee is the charge for using this specific payment method through Mr. Rajan.  It is often more cost-effective compared to other international payment methods. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Noted thank you
03/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Can we I have Mr Rajan details
03/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 082 5059: So we could contact him
03/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Surely I will provide you with the same. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.

04/11/23, 11:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad you found the information about the university interesting. The number of people in each room can vary, and it typically starts with a 3-seater room. However, there are different room configurations available, and you may have the option to choose from 3-seater rooms or even different configurations like 4-seater rooms. The choice of room may also depend on availability and your preferences.
04/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Noted
04/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing Godwell's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
04/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as Godwell has received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing him one step closer to realizing his dream of pursuing education abroad. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 8:00 PM.

04/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are still connected with us and available for this session so that we can proceed with the session and hopefully complete our discussion in due time. @263780825059
04/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Ok
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Godwell!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 350 4329: We are doing very well and we happy and ready to proceed with the session.
06/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that too. I was going through your questions, and I wanted to answer your question here now.
06/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?"
06/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 350 4329: It's clear. We will currently pay the $750 to ensure that the place is secured.
06/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 082 5059: My question is let's say another university  accepts me which has a better ranking compared to Gulzar Group of institutes, will there be a refund or we would pay  again?
06/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is a great question, and as it has been mentioned here, you will not be required to pay the registration fees again. It can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian.
06/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 350 4329: Great news.
06/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Thank you  answered now
06/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, and I am happy that I answered your query regarding his concern. Now, regarding your first question that you asked about in the case of unsuccessful results, may I know if you happen to recall the last three benefits that we have discussed before on our admission process session?
06/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 082 5059: We discussed on reapplication after  taking another year to rewrite A level!
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that is correct along with 

*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*

May I know if you still remember these too?
06/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 082 5059: I have recalled
06/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Answered now
06/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now coming to your part in your uniform concern. Yes, please, in some universities here in India there is a specific code that is followed. The dress code is created to instill a sense of solidarity in the students, furthermore, students are asked to wear formal attire so that they can learn to carry themselves well when they start their professional careers in the near future. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 082 5059: We are clear
06/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now coming to your last question. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you remember this as well, please?
06/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Noted
06/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now,  I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further.

I will be concluding our session for now. So, let us connect on Wednesday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 082 5059: Same and thanks
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Godwell,
