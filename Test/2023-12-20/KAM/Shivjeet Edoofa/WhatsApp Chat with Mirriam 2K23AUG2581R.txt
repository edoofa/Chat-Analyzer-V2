If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/09/23, 9:01 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we can start.
04/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:38 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted
04/09/23, 9:52 pm - +260 97 6037191: Iam done with the university admission process.
04/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/09/23, 10:36 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes they are clear.
04/09/23, 10:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/09/23, 10:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/09/23, 10:50 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes Iam following.
05/09/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Mirriam.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 96 6648524: Good afternoon sir will be available in the evening.
05/09/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Certainly, we shall connect at the evening.
05/09/23, 9:00 pm - +260 96 6648524: Good evening  sir
05/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/09/23, 9:19 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening sir.
We are ready.
05/09/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/09/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/09/23, 9:27 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted sir.
05/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
05/09/23, 10:00 pm - +260 97 6037191: Clarification: kindly help me understand. 
Step 5. Registration fee of $500-- $750 to reserve a seat.Mean while in the Acceptance letter for EDOOFA program page 2 under Program Fee Due paragraph 3 it says Upon securing the scholarship letter of intent registration/admission fee of $500-- $1000 will be charged.However, this fee will be adjusted in the first year upon arrival in. India,, effectively making the processing fee $0. How does it become  $0?

Thanks.
05/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Kindly excuse me for the error on the numbers it would be indeed $500 - $1000. And it constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
05/09/23, 10:07 pm - +260 97 6037191: Fine , we are now on the same page.Thanks for that.
05/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/09/23, 10:11 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes please.
05/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/09/23, 10:16 pm - +260 97 6037191: Kindly proceed.
05/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.

06/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
06/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we did.
06/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
06/09/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 6037191: video 1 takes following instructions and being open minded, two important qualities of successful edoofians.this include secured maximum scholarships and descholarship and above all life transforming careers.
Vedio 2 talkes about offering of scholarships and sharing the visions edoofa at a core level in Addition to that it shares trait that distinguishs a successful student from the lest of cloud.
In video 3 the founders talk about. Schools, colleges and universities.founders talk about discovering this schools and expenses that students are having in these schools.
in the fourth video identifing schools under Edoofa program.
It also talkes about the statement of purpose as the most important step. towards securing a good scholarship is to write s statement of purpose.
06/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/09/23, 4:07 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we are.
06/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended.
06/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
06/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

07/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Mirriam may face some difficulties in attending school activities. I kindly request both you and Mirriam to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
07/09/23, 9:56 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes please.
07/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So, regarding the above task let us put it aside for now. Is that alright?
07/09/23, 10:08 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted sir.
07/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?

08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we are..
08/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 8:41 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening sir. we are ready.sorry for late response.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/09/23, 9:16 pm - +260 97 6037191: Absolutely we agree with you.
08/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/09/23, 9:32 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted.
08/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/09/23, 9:38 pm - +260 97 6037191: Correct sir.
08/09/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes sir.
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
08/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
08/09/23, 10:01 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes indeed.
08/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350  as per the above example.
08/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
08/09/23, 10:19 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted sir.
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mirriam.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you on time.

Please let me know if you are available so we can proceed further with our session?
11/09/23, 8:54 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening sir. Sorry for getting back to you late However, we are happy to hear from you. Please proceed.
11/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. However, it is late and I was not able to get in touch with you. We shall surely proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon. Have a great day ahead.
11/09/23, 10:27 pm - +260 97 6037191: Thanks and good night.
12/09/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mirriam. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. How are you doing today?
12/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 6037191: We are fine thank you.
12/09/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 2:30 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes please.
12/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted however, may l know if the registration fee will be paid soon after Mirriam has done her statement of purpose and has started her EWYL because she will be back first week of December 2023.
12/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. The registration fee can be paid before the commencement of your EWYL process and the Statement of purpose. And since Mirriam is not available for the same.
12/09/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted.
12/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are clear shall we proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes sir.
12/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in December 2023. Considering the reasons you've provided and the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in December as agreed upon.
12/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
12/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
12/09/23, 3:55 pm - +260 97 6037191: Duly noted.
13/09/23, 9:44 am - +260 97 6037191: Good morning sir.
We are not available  this afternoon at 1:00 pm due to bereavement but available this evening. Sorry for the inconvenience.
13/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mirriam. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Certainly we shall connect this evening.
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 6037191: Nited and thanks.
13/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mirriam. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 8:44 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening too.
Hope you are fine.
13/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking. I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - +260 97 6037191: Not yet.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes it is.
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 9:16 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes sir.
13/09/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - +260 97 6037191: Not at all.
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 9:45 pm - +260 97 6037191: We are done with the benefits.
13/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now before we proceed with the session, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. Grade 12 Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (Grade 12).*

*2. Grade 9  Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
13/09/23, 10:15 pm - +260 97 6037191: Grade 12 Results, only end of term 2 results can be availed as she is writing her grade 12 final exams by end of November 2023.

2. Grade 9 results can only be found tomorrow as we have to look for them. 

3. She is yet to collect her National ID.it will be ready end of October 2023.However, we can send the Birth card.

In short allow us to look for some of these documents tomorrow please.
13/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall wait for the same. For the supplement of grade 12. May I know if you might be able to fetch a letter of recommendation from your school, along with the subjects that you will be taking, mentioned in the letter?
13/09/23, 10:22 pm - +260 97 6037191: We shall call the school for the same documents tomorrow.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 4:33 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good afternoon Mr. Shivjeet.we are good this afternoon and our apologies for responding late. We hope you are well too.
21/09/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. I was going through the letter of recommendation, and I have noticed that the subjects are not listed as I mentioned earlier, dear.
21/09/23, 4:57 pm - +260 97 6037191: We did mention to them but may be because of term 2 results which covers all the subjects they thought that would do. However, I can  still request them to send one. Sorry for that.
21/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, yes please kindly do the needful.
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - +260 97 6037191: Duly noted.
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

25/09/23, 6:48 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening sir.
Just arrived from the bush network connection issues.
Sorry for the late response, we are fine .
26/09/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
26/09/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good afternoon sir. We are available.
26/09/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 6037191: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 6037191: Letter of recommendation for Mirriam Mabo Chilondela with the list of subjects.
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to see that. May I know if you have the grade 9 results?
26/09/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we do have. A copy of the same was sent to Mr. Shivjeet.
26/09/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 6037191: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 6037191: Grade. 9 results.
26/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you do much. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
26/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your Grade 12 results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
26/09/23, 3:32 pm - +260 96 6648524: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - +260 97 6037191: Duly noted.
26/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes. It does.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes.
26/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 5:07 pm - +260 97 6037191: At the moment no may be later on as we progress.
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 6037191: Kindly provide more information.
26/09/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
26/09/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
26/09/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
26/09/23, 5:45 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted, but is the early decision benefits duration in Zambia like in West Africa where you pay before January 2023.
26/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pease do not worry about that we well come to the dates and the payment as well in details soon.
26/09/23, 5:57 pm - +260 97 6037191: Duly noted.
26/09/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 6:13 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes.
26/09/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 6:20 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes.
26/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - +260 97 6037191: Clear indeed.
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 6:37 pm - +260 97 6037191: Thank you so much, have a lovely night.🙏 Namaste.
27/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are ready for the session?
27/09/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good afternoon.
Kindly proceed.
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - +260 97 6037191: We are clear as parents .
27/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 5:19 pm - +260 97 6037191: Great and thanks.
27/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
27/09/23, 5:33 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes the 7 points are clear.
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $1000 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $1200 to $1800. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?* <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 6:12 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we do recall.
27/09/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
27/09/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
27/09/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
27/09/23, 6:34 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we are.
27/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
27/09/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you on Tuesday at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 7:55 pm - +260 97 6037191: Thanks , have a blessed night.
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good afternoon.
Kindly proceed.
03/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 5th of October and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 6037191: Very  clear.
03/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
03/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
03/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 5th of October, the deadline becomes the 20th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 5th of October, and so the first deadline becomes the 14th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 20th of October, 2023).
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 6037191: Second part is it not supposed to be 30/11/ 2023?
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 6037191: Sorry 20/11/2023
03/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the clerical error. Allow me to share the corrected version. 

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 5th of October, and so the first deadline becomes the 20th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 20th of November, 2023).
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +260 97 6037191: Duly noted
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
03/10/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes the procedures are very clear. However, can one suggest or propose  dates of payments as long as they are  say end of November first part  and end of December 2023 second part?
03/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges with the mentioned dates?
03/10/23, 5:47 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes our budget cannot allow us within October as we had a bereavement recently. Your assistance for this period only will be highly appreciated.
16/10/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon!

I hope you have a restful weekend with your family. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session and discuss all the concerns that you might have.
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good afternoon Mr.Shivjeet.
Iam very sorry that l was not active. However, Iam now though I will be available this evening if you don't mind. Hope you are well.
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, please let me know when you are available for the session.
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 6037191: 20:00 hrs.
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please do inform me once at the time for the session.
17/10/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted sir.
17/10/23, 8:06 pm - +260 97 6037191: Good evening sir.
We are ready for the session if you are available.
17/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, I am. Let us proceed with the session.
17/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - +260 97 6037191: The admission process begins when you receive a letter of admission..There are two ways, The early registration and the standard one. In the early registration one is offered Early Decision Grant of $150, benefit number 3. In this case if your registration fee $750 you pay only $600 in two installments of $300  15 days after receiving letter of admission and the other $300 30 days after the first dead line. The standard one you pay the complete $750 within 15 days of the registration.

The registration fee is $500 to $750.

Thanks.
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - +260 97 6037191: Having challenges with network.
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until the parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with the admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - +260 97 6037191: Very clear.
17/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *5th November* and *5th December*.
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (  *5th November* and *5th December*. .), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Mirriam's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
17/10/23, 9:57 pm - +260 97 6037191: We are comfortable with the early decision benefits and please go ahead with the process.
17/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Mirriam's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Mirriam's higher education well.
17/10/23, 10:55 pm - +260 97 6037191: If we shall have any, we will definitely forward them. Sorry for late response.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

03/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.
03/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
03/11/23, 8:48 pm - +260 97 6037191: Indeed and thanks alot.
03/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
03/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means your total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
03/11/23, 8:56 pm - +260 97 6037191: Exactly,it does.
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that @260976037191. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
03/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 9:12 pm - +260 97 6037191: At the moment no but later as we continue our discussion.
03/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that @260976037191. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
03/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 9:22 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes it is.
03/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by the parents/guardians. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 9:27 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes it does.
03/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
03/11/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
03/11/23, 9:32 pm - +260 97 6037191: Noted.
03/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we are.
03/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 16th, 2023*.
03/11/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Early Decision Benefit, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 9:43 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes please.
03/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 9:51 pm - +260 97 6037191: Yes we are.
03/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 10:04 pm - +260 97 6037191: Sorry we are in Republic of ZAMBIA. We stay in Ndola town.
03/11/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I will be providing you with the most convenient way of payment mode tomorrow. Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
03/11/23, 10:14 pm - +260 97 6037191: Pleasure is ours good morning in India.
04/11/23, 10:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the plane ticket, yes, we will recommend it if you need our help, and we will provide you with one of our trusted travel agents for the same. May I know if we are on the same page here so that I can continue further in our session?
04/11/23, 10:29 am - +260 97 6037191: Kindly proceed.
04/11/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, I am sharing you with a few ingights for the university as well
