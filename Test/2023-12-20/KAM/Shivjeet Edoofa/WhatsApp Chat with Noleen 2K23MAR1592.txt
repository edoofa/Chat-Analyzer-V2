07/09/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/09/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Noleen. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:40 pm - +27 84 803 4442: We are good hope you well too.
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes I am. Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 11:16 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes l still remember the process.. sorry to respond later l got tied up with something at work
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Noleen. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
16/09/23, 8:41 am - +27 84 803 4442: Good morning team ....😆 My my mind is a bit rusty now... please remind me ... sorry for late response Friday a very busy days for me..
18/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/09/23, 5:28 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Clear
18/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/09/23, 5:31 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Clear
18/09/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/09/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 5:34 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Clear
18/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/09/23, 5:36 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Clear
18/09/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - +27 84 803 4442: All clear
18/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/09/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to what that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Noleen's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Noleen is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
18/09/23, 6:21 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes I do
18/09/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Noleen's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/09/23, 6:23 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Cool
18/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
18/09/23, 6:43 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Thank you have a great day tooo
18/09/23, 10:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings As I was going though your Documents I noticed that Noleen's O level is not there. May I know by when you might be able to share it with me?
19/09/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Noleen. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you have the O-level results with you?
19/09/23, 7:15 pm - +27 84 803 4442: I spoke to the head today she promised to look into it tomorrow.
19/09/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall connect tomorrow for further process of our session.
19/09/23, 7:22 pm - +27 84 803 4442: That's ok
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?

20/09/23, 2:53 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes am ready
20/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to fetch the O level results?
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - +27 84 803 4442: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document with me. I shall share the documents with the university officials now. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Thank you have a good day too
02/10/23, 5:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Noleen!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

02/10/23, 5:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Noleen!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
05/10/23, 7:14 am - +27 84 803 4442: Good morning team...l have gone through the documents..very excited to hear this .now my question is
(1)on accomodation how am l supposed to pay and when is it due?
(2)the 750 USD when is it to be paid?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Noleen!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries with me here. Now, about that, stay assured that we will discuss it during our conversation ahead, now, may I know if we can start with that now?
05/10/23, 3:59 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes we can start
05/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! May I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
05/10/23, 5:12 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes I did
05/10/23, 5:13 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Just need clarity on this
06/10/23, 3:27 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Yes clear
06/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
06/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
06/10/23, 3:30 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Clear
06/10/23, 3:47 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Are you here?
06/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - +27 84 803 4442: We clear
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
06/10/23, 4:01 pm - +27 84 803 4442: We clear
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
06/10/23, 4:05 pm - +27 84 803 4442: All clear again
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 16th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 16th November 2023.*
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *16th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +27 84 803 4442: So instead of 750 the amount that we can pay is 600?
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +27 84 803 4442: If so then we are clear
06/10/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Moving ahead, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/10/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
06/10/23, 4:11 pm - +27 84 803 4442: At the moment am in South Africa but my wife is in Bulawayo Zimbabwe
06/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
06/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
06/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
06/10/23, 4:24 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Harare is 500 kms away from Bulawayo
06/10/23, 4:25 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Can there be a place in Johannesburg
06/10/23, 5:40 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Still waiting for your response....am ready to pay
06/10/23, 6:21 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Are we not allowed to make direct payments from South Africa
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Noleen!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
07/10/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, since you are ready to make the payment from South Africa, in that case, would you be comfortable in making the payment through Mama Money?
07/10/23, 11:31 am - +27 84 803 4442: Is it direct to you?
07/10/23, 11:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. On that note, shall I get the Mama Money Order generated for you pleas?
07/10/23, 11:35 am - +27 84 803 4442: Let me deposit the money once on Tuesday morning....
07/10/23, 11:36 am - +27 84 803 4442: But l was wondering why the big institute like yours doesn't have international banking services so that I can make an EFT once
07/10/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please that is a very genuine question please. Now, the reason why we do not advise our students to make the payments through international bank transfer is due to the fact that the transfer charges while using that mode are very high and it is therefore not feasible for the parents. I hope you understand, right?

I hope you are doing well today.
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, thank you for letting me know of that.
21/11/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Noleen!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:14 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Noleen!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. It is me Mr. Shivjeet your admission officer. It has been a while, and it is nice to connect with you again. I was going through the conversation that you had with Mr. Milan. 

I noticed that the deadline for the second part of your university registration fee was on *November 16th*, and it appears that you missed this deadline. I wanted to inquire if you encountered any challenges, and since you missed the deadline, could you please provide an update on your current arrangement for the remaining amount to be paid? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Noleen,

I trust this message finds you well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you were supposed to make a payment of $300 towards your balance registration fee before November 16th. However, it has been over ten days, and we have not received any update from your end. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are approaching the closure of the current rounds of scholarship applications on November 30th, it is important that we share an update with the university before the same deadline. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected.

I also noticed that you were able to review my previous messages, but unfortunately, you did not respond. This leads me to believe that you may be facing challenges preventing you from connecting with us. Am I correct in my understanding?
28/11/23, 1:48 pm - +27 84 803 4442: Good day team..we are very sorry not to respond...l just lost my job last month..l was hoping to get one soon but no lucky till now..So am not sure if we gonna make it or not to pay up the balance...lf it happens that we miss the deadline what's going to happen to us?
28/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear about the job loss it's undoubtedly a challenging time. Regarding the deadline and the impact on your scholarship offer, missing the payment deadline might affect the status of your scholarship. However, as your admission offer, I am here to help you out in the same. 

Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming date of 30th November. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
