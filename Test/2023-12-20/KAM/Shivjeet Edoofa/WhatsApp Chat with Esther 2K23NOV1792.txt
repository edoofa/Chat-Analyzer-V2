29/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
29/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Esther 2K23NOV1792)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
29/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay and the other one?
29/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Esther EWYL23E0963)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
29/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay I understand
29/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
29/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 139 9636: I was impressed by the counseling aspect of the program b because without it I would have gone for a course which won't hold any value in future and also the Earn while you learn program as it reduces the burden on parents by reducing the amount of money they pay
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights regarding the counseling aspect and the Earn While You Learn program offered by Edoofa. It's wonderful to hear how valuable the counseling sessions have been in guiding your educational choices. Making informed decisions about your academic path is crucial, and it's commendable that Edoofa's counseling sessions helped you steer clear of pursuing a course that might not hold long-term value for your future endeavors.

05/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
06/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes they are clear
06/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Good afternoon

And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual.
