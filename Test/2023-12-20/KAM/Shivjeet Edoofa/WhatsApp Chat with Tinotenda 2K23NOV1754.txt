15/12/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
15/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 416 6927: Firstly it is the percentage of the scholarship that impressed me because it will help my parents with covering some of the fees which is a relief as the whole amount that a university without a scholarship requires is a lot so l liked that it cuts down the fees and the EWYL program offered which will help me with an insight on the course l want to do through the projects that I will be doing
