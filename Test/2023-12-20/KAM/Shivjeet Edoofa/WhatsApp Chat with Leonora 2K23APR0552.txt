To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
04/10/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes yes l remember the 6  stages
04/10/23, 4:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
04/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Briefly l can say the fourth stage is where you will be offered  in the chosen university
04/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
04/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay noted

The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
05/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
05/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes lm ready
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
05/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes lm through
05/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
05/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes its clear
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes understood
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes its clear
05/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes what about the name of the selected university?
05/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be provided with a series of offer letter and from that you will be required to choose the same.
05/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay noted
05/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes l would like to know how  it will be assesed for the offer letter
05/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
05/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yaa its clear now
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay noted
05/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

To accommodate our conversation, I propose we meet at 3:00 PM on Monday. I hope this timing works well for you.

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay thank you we will meet on  monday same time
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Afternoon how are you?
09/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes l am avaailable now
09/10/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking.  
With regards to our previous conversation, may I know if you are clear and currently on the same page to further proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes lm clear we can proceed
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes its clear
09/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Ok noted
09/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes how much for . Leonora  admission for her to start next year 2024
09/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be provided to you in the offer letter, sharing details from the universities. You will be well-informed about the deadlines of the fees in advance so that you have ample time to prepare your finances. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes we are on the same page
09/10/23, 4:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

Leonora's  guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Leonora is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes lm looking forward to the next steps and receiving  this offer letter
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Leonora's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

For now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 272 9911: 1  -lts $900 usd after scholarship                           2-lts 5 years duration           3-  lts $300  one time payable

16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 272 9911: I have some questions
16/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what are those?
16/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Noted
16/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Am l not suppose to choose for myself the universities
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that we will discuss the same moving ahead during our conversation. For now, may I know if you are clear till here?
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes lm clear
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leonora!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 272 9911: We are together . Greetings  everyone

18/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Afternoon. How are you?

18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. On that note, I would like to mention that LPU is indeed one of the topmost universities here in India and for a good news, LPU is one of the partnered universities of Edoofa as well. 

Now, we have shared your application with LPU as well, and once we will receive a response from their side, we will let you know.
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, are you aware of how the admission process of a student is carried out?
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 272 9911: No l am not aware of the process
18/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Srry for replying  late
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leonora!

19/10/23, 11:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
