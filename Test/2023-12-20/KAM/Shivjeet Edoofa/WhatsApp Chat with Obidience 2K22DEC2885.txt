05/09/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we would be able to work on that as well, dear. <This message was edited>

05/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i recall it
Thank you
05/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
05/09/23, 8:02 pm - +263 73 721 8664: The fourth stage this os were Edoofa write a recommendation , my academic  documents and the SOP.....and  then the offer letter will be issued <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
05/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 73 721 8664: No
05/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Obidience, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
05/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
05/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Its a good thang  because  it lessens the burdens on my parents
05/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
05/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes
05/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
05/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 73 721 8664: No i wasn't
05/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
05/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
05/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
05/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 73 721 8664: This is good news
05/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
05/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
05/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Okay
05/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 73 721 8664: This is actually  an added advantage
05/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed, dear.
05/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes it does
05/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Its actually getting more interesting
05/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes it does
05/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 73 721 8664: No i don't  have i understand
05/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 73 721 8664: I am aware u mentioned it before
05/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you again with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
05/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
05/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
05/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i now have a better insight <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes
05/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
05/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i do
06/09/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Obidienc.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday.

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
06/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i am available
06/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, your will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and the scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i am clear
06/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2023, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2024, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2023 itself.
06/09/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 73 721 8664: I am very clear with it.
06/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 73 721 8664: There is plenty of options
06/09/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed. Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
06/09/23, 5:52 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes they are clear lets proceed
06/09/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. So I would like to schedule our session for tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further continuation of our session. Have a great day ahead.
06/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Thank you same applies  to you
07/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Obidience,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

07/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
07/09/23, 10:58 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes they are crystal clear
09/09/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today? <This message was edited>

09/09/23, 9:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Obidience, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon The previous day.
09/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i was able to engage into the advantages
09/09/23, 9:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
09/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 73 721 8664: It was so productive because i get to have many options to select from. My parents are also thrilled as i am
09/09/23, 10:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
09/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 73 721 8664: No we don't have
09/09/23, 10:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, dear. May I know if your parents are connected with us for this session?
09/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 73 721 8664: Yes she is connected
09/09/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. How are you doing today Mrs. Felia
09/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 161 5809: I am fine and you
09/09/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking.  I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
09/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 161 5809: Okay you can go ahead
09/09/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.  After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
09/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes we are on the same page
09/09/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
09/09/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
09/09/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 161 5809: So are they Chances that if my child get the offer letter two or  after 5 days as you say 
That's when the registration is wanted?
09/09/23, 10:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. After the arrival of the offer letter, the first half of the registration fee mentioned in the offer letter will be required to be paid in the next 15 days, and the second half in the next 30 days. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes we are in the same page but I don't think by that time I will financially stable because I am still covering on Obidience's tuition fee and exams fee . But I am sure that end of October I will financially stable <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 10:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the challenges. I understand the same. However, in order for us to make a clear plan and guide you with the payment, I would like to complete this discussion first and proceed with the solution. So, shall we proceed further, Mrs. Felia?
09/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes
09/09/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
09/09/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes we can start the discussion
09/09/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 14th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 29th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 73 721 8664: Yes we are
09/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes
09/09/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
09/09/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
09/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 161 5809: Okay
09/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 161 5809: I understand
09/09/23, 11:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 14th of September, the deadline becomes the 29th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 014th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 29th of September 2023, making the second deadline be the 29th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well? <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes we are
09/09/23, 11:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
09/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes they are clear
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
09/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 73 721 8664: On  *Proceed as per the standard procedures*
The registration fee will be $750  after i get the offer letter from the University  i will be give5 a period of 15 days to make the payment of my complete registration fee of $750
09/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 73 721 8664: And on *Proceed with the early decision benefits*
This one comes in two parts the first part  i pay $300 wich is to be paid within 15 days and the Second part is to pay the remaining $300  making  the total of $600  since the burdens has been lifted by the Edoofa  Academic Board  by paying  $150 . It must be paid within  a period of 30 days from deadline <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
09/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 161 5809: Yes I am clear
09/09/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
09/09/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Tuesday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *29th September* and *29th October*.
09/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 73 721 8664: Okay i understand
09/09/23, 11:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines *29th September and 29th October*, you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Obidience’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
09/09/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 161 5809: I don't think right now I can give you the go ahead
09/09/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as an unforseen work that just came up.

It will be a dream come true to learn there because  of its many advantages

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Fine and you
Yes you are we are filled with happiness  and joy
03/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i did
03/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and I share in your happiness and joy about the offer letter. It's a significant achievement for you and your family. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i am looking  forward  to this approach
03/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, Obidience. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 73 721 8664: 1. 900 usd
2. 3 years
3..300 USD
4... 750 USD
03/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Obidience, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
03/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes it does
03/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that, Obidience. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i understand 
And i want to be an off-campus accommodation
03/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your response, Obidience. Opting for off-campus accommodation is a choice that can help you save on accommodation expenses, and it's great to hear that you've made that decision. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
03/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes it does
03/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
03/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 73 721 8664: I am clear with that
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please Obidience, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes we are together
03/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Obidience. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes 
So  the advantages of the  Endowlment plan is that edoofa helps me to carry the  burden of the registration fee by paying  $150 and i will have to pay $600 to make it $750 
And this  $600 can be paid through  a payment  plan which i pay $300 at first and then other $300  within a month after first payment..
Please correct  me if i am wrong
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really impressed and you are absolutely correct, Obidience. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes we are clear
03/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe?

Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes
03/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mukuru Account Details

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare
Contact Number: 0772460067
National ID Number: 63 1037566X00
03/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Okay thank you
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Okay will do that
03/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Just send it cause you wouldn't  know
03/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
03/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Thank you
03/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right Obidience, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
03/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 73 721 8664: That is a fair price
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
03/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes i did
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 73 721 8664: It is so amazing 
This  is a blessing  to us
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Let's say i am on semster break can i visit home or othet wonderful  places in India
03/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, you are welcome to explore India during your semester break. India is a beautiful country with a rich and diverse cultural heritage.

It's a great opportunity to immerse yourself in Indian culture, try local cuisine, and see some of the world's most iconic landmarks. Just make sure to plan your trip in advance. May I know we are on the same page here?
03/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 73 721 8664: Yes we are on the  same page
