18/09/23, 10:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to further connect with you. Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 5:30 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.

19/09/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Sharon,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!

20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes  sir
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your previous concern.  A B.Sc in Biochemistry focuses on the study of chemical processes in living organisms. However, it doesn't include medicine or surgery training. To become a doctor or surgeon, you need to pursue a specialized medical degree after your undergraduate studies. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes we are the same freqeunce ,l want to become a medical doctor   thus my wish
20/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know the subject combination for Sharon for the A level Examintion?
20/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 795 9768: As I confirm  to ms pearl ,my Councilor   .they have only 3  options
1,.degree for biochem
2.  Degree    for dietary  food and nutrition 
3  ..l can't remember the last
 Sir  help me  l want to specialising with neurosurgeons
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Chemistry. 
biology 
Physics 
Mathematics
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Sir ,I will promise I will get A s   for all subjects
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Indeed Ms. Pearl has given you the only available options if one decides to pursue medical in India they have to undergo an examination called the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok sir .I m willing to conduct  such test.
20/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Unfortunately, based on your subject combination, you do not meet the eligibility criteria for a medical course in India. The required subjects for eligibility are English, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. In combination, there is a lack of English as a subject.
20/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 795 9768: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Sir check,l omit  English
20/09/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to clarify that Communication skills are not Identical to English, dear.
20/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok sir l can do bio chem
20/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 784 6333: So is it possible to do medicine and surgery after completing an undergraduate in biochemistry
20/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 784 6333: I have Ordinary level English language
And in Zimbabwe we only have English literature and communication skill at Alevel
20/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is possible to pursue a career in medicine and surgery after completing an undergraduate degree in biochemistry. Many medical schools accept applicants from diverse academic backgrounds, including biochemistry.
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 784 6333: Okay noted 
Is biochemistry a 3year course
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thus wonderful,sir this is an advice that I'm looking for
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Noted

20/09/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 784 6333: Okay sir thank you

20/09/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are clear, may I know if if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
20/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 795 9768: I'm now clear  sir  ,we can proceed  with our session
20/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes sir I  remember  the past discussions  about  the admission procedure
20/09/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
20/09/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 795 9768: From the start sir, we highlighted  the message from the founder of edoofa,the statement of purpose  and conclusively  the university admission counseling  session.and the period taken by student to complete  the course
20/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 795 9768: And the costing of the fees before  the scholarship  and after  scholarship
20/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Correct sir,we are together
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

20/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
20/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 795 9768: I read and understanding  sir,so lm ready for this
20/09/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 795 9768: We can go ahead sir,l read and understanding   the whole endowment  plans
20/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Noted
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Sir its ok
20/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 795 9768: It's fine sir
20/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Understanding  sir
20/09/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thank  you sir good day
21/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 795 9768: I'm good and you
21/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 795 9768: I'm ready  sir
21/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above message?
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Honestly  sir ,l read and understanding  ,so we can proceed  with the process
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
21/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Very clear sir, hope and trust    I will score the maximum results as l promised.,because l earmarked to became a medical doctor after  biochem  graduate  .as God  my helper
21/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really pleased to hear that.Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Sure sir  ,l keep on promise.l will do it to my level best  sir
21/09/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. However, let us have a clear understanding of the alternative cases. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 795 9768: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes l agree
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Understood sir
21/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/09/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Copied sir
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thank you  sir well explained  .
21/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Everything  sounds good  sir.cant complain sir .carry on sir with the process
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
21/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes sir  lm looking forward  the next steps and recieving  the offer  letter

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
21/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thank you
28/09/23, 9:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sharon!

Congratulations on this prestigious offers and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 9:39 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 795 9768: Thanks very much..here on Zimbabwe  where can I deposit  that amount  to
28/09/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 795 9768: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: We will discuss that moving further during our discussion. For now, May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes  sir need for clarification  about  fees  payment  .where can l deposit  to ,here in Zimbabwe.and is there any option  of choosing the university  or only one tha I suppose  to attend for
28/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I have totally understood what you are trying to say, however, as I have mentioned we will discuss all of this during our discussion further, and for that, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
28/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes sir
28/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 795 9768: 1.1315
2.1250
3.750
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1315 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1315 +$1250 = $2565. I hope you are clear about this?
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 795 9768: It's clear  sir
28/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
28/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1315 + $1000) = $2315. Are you clear with this as well?
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Understanding  sir
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok thus great
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Yes it's clear
28/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2315 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2315 - $1000 = $1315 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok sir
28/09/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
28/09/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1315 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2565 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815 which can be paid in two installments of $907 & $908. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
28/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok you  can proceed.very clear  sir
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 12th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 12th November 2023.*
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *12th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok we are on the same page
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Zimbabwe  bulawayo.
28/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok  I will communicate  with him sir .thank you so much
28/09/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles’s FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 795 9768: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 795 9768: You can send me the acc for confirmation  sir
28/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited

28/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 795 9768: The one that I have  its 5333038014131392 for mr jerera. So which is the correct acc no.
28/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 795 9768: With swift code fbcpzwha
28/09/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that Mr. Charles had recently updated his account details, and here I have given you the updated details please. This means that you would have to make the payment on these details itself. I hope this is clear?
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Ok thanks
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
28/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Nothing so far .thanks
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: PDM University stands for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University and is located in Delhi, India. It is a relative university that got the status of a University after a very successful period as an Institution. 

The University status was allocated by the Government in the year 2016 and before that, it was an Institution. This university is located in the Metropolitan City in India with Access to metro connectivity. The University in a short span of 5 years has climbed many ladders and with its success, the Government has built a Metro station that connected the entire city through Metro Rail.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/

30/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in a meeting that came up. I appreciate your patience here, let us continue with our discussion.
30/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
30/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
30/09/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you understand?
30/09/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 795 9768: Once again sir ,at the moment  I don't have any university on my mind ,sir you are the one on the ground who knows better  than me in terms of the best university   on Biochemistry   pass rates
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand the same. However, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discusson?
03/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Sir i understanding  lets let's proceed
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
05/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thank you so much sir .its clear
05/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
05/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 795 9768: Thanks ,l will pay for pdm university  sir
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.

06/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 795 9768: We can discuss  sir
09/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here, for now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter here?

14/11/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Charmaine!
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As discussed earlier, the deadline for the payment of the second part of your registration fee was set for November 12, 2023. Due to the Diwali Festive Holidays, our team was unavailable and not working for the past week. Unfortunately, we couldn't connect with you during this time to obtain an update on your payment status.

Moving forward, could you please provide an update regarding the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well?
21/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Sharon!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Sharon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. It is me Mr. Shivjeet your admission officer. It has been a while, and it is nice to connect with you again. I was going through the conversation that you had with Mr. Milan. 

I noticed that the deadline for the second part of your university registration fee was on November 12th, and it appears that you missed this deadline. I wanted to inquire if you encountered any challenges, and since you missed the deadline, could you please provide an update on your current arrangement for the remaining amount to be paid?
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon,

I trust this message finds you well. I am Mr. Shivjeet, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you were supposed to make a payment towards your balance registration fee before November 12th. However, it has been over 15 days, and we have not received any update from your end. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are approaching the closure of the current rounds of scholarship applications on November 30th, it is important that we share an update with the university before the same deadline. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected.

I also noticed that you were able to review my previous messages, but unfortunately, you did not respond. This leads me to believe that you may be facing challenges preventing you from connecting with us. Am I correct in my understanding?
