Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/08/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
18/08/23, 4:05 am - +263 78 314 6204: Yes yes they are
21/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now, I noticed that you were able to go through the message before?
22/08/23, 4:43 am - +263 78 314 6204: Good morning Ms Kirti
Sorry yesterday l was not able to connect with you due to some health issues but now lm alright we can continue from where we left
22/08/23, 4:43 am - +263 78 314 6204: Yes l went through all the videos thank you
22/08/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well. That is alright, I am sorry to hear that may I know what happened?
22/08/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 314 6204: It was a micrane headache but now lm feeling a bit okay ..thank you
22/08/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are feeling better now. Since you are feeling better, may I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion?
22/08/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes let's proceed
22/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, since you mentioned that you were able to go through the videos, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
22/08/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 314 6204: I came to understand that through Edoofa there are a lot of job opportunities,, offering of quality education from quality universities and also their vision is not just to get students quality education but also to increase the student's capacity for success thus making them more responsible and independent .One can achieve the best in his or her studies only if she follows instructions from the leaders and also doing the right thing at the right time . They also mentioned about the SOP which should convince the university for a student's admission for quality education.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
22/08/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay okay thank you
22/08/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
22/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay let's proceed
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
22/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 314 6204: On this case, since l  am writing my Alevel this year what am l supposed to do then
22/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783146204 I am aware of that, and that is why you can share the statement of entry for A- level because most of the students have them from now.
22/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
23/08/23, 5:32 am - +263 78 314 6204: I am still working on the statement of purpose lm sorry for not informing you
23/08/23, 6:26 am - +263 78 314 6204: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 6:27 am - +263 78 314 6204: I need your help on these questions
23/08/23, 11:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, however, may I know if you were able to submit the SOP form, as I am unable to go through your response. Please try and fill again. Yes, please ask your concern about the academic interview questions, I will be more than happy to help?
23/08/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Question 2
BPM denotes a discipline involving a combination of designing, automation, execution control, measurement and optimization of a business activity flows in support of enterprise goals, employees and customers .BPM has got 5 main steps and these are *Design, Model,* *Execute, Monitor* and lastly *Optimize* .The stakeholders involved include the management team, process owners, process analysts and also system engineers.

Taking a look at the five steps involved in the Business Process Management
1) Design -this is the first step where the business will have only a few stakeholders and resources.
2)Model-this one aims on providing visual depiction of the process phases.
3) Execute-this is when the new model is put to the test inorder to carry out the new processes.
4) Monitor -this is when data is acquired to examine how your critical activities are moving over time.
5)Optimize-it is based on the insights that are gained during the monitoring phase and remove bottlenecks to make your process more efficient.

Organisations use BPM to establish,manage and optimize business processes and also the lifecycle can be repeated after it has reached the last stage thus it becomes a continuous process.In conclusion  BPM usually includes the following components:
a) Design the business process as it should ideally exist and examine the process as it presently exist to determine what needs to be improved .
b) Consider how the business process runs in various circumstances.
c) Implement solutions for improvement, such as standardisation and process automation
d) Monitor the overall performance
e) Keep optimizing the business process.
23/08/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Question 3
Businesses have played a pivotal role in developing the economy of a country . Taking a close look at my country Zimbabwe l have come up to see the different ways businesses have contributed to the success of a country.

Businesses offer employment to people.Employments is when able bodied find jobs in the industrial sector for example in the mining sector Freda Rebecca which is in Bindura also offers part time employment  during construction so as to cater for everyone in the community.This is beneficial as employment helps to lift people's standards of living thus productivity is increased hence maximizing the firm's profits.
Moreso, businesses also help in infrastructure development for example roads, power lines, schools, houses and all other communication networks .This is ideal as this reduces the country's costs to do that thus attracting investors into the country.
Furthermore, large business pay taxes to the government for example OK in Zimbabwe pays 15 percent  of it's profits to the government.This is ideal as it helps to increase the country's Gross domestic product (GDP)
Moreso, businesses also engage in research and development thus they bring new ideas and technology.For example McAdams machine which is used in bakery was adopted from Britain thus this is beneficial as it helps to bring innovation in the country thus companies will gain a higher market share due to the production of quality products.
Businesses that trade internationally bring foreign currency to the country.This is of paramount importance as it helps to make importation of goods easier through the use of that foreign currency
23/08/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Question 4
Taking it back to 2021 when l was doing my part 4 ,my mom went through financial problems with starting her poultry project and she also lacked the necessary skills on how to take care of the chicks till they are mature for the market and also she lacked skills on how to manage her finances of sales and also purchases of feeds.

I helped her to make it easier for her to do her project since I did Agriculture as a subject when l was part 2.l went with her to purchase the chicks, bought feed and we were given instructions on how to take care of them from day one and we had to follow them one by one .

The chicks take a maximum of six weeks and a minimum of five weeks to be mature enough for consumption.So l took my time in taking care of the poultry,l would change the bedding after 3days and make sure they are not sick or even affected by any disease.

I also prepared books for her on her sales, purchases and expenses to see how much profit she had made for that batch and this really helped.
The chicks were 100and only one died and we were able to make profits of 75 USD and also we were able to order for the next batch .So in this case l applied my accounting techniques to cater for this project so that it becomes successful.
23/08/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Question 5
The Human Resource tends to be the heart of the organization because it plays a pivotal role in the success of a business.

HR is important as it helps in manpower planning which is looking for employees who are well acquainted with a variety of skills and expertise to operate sophisticated machinery and also the employment of part time employees for example a blanket manufacturer might need more employees towards and during the winter season.This is ideal as the business is able to meet customer demand for goods.

Moreso,HR helps in the recruitment and selection of employees.Only those who will pass interviews and even ability tests will be enrolled for that job thus this helps in excluding mischiefs and misfits on the organization.

Human resource is also important as it helps in training and development of employees.Training is a process of acquiring job related skills and expertise which are needed in the production process.This is beneficial as training helps to make employees flexible or able to perform a variety of tasks and also training ensures an increase in the business performance.


Furthermore,human resource aids in measurement of employee performance that is in performance appraisal.For example the business is able to identify potential employees for the promotion or other awards given .This is ideal as it motivates employees to achieve targets hence increasing the firm's productivity.

23/08/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
24/08/23, 1:10 am - +263 78 314 6204: Sorry l had network challenges at 9 so l couldn't connect with you and l had submitted the SOP
24/08/23, 1:10 am - +263 78 314 6204: Good morning
24/08/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright I understand. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
24/08/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
24/08/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
24/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Good afternoon Ms Kirti can we connect now
24/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes that's true
24/08/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay thank you
24/08/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
24/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes let's start
24/08/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
24/08/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
24/08/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes
24/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay okay
24/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
24/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
24/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
24/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes she did
24/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
24/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes understood
24/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes it is
24/08/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
24/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes l am following
24/08/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
24/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 314 6204: No l don't have.l have understood that
24/08/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
24/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay thank you
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
25/08/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

21/10/23, 9:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 986 2562: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 986 2562: Good morning Ms Kirti.I am available now.
21/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 986 2562: Let's discuss now
21/10/23, 10:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 986 2562: Yes I still remember the steps.
21/10/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 986 2562: Following the steps in their order am sure we are now at stage 3.Step  1 and 2 were already covered in August.
21/10/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. It is alright now to recall, that we are completed with step 3 as well. If you want I can help you recall, please.
21/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 986 2562: Okay am pleased to learn that we have completed the counseling stage as well.You can go ahead helping me to recall.
21/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
21/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 986 2562: Am ready you can proceed.
21/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
21/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
21/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 986 2562: Yes we are clear.Is the offer letter given before   A Level results are out or universities accept a student basing on the results at A level?
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you will understand it better when we discuss step 4, please do not worry.
21/10/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
21/10/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am clear on this.
21/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 986 2562: What determines the nature of a scholarship?
21/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 986 2562: How does a university select its student?I mean which results are used to accept a student?
21/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, the university decides the quantum of the scholarship by some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
21/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes clear
21/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you for the assurance
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

21/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am following
21/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

21/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ruvarashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I hear you.
21/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 986 2562: If it  is well with you, Monday- Friday  let's connect at 2:00pm for I am a teacher so I will be very busy with my class until then.
21/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that.
21/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thanks
23/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am available now
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes we're clear
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes it does
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay thanks
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for connecting with you yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.
25/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am excited
25/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay thank you and have a blessed day too
14/11/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes I did go through the offer letter.
15/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 986 2562: It's okay let's discuss.
15/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 986 2562: 1  $900us
2  3 years
3   $300
4.   $750
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes it does.
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I get it.As a foreign student, will it be possible to find own accommodation and cook as well?
15/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Hello
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it will certainly be possible we will be assisting you to find off-campus accommodations please after your arrival in India. Kindly excuse me for the delay I was on my dinner break please.
15/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Oh it's fine.hope you enjoyed your dinner.
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 986 2562: So the scholarship only covers part of tuition?
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you understand, Ideally, a scholarship is only provided for the Tuition fee, however, since you are enrolled through Edoofa, we make sure that the cost range we share with you covers your tuition fee, accommodation and food as well.
15/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am not understanding sorry about what Edoofa will be covering?
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779862562 Let me clarify for you. Typically, a scholarship covers only the tuition fees. However, as you are enrolled through Edoofa, we ensure that the cost range we provide you which is $ 2000 - $3000  includes not just your tuition, but also your accommodation and food expenses.
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay now I understand . Accommodation and food fees had hit me hard in the face when I earlier on looked at it.
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 986 2562: So the 50 percent is being given by Galgotias university right
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please and It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes it does.
15/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 986 2562: This is clear.
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Sorry can you please further explain this part
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you explain. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 986 2562: So am l paying 750 at once or l as  part payment to reserve the seat
15/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Now I understand.
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I reside in Mount Darwin.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you.
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 986 2562: It's okay .I think using Mr Rajan is the best option.
15/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please let me share the details just for reference.

16/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay thank you
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Oh sorry Ms Kirti I got your message very late and I thought it was wise to answer during our session.We are still connected and I was hoping to connect again at 5:00 pm like we did yesterday so as to ask a few questions.
16/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Yes I did understand this thanks.
16/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please if you are available right now we can connect?
16/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes I got it.Thank you.
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes it does Ms Kirti.So is this the only way that Edoofa gets in monetary wise to a student?
16/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Hello.May l know if we are  still connected?
16/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting and then followed by my dinner break, so was unable to get back to you, I was going through your query and I did not understand you well here, could you please help me understand your query better?
16/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 314 6204: My question is : As a parent of an Edoofian, what will be my actual expense towards my daughter's education?
16/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 314 6204: It's fine Ms Kirti.I was asking about Edoofa's input in terms of money  assisting a student.Maybe I failed to understand your explanation when you did   explain.
16/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Okay thank you
16/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Good afternoon Ms Kirti.I am well.I am available.
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
18/11/23, 7:39 am - +263 77 986 2562: Good morning Ms Kirti.Hope you are feeling much better today.I will be available at 8:30am.
18/11/23, 8:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Thank you for the concern, I am feeling better and I really appreciate it. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your queries and discuss the letter in detail?
18/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 986 2562: Hello am available Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 986 2562: Yes am available dear.
18/11/23, 9:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now coming back to the concern that you shared the other day, yes please, we at Edoofa, provide our assistance through the Earn While You Learn Program, as this program not only makes the student employable but it is also a self-funding program gives students the motivation to work more hard to reduce its own cost of education you know there are a student who can earn to $300 in a month and has been able to cater for their education through themselves without burdening their parents.
18/11/23, 9:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie Rukobo. She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
18/11/23, 9:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: You can connect with her through this number, +91 81781 20899
18/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you I will.
18/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 986 2562: Is Valerie the only one so far who has studied and working in India for now?
18/11/23, 9:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: No please, there are more students as well, since we connect with many students in a day.

+91 70879 73863, you can even connect with Persistence Muza.
18/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 986 2562: Okay
18/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 986 2562: After completing the degree program, is a student allowed to work in India?
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please to help you explain this query better let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing her studies in India she will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 9:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
18/11/23, 9:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
18/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 986 2562: Yes am answered let us continue.
18/11/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 986 2562: It's clear
18/11/23, 10:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herslef to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 10:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 986 2562: @263779862562 Let me clarify for you. Typically, a scholarship covers only the tuition fees. However, as you are enrolled through Edoofa, we ensure that the cost range we provide you which is $ 2000 - $3000  includes not just your tuition, but also your accommodation and food expenses.
18/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 986 2562: 👆🏼May you please elaborate on this
18/11/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please let me know the concern that you want me to elaborate here so that I can help you understand better?
18/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 986 2562: Does Edoofa gives a student $2000 _$3000 Ms Kirti?
18/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please let me help you understand when you analyze the expenses, students or parents are responsible for covering these costs. However, as you may recall from our initial discussions, the annual cost of a degree education in India typically ranges from $6000 to $8000. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you have qualified for a scholarship on your tuition fee, substantially reducing your overall education costs to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This amount includes not only your tuition fees but also accommodation fees, food costs, and basic amenities such as 24/7 wifi, electricity, and water bills.
19/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay you have explained clearly.
19/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 986 2562: My next question is on visa and air costs. How much is it?
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for your query, and I will surely be addressing the same in our discussion today in the evening since I am occupied with a meeting right now. I wanted to inform you that we will be connecting today at 06:00 pm CAT, to discuss the offer letter in more detail and address any queries that you might have. I hope you will be available, have a great day till then!
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I will be available.
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779862562 it is alright, I understand that due to work you must not be able to go through the message above, however, I mentioned that we will be connecting today at 06:00 pm cat.
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I have read it  and I will be available at 6:00pm
20/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Hello Ms Kirti I am available now for the session.
20/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now. Now coming back to the concern you shared. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student and for the visa the cost is $83.
20/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay this is affordable.
20/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 986 2562: My worry is on accommodation and food now that will l be able to afford the $2000.Ruvarashe as a girl child I have those fears that maybe my daughter might misbehave misbehave if outside the compass.She has no record of being a nuisance but as a mother I have those fears.Is it outside the compass safe please?I know you know better dear.
20/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your concern as a parent, If I had been at your place I would be going through the same feeling, however, let me share a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians who are staying off-campus together with Indian students and how they celebrated Diwali together one of the biggest Indian festival, and you can see how very well even the girl child feel at off-campus accommodations.
20/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 314 6204: Thank you this is amazing.
21/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 314 6204: My network was down so we will connect at 6pm
21/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents, and Ruvarashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. That is alright, please. Since we were unable to have to connect with us yesterday let us reconnect again today at 6:00 pm I hope you will be available.?
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Hello Ms Kirti
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Sorry my network misbehaved yesterday.
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263779862562 may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Good evening Ms Kirti am available now
21/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Wanted to ask whether accommodation fee is paid at once or we can split the payments.
21/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand if the students opt for on-campus accommodation then the fee would have to be paid at once and that is why our students opt for off-campus accommodation as there they will be able to pay the accommodation fee on a monthly basis directly to the landlord.
21/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you for letting me know.Definitely opt for the off- campus.
21/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
24/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 314 6204: I guess we have cleared all the questions ,,we can proceed

24/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Good afternoon.There are no questions concerning the offer letter Ms Kirti.
24/11/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is fantastic to hear. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
24/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Payment of the registration fee is yet to be done.The funds are not yet in place  and was wondering whether the university could give me a grace period of one more week.
24/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I am working towards it.Actually I was caught unaware.
24/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for telling me that, to help you here better, as per my understanding what you meant to say right now is that you be will be able to pay the registration fee of $600 by the 5th of December, may I know if understood you correct here?
24/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes this is according to my expectations
24/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, before we move ahead, I would like to know the challenges that you are facing in raising the first part of the registration fee which is $300 by November 28, maybe you can help me with that?
25/11/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruvarashe

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you however, you did not respond., I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet and must be occupied with some work. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
25/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 986 2562: Good morning Ms Kirti.Sorry I had netwrk challenges yesterday.I took a loan and started a project anticipating payments for the university would be done after the A level results are out.I started the project in preparation for Ruvarashe's education abroad.So am now operating with almost half salary.i started a small business so am hoping to raise the money for registration.
25/11/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you are working really hard for Ruvarashe, however, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student.
25/11/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: I would want to help you out but this is something that the university would not approve and in that case, even if the university agrees to help you with an extension they would not be able to give you the endowment benefits that have been offered which means that instead of making the payment of $600 you would have to make a payment of $750 now this would further add on the financial burden on your head.
25/11/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: To avoid this since you shared your concern with me earlier and on time what I can do is, I can see if it is possible to have a discussion with the Academic Board and make a plan for you for I would need to understand, how much have you been able to raise by now and how much will you be able to raise before the 28th of November 2023?
25/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am grateful for your concern Ms Kirti.I have  $150 at the moment and am hoping to raise     something very soon.I am looking forward to delivering my scrape first week of December to the market if all goes well.
25/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that completely since you were able to communicate with me, I will be able to assist you here. Now to ensure alignment with your preferences, I would like to get a confirmation from your end for the same payment plan. If you find this plan acceptable, I can connect with the team first thing tomorrow to explore the feasibility with the academic board. Hence, I would like to know if you are comfortable with the following payment plan, and do you believe it aligns with your financial capabilities?

1. $150 before 28th November 2023
2. $450 before 28th December 2023.
25/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes it is possible I will communicate with you.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to inform you that the payment for the first part of the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly.
09/12/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you further and provide clarity on the breakdown of your university registration fee, we have requested the accounts team to provide a summary. We have made every effort to obtain this information, and we are now ready to share it with you. Please find the details below, and kindly review them. If you come across any discrepancies or have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. However, if everything appears to be in order, please confirm that you have received and acknowledged the provided information.

University Name: Galgotias University

Registration Fee Due: $750
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $150 = $600

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Rajan
International Transfer Charges: $42 (07% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $600 + $42 = $642

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $160 (Paid on 28 November 2023)

Balance Amount Due: $642 - $160 = $482

09/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Good afternoon Ms Kirti.Thank u so much for the update.Everything is well understood.
11/12/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruvarashe.

And same to you
13/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 986 2562: Hello Ms Kirti I hope you are doing well.I have a question regarding how Edoofa receives its students  as soon as they land in India.Does the agent collects them or they are just left there to find their own means?
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope this message finds you in good health. 

I would like to kindly clarify a point of confusion: Edoofa is not an agent. An agent generally serves as a representative for businesses, focusing primarily on facilitating transactions. We are an organization dedicated to the welfare of our students. Our main goal is to provide affordable education options. Additionally, I can assure you that our officials will be present to assist Ruvarashe upon her arrival in India, guiding her all the way to the university. This level of support is something an agent typically does not offer.
13/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay Ms Kirti thank you very much.I had heard from someone that Edoofa does not receive students so it had gotten me worried.Thank you once again for clarifying my query.
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Could you please confirm the source of the information shared above, because clearly the information that has been informed to you is not true?
14/12/23, 7:59 am - +263 77 986 2562: Good morning Ms Kirti.I heard this from my daughter's friend who is in India.She was saying she heard this from a source that Edoofa does not receive the students and escort them to their final destination which is the university.It got me disturbed truly.She further advised us to find an agent so I told her I was a no turning back stage.That is why I decided to hear it from you.
14/12/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruvarashe.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, however, it is not true, could you please share her friend's name as well if you do not mind.
14/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Waal this is good.Am relieved now to know this.
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Don't mind about the name as long as this is clear to me.
14/12/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779862562 I understand that and I am happy to hear that your doubt is cleared, however, it is our responsibility that if a student of ours after arriving in India, believes in these rumors then I would like to make sure she is connected with her EWYL mentor or not, because you know good work of the people can be ignored with some bad rumors. I hope you understand what I mean here. Let me share more pictures with you as this was just one of the batch.
