Well l have been working on  being confident. I'm very detail-oriented, and I love to learn new things, but sometimes I get a little too caught up in the details and lose sight of the big picture. We are a family of four ..l have a young sister ,my mom and dad..well my parents and  l  belong to the middle class l mustn't say we are neither rich nor poor
My mom is a domestic worker in South Africa and my dad is a security guard in South Africa

It's wonderful to learn about your passion for netball and your commendable skills in problem-solving and teamwork at just 18 years old. Your family, which includes your parents, you, and your younger sister who is in grade 8 in South Africa, appears to be a tightly-knit and supportive group. As you anticipate your higher education journey abroad, it's heartening to know that you have the support of your parents, which is an invaluable asset in this endeavor.
18/12/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate.
