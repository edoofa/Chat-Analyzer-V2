30/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 994 5161: Morning mam we may proceed
30/09/23, 10:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam that  is correct
30/09/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 994 5161: Well yes mam last time l had to fill in the statement of purpose which you said plays a crucial role in finding a university. We also discussed that there will be a university admission process and the offer letter process then reserving my scholarship
30/09/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, may I know if you also recall the registration fee which you were informed about in our previous discussions?
30/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam i think it was 500 to 750
30/09/23, 11:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
30/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 994 5161: Oky mam l would like to ask if the registration fee ranges with the university which l  Would have chosen
30/09/23, 11:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please every university has its own registration fee, however, to be on the safer side we always say $750 so that it can be used ahead in the future.

I hope you understand?
30/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 994 5161: Oky l Understand mam
30/09/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
30/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam l am
30/09/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/09/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/09/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/09/23, 11:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 994 5161: We are very excited mam thank you very much for the dedication towards our education
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I have read the benefits mam
30/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Caroline, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Wow thats a great advantage for students under edoofa
30/09/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please now following along with the next steps.


2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/09/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/09/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky mam l Understand
30/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam l understand and this will make the payment process easier for students
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/09/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/09/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I understand mam the payments mam
30/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 994 5161: You can enlighten me on the process mam as lm not very familiar with it
30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/09/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
30/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky mam do you mean that a student secures a seat  in a university and 50% scholarship based on you previous results before you get your final Alevel results
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes @263789945161 and In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. 

I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement?
30/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam so the percentage of the scholarship is based on your performance in the final exam right
30/09/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam that is very correct
30/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam its clear
30/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam l understand the step
30/09/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I understand mam and the last one is not to be considered mostly
30/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well yes mam l Want to understand if   there are two scenarios to pay yoyr registration fee
1. Securing you university seat before your final exams and usinge your previous results
2.after you final Alevel results are our
30/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: This message was deleted

30/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Is this correct mam
05/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Caroline.

05/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I apologize for my late response mam
05/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your warm wishes, that is alright, please. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?

05/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Im available now
05/10/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now answer to your query above. Yes with the statement of entry for A-level, the university will be able to generate your offer letter, however, once your results are out if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
05/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Ooky mam now l understand
05/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well mam I just want to clarify on the certain aspects that edoofa or universities use to give a student the percentage of their scholarship
05/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Besides the final results
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789945161 once you receive the offer letter your doubts regarding the amount will also be cleared, please do not worry.
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky thank you mam l understand
05/10/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam l am  Very excited
05/10/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky mam l understand thank you very much
05/10/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
05/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Have a lovely evening as well

14/10/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
14/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 994 5161: 1.its $900
2.its 5 years
3. Its 300
4.its 750
14/10/23, 12:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
14/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes it is very clear sir
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
14/10/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
14/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky sir l wanted to ask if the price is fixed per person or per room
14/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: The prices for on-campus accommodation at Galgotias University are typically per person, not per room. In other words, the accommodation fees are usually charged on an individual basis, meaning each student occupying a room will be responsible for their portion of the fees. So, if you're in a three-seater AC room priced at $2000 per annum, each of the three students sharing that room would be expected to pay their share of the $2000 fee. The same principle applies to two-seater AC rooms priced at $2500 per annum. I hope this is cleaR?
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir it is
14/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
14/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir l understand
14/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
14/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir l understand
14/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
14/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir
14/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
14/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
14/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir its clear
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
14/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare? <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky sir
14/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 994 5161: So l wanted to ask that since I got the offer letter from galgotias does it mean that there won't be another offer letter from any other university sit
14/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Sir
14/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here dear. Now, I have taken a note of the same and stay assured that we will discuss the same towards the end of our discussion. For now, may you please let me know of this as well.
14/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky l Understand sir
14/10/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may you please answer this as well dear. <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: No sir I stay in the city of Gweru
14/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
14/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
14/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
14/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky l Understand sir
14/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mama Money, may I know if you would be able to use that mode again in order to make the payment of your registration fee?
14/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well I would need to discuss it with my father as he is the one who provides for me
14/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Right now he id bot available as he is preoccupied with work
14/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Based on the discussion that you will have with your father, you can let me know and then I will help you with the payment.
14/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky l Understand sir so this is the total fee before the scholarship deducts it amount right
14/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I want to clarify that the amounts I mentioned are already after the scholarship deduction, meaning you're all set with these reduced fees and these are the final costs that you would have to bear.
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 994 5161: So the 2800 is  the amount  that l personally have to pay
14/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that would be the per annum costs that you would have to bear after the scholarship please.
14/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky sir
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
14/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: OK sir
14/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: So am l. Supposed to pay this entire amount in full
14/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well dear, can you please come again which amount are you talking about here?
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky sir you said the 2800 is the total amount which a student pays per annnum after the scholarship has already deducted their share
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Right
14/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
14/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky sir  l understand but l had been hoping to study at Lovely Professional University
14/10/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask why is it that you wish to study at LPU dear, and where did you got to know about the same?
14/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I did a lot of research on Lovely Professional University and realized it is one of the top ranking universities not only in India but also in the world compared to Galgotias university. I had been hoping to study there the moment l applied at edoofa sir.
14/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. LPU is indeed one of the top universities here in India and it is also one of the partnered universities of Edoofa. Moving ahead, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
14/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope this is clear?
14/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir l understand
14/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
14/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir l completely understand its oky
14/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
14/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well I understand sir and l also don't want to waste this opportunity from Galgotias
14/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 994 5161: So now I will opt for galgotias
14/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, you can do that, however, are you aware how the transfer option works?
14/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 994 5161: No sir im Not
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Caroline!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Good evening sir
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I understand sie l hope you are doing well today
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky l Understand sir
15/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 994 5161: And this obviously makes things easier for students
15/10/23, 9:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, moving ahead, I believe you are clear about how the admission process will be navigated, right?
15/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir l do understand
15/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead?
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir it is clear
15/10/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well yes sir, I wanted to ask of l have to pay the total fees of 2800 all at once
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your question, and it's an important one. You do not have to pay the entire annual fee of $2800 all at once. The university provides students with the option to pay the fees in installments. So, you can pay the fees per semester or per year based on the payment schedule provided by the university. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Oky i understand now sir
15/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other query to ask please?
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I don't sir
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 994 5161: I don't have any questions as of now sir we may proceed
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Caroline!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?

17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Caroline!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. May I know if we can move ahead wit our discussion here now?

17/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 207 9733: We are very excited about the offer letter.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
18/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Good afternoon sir well it went well sir but l would like to ask a few questions
18/10/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what are those?
18/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Well from my research sir l discovered that Galgotias is a bit far from the city so where are the offcampus accomodation located are they near the school or a bit far from the school
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask where did you get this information from Caroline?
19/10/23, 1:44 am - +263 78 994 5161: From my research sir on Qoura
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Caroline!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your question, Caroline. I appreciate your curiosity and your research efforts. However, I must clarify that not everything you read on the internet, especially on platforms like Quora, can be considered completely accurate. Galgotias University is indeed located in the Delhi NCR (National Capital Region), and it is situated within an urban area, not far from the city.

The university's location provides students with access to the vibrant environment and resources of the city, which is crucial for your academic and personal growth.
19/10/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, when it comes to the off-campus accommodations, they are conveniently situated at walking distance from the university campus. This means that you won't have to worry about long commutes or transportation issues. I hope this is clear, right?
19/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Good afternoon sir
19/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 994 5161: Yes sir thank you very much
