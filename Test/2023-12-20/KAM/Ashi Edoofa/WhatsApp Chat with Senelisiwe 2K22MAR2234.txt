04/08/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sanelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan the senior admission officer here at Edoofa. Please kindly excuse us for not being able to connect with you till now since the whole team was occupied in the arrival of the first batch of students who just came to India this week. I appreciate your patience here and stay assured that I will be helping you with your admission journey ahead.
04/08/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when can we connect with each other to discuss the same please? <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for connecting with me here please. Now, when it comes to discussing about the scholarship opportunity, I would surely do that, however, before that, we will first be discussing about your finances please. 

Now, that you have mentioned about facing financial challenges, can you please help me in understanding about how is it that you are prepared for the admission financially and along with that can you please also let me know how much is it that you can afford for your higher education?
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - +27 63 894 3050: Good afternoon
11/09/23, 3:30 pm - +27 63 894 3050: Currently lm not working and lm failing to fund Sanelisiwe's education.
11/09/23, 3:33 pm - +27 63 894 3050: I have tried to look for Sponsors to help fund Sanelisiwe's studies but unfortunately l didn't get any.
11/09/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, in that case, can you please also let me know how is it that you wish to move ahead with Senelisiwe's higher education?
11/09/23, 4:10 pm - +27 63 894 3050: Sanelisiwe wishes to fulfill her dreams of going to study at the University.But because of financial problem she is at home now.We are kindly asking if it's possible for her to get a fully funded Scholarship,we will greatly appreciate.
11/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I would like to mention that being an Edoofian assures to get you a 50-100% scholarship. Now, what we can do is that we can try to get you a higher quantum of scholarship, however, fully funded scholarship would not be possible since we do not offer that please.
11/09/23, 4:46 pm - +27 63 894 3050: May you kindly explain the meaning of higher quantum Scholarship.Thanks

12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Senelisiwe, when I say that we can try to get you a higher quantum of scholarship, then by that I mean that we can try to get you a much higher scholarship opportunity where you can get around 90-100% scholarship after which the total per annum costs of your higher education would come down to $1500-1900.  Now, what do you think about that?
12/09/23, 2:51 pm - +27 63 894 3050: Good afternoon Sir
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - +27 63 894 3050: So that would mean Sanelisiwe will have to pay $1500-$1900 per year?
12/09/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. The total per annum costs of her higher education here in India would come down to $1500-1900 per annum. What are your thoughts on that?
12/09/23, 3:09 pm - +27 63 894 3050: My problem is that lm looking after Sanelisiwe as a single parent and lm not working at the moment.I don't have anyone to help me with her fees.Unless if she will get points from EWYL program that will help her to raise the money.It was also not easy for me to raise the money to secure a seat at the University.
12/09/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please help me in understanding more about how much is it that you can afford per year for continuing with Senelisiwe's higher education apart from the support that you will get from the EWYL Program?

20/09/23, 12:05 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Afternoon.  I'm well thanks and how are you?

I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Senelisiwe, it has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here, may I know if everything is alright dear?
21/09/23, 11:09 am - +27 84 642 0971: Good morning, how are you?
21/09/23, 11:12 am - +27 84 642 0971: Everything else is fine. What is not fine is that lm still not aware of what you have decided about offering me a better scholarship since lm not able to finance the half you had proposed.  May we please come to that verdict and move on !
21/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, regarding that, I had asked a question some time back here in the group to your mother, tha was unanswered. Hence, can you please let me know about how much is it that your mother can afford for your higher education here in India so that on the basis of that we can plan the next steps in your admission journey?

22/09/23, 6:44 am - +27 84 642 0971: Good morning.  Honestly speaking at the moment there's no amount my mother can afford because she's not employed and my father is out of the picture.  This year my mother is not working, she doesn't have a cent.  Now for me to proceed learning lm praying for a fully funded scholarship   a sponsor or a donor. Nothing is promising about me becoming financially stable soon that I might go to varsity then hence l can not and do not wish to lose this opportunity.
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear, thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, since you have also mentioned that you are looking for a fully funded scholarship, I believe you would not be able to get the same in Zimbabwe as well, right?
26/09/23, 9:47 am - +27 84 642 0971: Greetings
26/09/23, 9:49 am - +27 84 642 0971: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Senelisiwe, may I know if you were able to go through this message of mine dear?
26/09/23, 4:23 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Yes
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Just now
26/09/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since you are aware that you cannot get a fully funded scholarship in Zimbabwe as well, I believe you understand that it is not possible in India too, right?
26/09/23, 4:38 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I can get it in Zimbabwe, however since l has a hope of going to lndia l didn't apply as much and the one that l had of going to study in Algeria wasn't offering law studies hence l left it.
26/09/23, 4:39 pm - +27 84 642 0971: In my EWYL sessions l have received lessons of encouragement from students even from Zimbabwe who have a fully funded scholarship program,  how then is it not possible for me when lm actually vulnerable?
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note Senelisiwe, firstly I would like to mention that getting a fully funded scholarship is not very easy therefore, if you think that you would easily be able to get that in Zimbabwe you can surely move ahead to look for that and then let me know.
27/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, in that case, can you please share the names of the students who have informed you about getting a fully funded scholarship please?
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Good evening
27/09/23, 9:38 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I understand.  Scholarship applications for this year have been long closed, so l don't stand a chance, l missed it.
27/09/23, 9:42 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I would have definitely given you that,  however, unfortunately I can't remember straight because I learnt about them last year with Ms. Riva being my mentor. I  can only remember that the other girl child plays cricket and the other one does agricultural science studies.  And yes ,they're Zimbabwean.  But it's okay,  l appreciate what you are able to do for me within your capabilities in terms of me getting to learn in lndia with your help. God bless!
27/09/23, 9:43 pm - +27 84 642 0971: How many percent scholarship do you think l can be offered by your institution looking at my financial background?
28/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that with the help of our partnered universities, we can arrange for a higher quantum of scholarship, i.e. 90-100% for the course that you wish to pursue. Now, the cost of your higher education after that scholarship would be around $1600-1800 per annum, what do you think about tha?
29/09/23, 10:53 am - +27 84 642 0971: Good morning.  I hope you're well.  Well , looking at my mother's financial status,  l can't say with assurance that she'll be able to raise that much money, because she's not employed and has no source of income.
29/09/23, 10:54 am - +27 84 642 0971: I wish she becomes able to cover that
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: /.n
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senelisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, on that note, since I have mentioned that after getting 90-100% scholarship the other expenses would be in this mentioned range, how do you wish to move ahead with your higher education now?
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Senelisiwe!

I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission officer at Edoofa.

I am excited to inform you that from here on, I will be personally coordinating with you and will make sure that you will be assisted with you all the right information and make this journey count. 

With that in mind, I would like to kindly inquire about your availability for a connection. I want to ensure that our communication aligns with your schedule. Please let me know when it would be most convenient for you to connect.
28/10/23, 4:10 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Greetings ms. Ashi. I'm doing well. I hope you're well.
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Senelisiwe, I hope you are having a good day!

With respect to our discussion, I have had the opportunity to review your conversation with Mr. Milan. It appears that he had discussed the possibility of a more quantum scholarship opportunity with you back in September. However, it seems that due to certain circumstances, you have not been able to reconnect with him on this matter.

Now, I would like to emphasize that you have two options. Firstly, you may choose to continue your application at LPU by taking a term-off, if that aligns with your preferences. Alternatively, we can explore more regarding securing a higher quantum of scholarship. 

It is essential that you confirm your preferred course of action within the next 24 hours. By doing so, we can expedite the process, as we have already experienced delays and wish to ensure that we utilize our time effectively to meet your needs. <This message was edited>

19/12/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @27688037714 to the group!
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - +27 68 803 7714: Good afternoon.
19/12/23, 12:56 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Misc fee $ 125
Annual fee $3500
Per annum $350
Accommodation $0
19/12/23, 12:58 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Annual fee $1600
Sports $125
19/12/23, 12:59 pm - +27 84 642 0971: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
19/12/23, 1:16 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Right
19/12/23, 1:16 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I'm following
19/12/23, 1:18 pm - +27 84 642 0971: On annual fee ABCDEF how come 10% of $5550 is $1600, isn't it supposed to be $555
19/12/23, 1:18 pm - +27 84 642 0971: ?
19/12/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here, As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/12/23, 1:27 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Oh so you mean the 10% l'm supposed to pay is $1600 every year for 5 years
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @27846420971
19/12/23, 1:29 pm - +27 68 803 7714: Ok l understand
19/12/23, 1:30 pm - +27 68 803 7714: Do you still offer EWYL program?
19/12/23, 1:33 pm - +27 84 642 0971: So that's $8000 total of 5 years plus $250 first year tuition
19/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27688037714 Yes, EWYL program is still going on
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 68 803 7714: Noted.Thanks
19/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @27688037714, Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/12/23, 1:51 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Yes lm clearly following
19/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?

19/12/23, 1:56 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Well, l have been doing this EWYL program for 3 years now, but l have changing mentors now and then to an extent of that l no longer understand the sequence of my credits.  My last mentor miss.Riva had updated me that my credits were worth $345 but my new mentor updated me that my credits are equal to $24 , how well and sure are you about the credibility of this program?
19/12/23, 2:00 pm - +27 84 642 0971: ...been*
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27846420971 I understand that you have been working with the EWYL mentors, as you have shared that there is some discrepancy in your credits I would love to clarify the same for you so that you have a better understanding. Hence, May I know if you are connected with your mentor right now?
19/12/23, 2:04 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Awesome. Okay.  Well not now, let me check if she is available
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear,  I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
19/12/23, 2:11 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Okay
19/12/23, 2:11 pm - +27 84 642 0971: You mean for the first year l have to pay $1850 or $850
19/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850- $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I get it now
19/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 to secure their scholarship seat with the university. As you have already made a payment of $700 for your registration fees, you will be required to pay the remaining $300 in order to reserve your seat at the MVN University, I hope you understand?
19/12/23, 2:29 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I understand and I had paid $750
19/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you don't mind, Could you please share the receipt with us for the amount you have paid?
19/12/23, 9:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I am looking forward for your response. I want to share that it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 3:00 PM.  I hope you will be available for the discussion, Have a great night ahead
19/12/23, 9:45 pm - +27 68 803 7714: Noted.Thanks
19/12/23, 9:46 pm - +27 84 642 0971: I don't think I have that receipt as of now because I lost my phone which had all documents pertaining to this scholarship offer . But lm sure Mr. Milan and Mr Austin can bring those documents up.
19/12/23, 9:47 pm - +27 84 642 0971: Okay thank you
