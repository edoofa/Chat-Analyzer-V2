25/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
25/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok. Yes
25/10/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 368 2925: I'm done.
25/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
25/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, it's clear
25/10/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
25/10/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
25/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, am following well. Can continue
25/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 368 2925: What determines the amount to pay since you are saying from $500 - $1000?
25/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713682925 Thank you for your query, however. Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
25/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, all steps clear.
25/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
25/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Unfortunately heading to a place with no network now.
25/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, you can watch the videos by tomorrow.
25/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok fine, thank you
25/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
25/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Afternoon, hope you are doing great.
26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 368 2925: I'm sorry have got electricity challenge due to winds and rain so phone will be charging by the time I collect will be late but once our electricity line is rectified hope to connect well.

26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you for your patience.
26/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Hope to hold that conversation tomorrow.
26/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand the challenges you're facing with electricity and network issues. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with us now?
27/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that the network can be a challenge, however, Monday will be a long time, please and at the pace we are moving I doubt you will be able to start with Makanakaishe's EWYL program on time on the 31st of October.

06/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now since Makanakaishe is occupied and is not able to complete the tasks by now, I would suggest we keep that part of step 2 on hold and we can move ahead with our discussion so that we do not delay the admission process. May I know if this plan sounds acceptable to you?
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 368 2925: If it is acceptable to you I don't have any problem with that.
06/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can do that however, I would want you to encourage Makanakaishe to complete the tasks soon since the Academic Board is present in the group and they will be going through her responses as well and delay can have a negative impact on her scholarship application. I hope you understand?
06/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 368 2925: I do. The problem is her phone which can not make an audio so she'll come to me and do that. Otherwise she's done with other questions.
06/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 148 7441: 1. Will work on it using my dad's phone since mine is unable to make audios

3. A PROSECUTOR is a lawyer who decides whether to charge a person with a crime and tries to prove in court that the person is guilty, while an ATTORNEY is a lawyer who advises or represents others in legal matters as a profession, hence the difference is that a prosecutor will be responsible for charging the crime that the accused are being tried for in contrast an attorney will do the opposite meaning he/she will be trying to prove innocent.

06/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that I understand and thank you for sharing the academic interview question, I shall wait for your response to question1.
06/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
06/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
06/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Very correct, she wants to pursue BA in Legislative Law in India as per August 2024 intake.
06/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
06/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, am ready.
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
06/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I am able to follow very well.

Yes should study at one university.
06/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
06/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I
06/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, very clear.
06/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
06/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, we are on the same page.
06/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
06/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, noted.
06/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
06/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, very clear.
06/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Network is slow now.
06/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Almost 25minutes without network.
06/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It seems like you’ve got the information you needed, which is great. However, the network instability sounds quite troublesome, especially with it being down for almost 25 minutes. Network issues can really disrupt communication. May I know if you are connected to a stable network by now?
06/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, you can go ahead now seems to be stable.
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok noted.
06/11/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 368 2925: So far so good, no queries.
06/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have no queries so far. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Hope and pray that it can come to pass that our daughter can get an offer letter if not letters. Surely will be excited because will know definitely that she'll be part of the Edoofians August 2024 intake.
06/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Thank you for your promises and for all you are doing now for our sake.
06/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Wow, this is great hope next year by this time will be looking at a picture whereby our daughter will be part of it.
06/11/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and we are as excited as you are to watch Makanakaishe in this picture for next year I am sure she is going to make you proud.
06/11/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
06/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok it's clear. You can go ahead.
06/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Makanakaishe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok can go ahead, it's clear
06/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, sounds well and clear
06/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, sounds well.
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Well detailed, can go ahead.
06/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, but might add more information.
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
06/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, surely Endowment plan gives an edge movement. Clear now
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 368 2925: True
06/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Heading to my place where there's no network.
06/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Can you kindly continue the session tomorrow, thank you.
06/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that network can be a challenge, however, the discussion will not take much of your time if you are available?
06/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok.
06/11/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 6:36 am - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, I agree.
07/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Makanakaishe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Very very excited and looking forward for the best for our daughter.
07/11/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know by when will you be able to share Makanakaishe's identity proof?
07/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Hopefully on Thursday.Thus her birth certificate <This message was edited>

07/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok

11/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

17/11/23, 6:54 am - +263 71 368 2925: Good morning, hope you are doing great.
17/11/23, 6:55 am - +263 71 368 2925: Wow! This is unbelievable, great news indeed. We are more than happy.
17/11/23, 7:03 am - +263 71 368 2925: Sorry had no network where we stay.
I propose 0900hrs to reconnect.
17/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 368 2925: 1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?

$350

2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?

$0

3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?

$1600

4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

$250

5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?

$1000
17/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Network not stable. But can continue.
17/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, indeed.
17/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Well explained
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Makanakaishe's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Well explained, can go on.
17/11/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, very clear.
17/11/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, it clarifies how advantageous EWYL is.
17/11/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Wonderful
17/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 368 2925: So when is the deadline for payment of Admission and Processing Fee?
Since we haven't seen the email.
17/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $1200 to $1800 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
17/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please do not worry we will be sharing that as well.
17/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($1200 to $1800).
17/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
17/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok thank you
17/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Makanakaishe is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
17/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
17/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
17/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 368 2925: I think we are happy with the offer especially if it's the best university offering Law. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Getting to a zone or area without network soon.
17/11/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/11/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand and you can respond when your network gets better.
17/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Is it possible that you can communicate with MVN University so that they can send the email of Offer Letter to me since her  phone is not working.
17/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 368 2925: etmmutasa@gmail.com
17/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok it's clear
17/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I shall talk with the team and shall share the update with you regarding this soon.
17/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
17/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Makanakaishe through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Makanakaishe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok thank you
18/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok
18/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, can you explain further
18/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 368 2925: Good morning Ms Kirti. Hope you are doing great.
18/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 368 2925: Just read your messages now.
18/11/23, 8:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great that is alright please may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 368 2925: Unfortunately, my battery low and no electricity.
18/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 368 2925: 👆🏻But you can explain on this.
18/11/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. 
Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 30 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, will take this option.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 368 2925: Yes, clear now
18/11/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 368 2894: Greetings. 
In Zimbabwe we stay in Bulawayo the second capital city but most of the time at work we will be in the rural areas outskirts of the city.
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 368 2894: Ok thanks a lot
 Will contact him
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
20/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Makanakaishe.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.

21/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me attend to the query shared by you regarding the official admission letter - The letter is issued by the university once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, thought you had say we will receive ours too. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand, however, please do not worry the letter that we have shared is also issued by the university once you complete Makanakaishe's admission process they would even be sharing the admission acceptance letter as well.
21/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok.
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, so may I know if you would like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
