For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Ok Ma'am we can start
01/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 693 6199: I am done
01/08/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes
01/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Ok
01/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes
01/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

01/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

02/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, you are doing well, great so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
02/08/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 114 3633: The videos talks about successful students who are different from others,brief reference of schools, colleges and universities under Edoofa,The history of Edoofa, Importance of Statement of purpose to get a  good scholarship
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mcwillard.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Thank you Ma'am
03/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
04/08/23, 12:41 am - +263 78 114 3633: Thank you we can proceed
04/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mcwillard.

04/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes ma'am l am available
04/08/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.

04/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Question 1

04/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 114 3633: 2.) Rights are the privileges given to a citizen which are protected by the constitution but duties are something you are required to do for moral or legal reasons.Rights are what you are constitutionally entitled to while duties are what you are to do concerning the rights.

A right refers to a legal entitlement or immunity granted by law ,while a duty refers to an obligation ( a responsibility) that someone has under the law.

A right is a power or claim possessed by an individual to do something and duty is an obligation to do or omit to do something.

Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive .Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state.

Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country , while human rights are derived from natural law.

Human rights arise simply by being a human being.Civil rights,on the other  hand , arise only by virtue of a legal grant of that rights
04/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 114 3633: 3.)A prosecutor and an attorney are both lawyers who have completed law school and passed the bar examination.

One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while an  attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain their clients innocence.

The prosecutor in legal proceedings usually argues in favor of the government, either at the state federal level .They seek to enforce the laws, finding justice through charging and successfully prosecuting the person a ccused of a crime

Regardless of what level of government they work for, a prosecutor's ultimate responsibility is to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.They do this by using intensive investigations , gathering solid evidence or proof of the alleged crime and by establishing a motive for the accused

Attorney,on the other hand, represent the defendant,who is the person who has been accused of wrong doing. It is their legal responsibility to call into question any evidence or posturing by the prosecution.

04/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 114 3633: 4.) Criminal laws are the rules that apply when someone commits a crime , such as assault, robbery ,murder ,arson ,rape and other kinds of crimes .After a person is arrested and charged with a crime ,that person goes to a Criminal Court

Civil law refers to almost all other disputes -these are the rules that appy when one person sues another person, a business or agency.This can cover a housing case such as divorce or custody , consumer problems such as debt or bankruptcy, or when someone sues for money because of damage to property or personal harm .All of these cases go to a civil Court.

The judges in criminal and civil court have different powers.Criminal court judges can punish you for breaking the law by sending you to jail . Civil court judges can order you to pay money or a fine ,or make decisions about your family or your home.

I am interested in both categories of law but l mostly favor civil law because l want to be involved in issues that happens in social lives of people everyday.l understand that people are different and in social cases all characters and attitudes must be considered and understand.One should be analytical and good researcher.

My life experience caused me to be interested in civil law .My parents divorced and they in court to finalize their decision.l want to promote social justice and gender equity.People must not be used to social upheavals,ther must be peace and oder
04/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 114 3633: 5.)l believe in myself to be the successful lawyer because l have many features that are considered by many people in successful individuals.

I am someone who always pay attention to detail.l see this when l am in a lesson or during debate l put the information in my fingers and drop it when it will be my turn to present or debate the opponent side.

I really appreciate working in teams .lf people join forces they actually give good results or outcomes .l don't look down on  other people's ideas but l analyze the sense of that point and then research.

I am an independent lady,l don't rely on people.l stand for my rights and fight for the best for everyone.l am skilled with verbal and written communication.l also work well under pressure and l am very strong .


I believe all the above skills l have can help me to be a successful lawyer of that year .Thank you.

08/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes l agree it's not possible
08/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
08/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
08/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
08/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Ok l understand
08/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes
08/08/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
08/08/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes I understand
08/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
08/08/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes very clear
08/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
08/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes l am following
08/08/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
08/08/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 693 6199: For now no bt me and my parents we can discuss and in those discussions questions maybe found and l will ask
08/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
08/08/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Ok thank you Ma'am
08/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

19/10/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, however, could you please share a clearer picture of the statement of entry?
19/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok
19/10/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I shall wait for your response.
19/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 114 3633: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Accurate
19/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 114 3633: I wrote my statement of purpose
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
19/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 114 3633: No
19/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
19/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
19/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
19/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 10:57 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 11:02 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes diploma Will be for how many years
19/10/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Diploma is a 3 year course.
19/10/23, 11:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
19/10/23, 11:34 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok
19/10/23, 11:34 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Same to you 😘
20/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Mcwillard,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 397 1947: Afternoon, I am available but McWillard, who is the most important stakeholder in this discussion is not reachable and far from my reach for now
20/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 114 3633: I am now available
20/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 114 3633: We can proceed
20/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I would like to reschedule our discussion for 08:00 pm CAT today. I hope that this new time works for you and that you'll be available to connect then. Thank you for your understanding.
20/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok l understand get well now
20/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, following our prior conversation, I am pleased to inform you that I'm feeling better now. I would like to inquire if you are currently ready and available to join our discussion?
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 114 3633: I am available
20/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, let us now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok ok so my question now is that for my course l must have how many points
20/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand for your course and for you to receive a 50% scholarship a minimum of 2 E passes are required however, if they get more than that and if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

I hope we are clear now?
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 114 3633: No
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes l am
20/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Thank you so much.l will pass your greetings.I will be waiting for the offer letter
14/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

15/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Good evening Ma'am
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
15/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Yes ma'am you can proceed
15/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 114 3633: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?900 USD
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?5 years ( 10 semesters)
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?300 USD
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?750 USD
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Before we go to accomodations I want to know about Admission and procedure fee (waived off under early registration) which  means we are not going to pay
15/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263781143633 we will be explaining you everything step by step as we move ahead with our discussion I would encourage you to be patient and note down all your queries so that we can discuss them later on at the end of our discussions please.
15/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Thank you ma'am
15/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok ok
15/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 114 3633: I understand
15/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes go on
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes we are
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes l am confused
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

Message after acknowledgment
15/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 397 1947: Thank you I think this is clear
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 397 1947: How much are suppose to pay per semester
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please I will get back to your query as well in the coming discussion.
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Thank you
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok
15/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Student university ID fee should be paid after l reach India or
15/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 114 3633: What about caution /ERP fee wat is it about
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Alevel results pending please submit before regstratin
15/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 114 3633: What does this mean
15/11/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand these all fees are miscellaneous fees like the student ID fees when the student arrives in India for him/her to get entry into the university there is a student ID required, the caution ERP is the medical insurance fee which is a one-time payable fee, please. 

May I know if you are clear?
15/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me clarify if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
16/11/23, 5:05 am - +263 78 114 3633: Yes I am clear
16/11/23, 5:05 am - +263 78 114 3633: Yes yes
16/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mcwillard.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes go on
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
16/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities.

16/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Wow it is a beautiful University
16/11/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and indeed it is one of the best universities, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
16/11/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
16/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day evening ahead and do convey mu regards to your family.
16/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Okay
18/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 11:30 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Ok ma'am
20/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mcwillard!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 693 6199: She is at school now
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 693 6199: Good afternoon
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I am sure you as her parents were able to have a discussion regarding the offer letter?
20/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 114 3633: Yes , yes
20/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mcwillard,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 397 1947: Good afternoon Officer

Sorry for the delay in responding to you question.

However as the family we are delighted with the offer. As a family we may have some challenges to meet the total amount needed for a year. I think we are not getting clearly how the Earn Whilst Learning works behides the offer from the scholarship
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, could you please help me understand your concern better, and elaborate as to what is exactly you are not able to understand in the EWYL program?
21/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 397 1947: Ok my intial understanding was that :
1. Edoofa Scholarship over help with half of the fee
2. The student shall also contribute to her by Working Whilst learning, which I think will help reduce the half payment which I am suppose to pay as a parent
Meaning for tuition I will pay less that US$900
21/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, what you have understood is absolutely correct, we promised you that we would be helping your child secure a 50% scholarship, and we did fulfill that, please. Now, EWYL is an added benefit here, where if the student works hard and consistently he/she will be able to earn more credits as well. There have been students in India, who are able to earn $300 per month and are able to cater for their higher education without burdening their parents. 

 I hope you are clear now?
21/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 397 1947: Thank you clear now we can go ahead
