I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Let's start
01/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Downloading
01/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Am. done
01/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Okay
01/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Alright
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Should I ask a question that, are all the steps done before A level results are out?
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we will move step by step everything will be clear to you.
01/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 932 0751: So far so good and the process wonderful it seems the Students will be in good hands
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate that. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Let's do only step 1 for I have to be at home by 3 to do my updates
01/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please if you recall the admission cycle the message from the founders is step 1 only and we have not been proactive in the journey hence we are only at step 1 till now, other peers to Aisha have completed step 4. I hope you understand why I always keep saying that we need to be proactive, please?
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Noted ma'm
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?

04/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings everyone .Maam Kirt  ,well i have managed to go through the videos and audios so here is the summary of my understanding:
 *From* *video* *1*
Message for enrolled students there are 2 key points to be noted that include 1- following instruction and 2- a student should be open minded and teachable
 *Video* *2*
It's all about how some students have managed it through the Edoofa scholarship program 
Also agood attitude is expected from students so as to have capacity to win sucess
 *Video* *3*
Its about the colleges and universities under Edoofa
The founders have managed to discover some challenges that were being faced by students and they had found solutions in the ten year course of foundation
In this video it also signified that a lot of time had been invested to convience some colleges and universities to give seats for scholarship for Edoofians.
Edoofa focuses on high quality education , life skills and attitude will bring an Edoofian a necessary training and will pass with flying colours.
 *Video* *4* 
Here its all about th Statement of Purpose (SOP) - this is the only subjective document that gives an opportunity to any student to convince the admission board.
This statement should include the student's vision toward the particular course they want to undertake,the academic progress and also the student's strengths.
The admission team will give the student a form and  indicate the amount of time to invest on the form.
Overally the SOP is an important document , students should be prompt in taking action and be deligent in filling out the form.
04/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 951 6687: May you kindly assist if there are some areas that i didn't understand
06/11/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 932 0751: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Afternoon everyone. We can comnect
06/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Due to network services Aisha is currently using this phone for now
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. That is aright please, thank you for sharing your understanding Aisha. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

08/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms Ananya_ and she has scheduled my session for __Monday to Friday 1:30PM to 2:30 PM_"
08/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings maam im now answering the academic qsns
08/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Below are the answers
08/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 951 6687: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Relationship* *between* *Entrepreneurship* *and* *economic* *development*: Entrepreneurship is often considered to be a key driver of economic development. This is because entrepreneurs create new businesses, which in turn create jobs and generate wealth. In addition, entrepreneurs tend to be innovators who develop new products and services that can improve the standard of living for society as a whole. So you see, there is a strong link between entrepreneurship and economic development.
08/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Understanding* *of* *GAAP* *and* *its* *importance* :
GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are a set of guidelines and rules that govern how companies prepare their financial statements. They're important because they help to ensure that financial statements are consistent, reliable, and easy to understand. They also help to prevent companies from manipulating their numbers to look more profitable than they actually are. By following GAAP, companies can provide investors and other stakeholders with an accurate picture of their financial health.
So you see, by following GAAP, companies can give investors and other stakeholders the information they need to make informed decisions about their investments. Without GAAP, it would be much harder
08/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *What* *are* *Accounting* *standards* *and* *why* *are* *they* *mandatory* ? Accounting standards, also called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), are a set of rules and standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. They are designed to promote consistency and comparability of financial information, and to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a way that is transparent and understandable. GAAP are mandatory because they help to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a way that is accurate and reliable, and that investors and other users of financial statements can make informed decisions.
08/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Difference* *between* *Accounting* *and* *Auditing* : accounting is the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions, while auditing is the process of examining and verifying the accuracy of financial statements and records. Accounting deals with financial data, while auditing focuses on evaluating and providing an opinion on the accuracy of that data. In other words, accounting is about recording and processing the numbers, while auditing is about checking and verifying those numbers.
08/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing the session time with us.

08/11/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when will you be able to share your identity proof?
08/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 951 6687: On Friday
08/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges, since it is just a picture of identity proof and students are able to share them within the same day?
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 951 6687: The identity is in Masvingo and i will go there tomorrow
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please you can share that by tomorrow. In the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us?
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am we can connect
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
08/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
08/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes  exactly
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow this sounds awesome
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes specifically Accounting and fianance
08/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes I am ready to start
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes that's quite clear
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thank you for sharing this information with me
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We haven't reached to that discussion yet but anyways that's great news to me
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, however, I am here referring to the counseling sessions that you had with your counselor and he must have informed the same?
08/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!

09/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings team team .Sorry ma'am for late responses my network has been tripping
09/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the identity proof, it is duly noted with us. That is alright, please I understand that the network can be a  challenge.
09/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thank you for your understanding ma'am
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now I would like to inform you that we will not be available from the 10th of November to the 13th of November on the occasion of the biggest festivals coming up Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok Maam thanks for informing
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and have a great day ahead.
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thanks you I'm also wishing you the same
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, and thank you for your wishes.
14/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings..Hello can we connect if your holiday is over
14/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Yes, please It was a great time with my family during the festival. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes that's nice to hear from you hope you had a blessed festival.we can connect
14/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I had a blessed festival. I am glad to hear that we can connect now. May I know if you are clear so far?
14/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Clear in terms of what specifically
14/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: What I mean to ask is if you have any doubts so far?
14/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well i only have a few questions ma'am can i ask
14/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
14/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well is this scholarship fully funded or ...
14/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
14/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 951 6687: When is a student offered a100% scholarship
14/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When the student performs exceptionally well in his her A level along with the other factors mentioned above.
14/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok thanks for clarifying
14/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Mmm can you explain further
14/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 951 6687: So does that mean i will be paying $1350 per annum
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow i can understand now
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow amazing
14/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 951 6687: No quiries
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow
14/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It was really heartwarming to meet them finally, I hope you are exited to be in this picture for next year batch as well?
14/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Exactly i can't wait
14/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see your enthusiasm. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings maam
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Can we connect
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well we can connect
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok well may you kindly further explain point 2
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Aisha, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
15/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow amazing🥳
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am that quite clear
15/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
15/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 951 6687: So does this mean that i will then be paying let's say on the example above ..i will be paying $900 in the whole first year
15/11/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please this is just the registration fee which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
15/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Am i getting it or I'm lost ma'am
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well this is good to know and quite clear
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/11/23, 11:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: May you kindly provide more information on this one
15/11/23, 11:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have loved to, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Aisha,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since we were unable to continue our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We can connect
16/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response earlier, however, I am not available to connect now, could you please confirm that you will be available tomorrow at 12:30 pm without delays?
17/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings, can we connect
17/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am we can proceed
17/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 951 6687: My apologies for yesterday ma'am
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am
18/11/23, 7:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 8:25 am - +263 77 932 0751: Morning ,we can connect now
18/11/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yes ma'am
18/11/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 932 0751: May you kindly provide more information on this one
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 932 0751: Wow this is quite clear
18/11/23, 8:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yeah is the any other options?
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 932 0751: Ok
18/11/23, 9:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/11/23, 9:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 932 0751: Wow
18/11/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/11/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 932 0751: Noted
18/11/23, 9:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.

Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
