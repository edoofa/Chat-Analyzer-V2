01/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
02/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, That is alright, I completely understand, it must have been a challenge without electricity. Please understand that our discussion hours are from 07.30 pm to 11.00 pm, so having discussion at 04.00 PM will not be possible for me.
02/08/23, 2:37 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Okay I understand
02/08/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, since you mentioned that you were able to go through the videos so could you please share your understanding of the videos in detail?
02/08/23, 3:04 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Video 1: I understood 
that most people fail in life due to their lack of interest to learn and improve themselves . Always wishing but doing nothing to turn that wish into a reality. 

In order to succeed one has to know what they want  to achieve . 
Being persistent and going through the right channels to get help to achieve  the goal .

Following instructions  , having an open mind and the willingness to learn . Are keys towards success
02/08/23, 3:18 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Video 2:   Students normally have problems with higher education fees.
They also have problems when trying to get employed . They also struggle to apply what they have learned in the work environment due to the fact that all they have  learned has been theory .

Edoofa has identified all those problems. Making it possible to get students affordable , quality education and making students employable through the Student of Edoofa Earning and learning to Success program . Also focusing on increasing their capacity of success . Making students responsible and independent
02/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response, for the response of other videos.
02/08/23, 3:37 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Video 3: The students experience in College'sand Universities contributes to their performance academically .
The founders of the Edoofa program have taken a parental approach . Aiming towards the students happiness , success in academics and their chosen carrier field. 

 The  Edoofa program's main focuses are :
●Quality of teaching staff
●Value of the program 
●Opportunities provided to students
●Culture 
●Accreditation 
Etc.

They have invested 10 years in research towards " what makes a student employable " 
The goal is to not just to make students theory smart but also practically smart too.
So that they are able to apply what they learn into their lives as well .  
Through the Earn While You Learn program .
02/08/23, 3:44 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Video 4 : The student has to convince the College's and Universities why the student qualifies for the program.

This is to be done by displaying the students unique trates, strengths, skills, abilities and achievements. 

The student is to showcase his/her goals and vision. The students  academic progress and reasons on why that particular course .
Honesty and sincerity will go a long way in the student SOP Statement of Purpose
02/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
02/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
02/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
02/08/23, 3:59 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes I understood all that was being said in the videos.

May I ask a question?
02/08/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
02/08/23, 4:13 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Is there a specific format in which the Statement of Purpose is supposed to be done
02/08/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27812646664, we are moving forward to that step only you shall get to know about that now.
02/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
02/08/23, 4:22 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes I'm ready
02/08/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
02/08/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

*1. O-Level Results*

02/08/23, 4:35 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Okay I will submit all that required

03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share your grad 10 results ?
03/08/23, 2:55 pm - +27 74 511 6996: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, indeed you can look for the results today at home, and we would require the final term results for grade 10, and if you are unable to find it at your place then I shall wait for your response once you get an update from the school.
03/08/23, 3:03 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Yes thank you
03/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
04/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you were able to find the Grade 10 results by now?
05/08/23, 6:12 am - +27 74 511 6996: Goodmorning  Ms Kirti, apologies  for this late reply. Unfortunately we haven't managed to get her grade 10 report.
05/08/23, 7:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know if you tried connecting with the school?
05/08/23, 7:38 am - +27 74 511 6996: I will try call the school on monday
05/08/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
05/08/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/08/23, 9:59 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am
05/08/23, 9:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
05/08/23, 9:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
05/08/23, 9:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
05/08/23, 10:00 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am
05/08/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
05/08/23, 10:03 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am I understand
05/08/23, 10:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
05/08/23, 10:28 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am
05/08/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
05/08/23, 10:40 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am I understand
05/08/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
05/08/23, 10:43 am - +27 81 264 6664: No ma'am I don't have questions
05/08/23, 10:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
05/08/23, 10:45 am - +27 81 264 6664: Yes Ma'am. Thank you
05/08/23, 10:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great day and weekend ahead.
05/08/23, 10:54 am - +27 81 264 6664: Thank you ma'am. You too enjoy the rest of the weekend
05/08/23, 10:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you!
08/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, since it was a National Holiday, may I know if you were able to have a conversation with the school regarding Blessing grade 10 results?
16/08/23, 2:57 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Good afternoon, l haven't got any feedback as of yet. The plan is to now drive to the school to get that sorted. I will give you feedback  as to end of business  on Friday if not earlier.
16/08/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I shall wait for your response on Friday. Hope you have a great day ahead.
09/09/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Blessing,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Blessing's higher education?
13/09/23, 10:12 am - +27 74 511 6996: Goodmorning maam
13/09/23, 10:13 am - +27 74 511 6996: We are doing well l hope you doing fine too
19/10/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 5:46 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Hi Ma'am im glad you are feeling better now.
19/10/23, 5:46 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes we can talk now
19/10/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, I am doing well now and I appreciate you waiting patiently for us. Before we start, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level/ Grade 12 Result/Letter of Recommendation/ Final exam date sheet(Grade 12).*

*2. O-Level/ Grade 10 Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
19/10/23, 6:28 pm - +27 81 264 6664: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:28 pm - +27 81 264 6664: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:56 pm - +27 81 264 6664: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your academic documents, it is duly noted with us. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Design (Graphics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 8:04 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes maam
19/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes i remember
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 8:29 pm - +27 81 264 6664: I dont remember much . May you please clarity
19/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 9:19 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes maam
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 9:24 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 9:29 pm - +27 81 264 6664: I don't have questions at the moment
19/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 9:33 pm - +27 81 264 6664: May i discuss the information you have given me with my parents. Then come back to you with the questions that i might have afterwards.
19/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, you can do that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 9:36 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am gald to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Thank you ma'am.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/11/23, 1:37 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Good afternoon ma'am.  I wanted to confirm that we will be available at the proposed time
17/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that. I am looking forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm.
17/11/23, 2:55 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Good afternoon Miss Kirti,thank you fir everything that you have done,but unfortunately Blessing is pulling out of the program.l did communication with her other mentor about the new changes.
17/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, could you please help me understand the same reasons why Blessing no longer wants to continue with the scholarship?
17/11/23, 6:15 pm - +27 74 511 6996: She didn't like the processes she had to go through, like the issue of recruiting other students .l think it put a lot of pressure on her.She got discouraged.
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, I would appreciate if she explained her concerns as well, since many other students have consistently worked on the EWYL projects and we want nothing but the best for her education being her admission officer I would appreciate if you she could share her actually concern with me?
17/11/23, 8:07 pm - +27 81 264 6664: Ma'am i was excited about the program , however  the pressure that i had when i had to submit application forms of other students became to much for me. And it felt like the possibility of me studying in India hinged on the submission of those application forms.
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that however, it is nothing like that please, I will surely have a conversation with your EWYL mentor and the EWYL department head regarding your concern and please do not worry your studies in India is not hinged with just one project EWYL program is an opportunity for you with multiple projects student have been able to earn $300 in a month and are able to cater for their own education without burdening their parents.
18/11/23, 8:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 8:09 am - +27 74 511 6996: Goodmorning, we are connected .
18/11/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now, may I know if you were able to go through this message above?
18/11/23, 8:47 am - +27 74 511 6996: Yes l have gone through that massage.l need you to understand  that we are in Africa,and sending a child so far away has to be done with a clear mind.Any form of discomfort either from me as a parent or my child can be a very big problem.The other issue that was of concern was the Ritual. It was insisted that she says the Ritual and that was a total put off.l honestly don't know what we are getting our selves into but at least can it be done in a manner that does not frighten anybody.
18/11/23, 11:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and acknowledge your concerns I was having a conversation with Blessing's mentor and they mentioned that they have scheduled a call with you I am waiting for feedback from them once I get an update I shall get back to you in the meantime once you are free from the call you can also let me know.
18/11/23, 11:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Also, let me inform you that EWYL is a program that is to develop a student's skill set we discussed yesterday that there is not only one project, there are multiple projects if Blessing is not comfortable working on this project she can inform her mentor about the same. EWYL program is to make your education affordable and to develop your skill set if you do not wish to perform in the EWYL program that is fine as well in the meantime you can focus on your university admission process so that your higher education does not stop and let me clarify once again that your higher education is not linked with your EWYL program your career development is something that is linked  with EWYL.
18/11/23, 11:03 am - +27 74 511 6996: Ok thanks,can we continue with our talk later,l need to get somewhere
18/11/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know a time by when will you be able to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 11:06 am - +27 74 511 6996: Later at 6
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 06:00 pm.

18/11/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you.
20/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, Since it was the weekend, hence we were unable to connect with you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 6:53 am - +27 74 511 6996: Morning  Kirti,yesterday was so exhausted after work,l just couldn't do anything. With regards to our call,l honestly think let's let it pass.l have already started making other arrangements for Blessing's studies in 2014.
21/11/23, 6:54 am - +27 74 511 6996: 2024 l mean
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand that you can get tired after all the work during the day, however, could you help me understand your other plans for the blessings?
21/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 74 511 6996: She is enrolling at another institution for the Graphic course that she always wants to do
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for updating me on Blessing's alternative plans for enrolling in a Graphic course at another institution in 2024. I understand that the decision-making process can be challenging, especially when it involves important life choices such as education abroad. While I have taken note and respect your decision, I must say I am not able to understand the reasons behind such decisions.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Earlier, you mentioned concerns about the EWYL Program, and I have taken steps to address those concerns. Additionally, I have scheduled a call with your mentor to further discuss any apprehensions you may have. But despite our efforts, it's disheartening to see the possibility of you giving up on the pursuit of education abroad, considering the effort and dedication you have invested over the past months.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, I acknowledge that decisions of this nature are personal, and as parents, you have the prerogative to make choices aligned with your family's circumstances. However, as your admission office, since we have invested our time to ensure that you excel in your career, all we can do is once again encourage you to be transparent about the exact concerns because from what I am understanding, withdrawing from your career plans is not a wise choice.
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe that with open communication, we can address any concerns and explore alternatives that align with your aspirations.
21/11/23, 4:07 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Hi Kirti,thank you for your concern about Blessing 's education.As you say,it's not any easy  decision to make to send a child away for school. With this in mind,l have done my own research .We are still continuing with her studies and her future career plan.l want to thank you for working tirelessly with us to help us get her best .
21/11/23, 4:07 pm - +27 74 511 6996: I will also share this with you.When l first  joined your program having to pay the initial payment,can't really remember how much it was,l felt a lot uncomfortable with how is was done.l didn't have money ready  with me to make that initial payment but because my daughter had had one of her friends referring her to the program, l didn't want her to miss out.So l had to do all l could to make sure that money was paid.l was made to write and email requesting to be given time to make payment  and l felt somehow about it.That is  one of the contributing factors to my current decision. I appreciate what has been done so far by your organisation.lt helped me somehow.
21/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that since you mentioned that you did not want her to miss out on this opportunity so may I know why do wish her to miss on this opportunity now, do you not wish to get her higher quality education now?
21/11/23, 6:55 pm - +27 74 511 6996: She is only going to miss out on this one but she got a new one.
21/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am really happy for her, that she now has a new opportunity could you please help me know more about the opportunity?
21/11/23, 6:59 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Like l said she is still doing the same program, which is Graphic Design but not under Edoofa.
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, that is the course that she would be pursuing, however, could you please help me understand the opportunity that she has been offered?
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +27 74 511 6996: Hi Kirti 
I think we have discussed  and spoken enough about Blessing's higher education.Thank you for all you have done and showing interest in her studies.Wishing you the best in your endeavours.
22/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright please, no one will be forcing you, however, I just wanted to know what is the reason for you missing out on this opportunity and if she has a better opportunity than us could you please help me know more about the opportunity?
