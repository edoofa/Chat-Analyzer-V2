18/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes ma'am and I believe we are on stage 4 where we are waiting for offer letters from colleges/ universities
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Thank you soo much
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 241 8378: I have reviewed them let's proceed
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Sorry I was held up with work. This stage is noted
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263782418378 @263718406575?
19/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Good afternoon sorry for the late response I was just finishing up on something we can continue
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I am happy to connect with you again. So may I know if you are clear so far?
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes I think so , so my understanding is that from whatever fee is needed by the college we subtract 150
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let, me help you understand better @263782418378  the registration fee as discussed above is $750 this registration fee through the Endowment program Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf and you will only be required to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the University.
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Also, please understand that this registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes we are
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Please provide me with more information
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes I am clear on this one, thank you
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Right
19/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 241 8378: I agree
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes we are
19/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes maam
19/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Noted maam
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Not yet maam
19/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Blessing's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Blessing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Yes we are awaiting for the next steps
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Thank you so much for your patience.we look forward to hearing from you soon
14/11/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Blessing,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

16/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that it can be a challenging amount to raise, however, please do not worry as we move ahead with our discussion we shall be discussing even how to make education more affordable.
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Ok thank you
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Afternoon we got your message yes and we were still trying to figure out if it would work out for use
17/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 241 8378: Having the accomodation fees reduced is fine but we feel that the tuition fee is very high for a scholarship
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We are doing well ma'am . yes we are .


Ma'am the fees are quite expensive for us . we can not afford it as we are very poor
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718406575 I understand however, as we move ahead with our discussion I would also be explaining you how you can reduce the financial burden as well.
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Oky ma'am
17/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
17/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Yes
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Ydz
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 840 6575: Yes
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We are  .But we cannot pay $750  this is so as my parents only earn $100 per month its too expensive for us ma'am
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
20/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 11:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa changed the group name from "Blessing 2K23JUNE0328" to "Blessing 2K23JUN0328"
21/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
22/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 241 8378: Afternoon I totally understand the purpose of this discussion thought still mantain that for me the average Zimbabwean parent I find the fees to be very high for a scholarship.We had assumed that the fees would be cheaper than here back home. Unfortunately we feel that we have to pull out now as she is not our only child in school we still need to cater for others as well. We are very grateful for your effort to get our daughter educated. Thank you so much
22/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessing.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are trying to say as a parent I understand where you are coming from. However, I would like to know which part of the cost you think is expensive, because the promise that we did the cost range that you were told which is $2000-$3000 the cost of education for blessing is within that rate, including food and accommodation, so I would like to understand, maybe you can hep me with that?
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 840 6575: The fees is expensive
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 840 6575: And so is the accommodation maam
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 840 6575: We can not afford it
22/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, as I remember the counseling sessions you yourself agreed to that fact when we asked you that the cost range of $2000-$3000 is affordable, and blessings annual breakdown comes to $2800 only, so I am unable to understand what part seems expensive to you which you are not able to afford, I belive there is some under lying reason that you are not sharing with me, I would appreciate it you help me understand your challenges openly, I will only be able to help Blessing here if you are transparent with me, please?
