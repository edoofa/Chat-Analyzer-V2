I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>

18/09/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 477 9193: How are you Sir 🙋‍♀️
18/09/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 6:03 am - +263 78 907 8185: Good morning ma'am I think today we can proceed. All this while I was still busy with my exams registration and verifying our CALAs but now the pressure has eased a bit.
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tirivashe.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we can proceed
03/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes that's absolutely correct
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted ma'am but I haven't written my exams yet ...... I'll be starting on the 17th of this month so should I just send the Statement of entry instead
03/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please @263789078185 as mentioned above *Statement of Entry (A-Level)*

03/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted ma'am
03/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So @263789078185 Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Of course..... I think the first step is getting messages from the founders of Edoofa then followed by receiving the statement of purpose. After which I get counseling sessions from universities on admission. After that it's when I'll get the offer letter from the Universities then the acceptance letter. After that is when I start the visa application process. Is that correct
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
03/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 907 8185: So far not yet
03/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
03/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes absolutely ma'am but I'll be writing my exams from the 17th of this month to the 15th of November. So I won't be available during that period. Is that fine
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I understand that and it is completely fine, your parents can be a part of the discussion on your behalf for the time being.
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted, thank you
03/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*. So may I know if you are ready to start?
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we can proceed
03/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
03/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
03/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted with thanks
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
03/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
03/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
03/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes he did
03/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 907 8185: So does that mean we'll pay the $750 when I start my first year in India right
03/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we are
03/10/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
03/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we are ma'am
03/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
03/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Understood but will the 2 weeks deadline still stand since you said it will be adjusted into my first year tuition
03/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Every university has a different deadline period, however, the 2-week deadline will stand still even. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
03/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
03/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted
03/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
03/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
03/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted
03/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 907 8185: So far I understand
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
03/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

10/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 290 3398: May you please proceed & explain these in detail these benefits
10/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tirivashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Noted
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 290 3398: May we please have the total fee we will be charged on admission of our Child Tirivashe
10/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263772903398 we can have a discussion on the cost break down first and then move ahead with the benefits, may I know if you are willing to have a discussion regarding that now?
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tirivashe,

I trust you're in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you but haven't received one yet. Is there something that's been hindering you from replying, considering that you've had the chance to read my message?

11/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Yes
11/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 477 9193: So is the money paid as soon as he gets the offer letter....or we pay towards August next year since that's when he'll be enrolled start at the colleges
11/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Universities I mean
11/10/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774779193 please as we move ahead with our discussion your queries will be answered I encourage you to be patient please.
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Ooh okay Ma'am Thank you I'm very patient.....I will be waiting for your answer
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Noted
11/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Noted
11/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 290 3398: l have noted the requirements needed. We would like to be enlightened if $2800 is the exact figure which needs to be paid?
12/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 290 3398: lf so is this per semester?
12/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you understand, the $2800 is not the per semester fee please, it is the per year tuition fee.
12/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Noted so that's the total cost.Thank you
12/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Good evening Ma'am...can you please help me how many semesters do you have per year here in Zimbabwe we have two per year.
12/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too @263774779193 I am happy to connect with you again, surely let me help you understand, in a year there are two semesters in every university.
12/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Oooh Oky Thank you so much Ma'am for putting me in the picture 👏
12/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Yes
12/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
12/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 477 9193: As for the edofa scholarship I now understand it but I'm not yet aware of the University he is going.
12/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774779193 we will be applying his application to multiple universities so it is impossible for us to share the names of the universities rest assured, when we receive updates from them we will share them with you and I would encourage you to be patient please so that we can move ahead with our discussion and discuss an exciting news that is ahead of the discussion.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Oky Ma'am thank you so much for explaining.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Noted with thanks
12/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Noted Ma'am
12/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to benefits, may I know if you are clear so far as we have discussed two benefits by now, or do you want me explain you again?
12/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Not so sure about the EWYL cause the last time I had he had only $20 so as of now he is busy with the books he is going to continue after exam is it oky.
12/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is completely right, I am sure he is going to be consistent in the EWYL program after his exams. 

Now moving ahead with the 3rd benefit. 

*3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 477 9193: This is good News 👏👏👏 noted
12/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable.

Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that tirivashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Well if there is no further information after this then we can proceed

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
02/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted thank you ma'am ☺️, understood
07/11/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tirivashe,

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?

4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!

Yes, please and I would love to explain your concern in detail as well however, I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
11/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 477 9193: Happy happy Ma'am enjoy your Diwali .
13/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 907 8185: Good morning ma'am
13/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 907 8185: I wanted to ask what happens when we are not able to come up with the registration fee within the required days cause right now the finances aren't looking so good
14/11/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tirivashe.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your warm wishes. It was a great time with my family indeed. I will surely get back to your query at our scheduled time. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to schedule our conversation for 05:00 pm CAT today. I hope you will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me it was our dinner break, however, we can connect now. May I know if you are available to connect now?
14/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we may connect
14/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, coming back to the concern, that you shared above I would like to inform you that the offer letter is issued by the university and the deadline stated as well, if a student is not able to meet the deadline the university shall revoke the offer letter. However, if you keep us informed about your challenges transparently the academic board may consider your reasons and shall provide you an extension if they think that the reason stated is genuine.

I hope we you are clear now?
14/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am we are clear cause as of right now the finances are hard to find ma'am cause we understand it's been about a week since we got the offer letter but we haven't managed to raise the money
14/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, let us discuss the offer letter first so that you will have a better understanding of the letter and then we can move ahead and discuss the financial concerns may I know if you are clear?
14/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes absolutely
14/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
14/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am we can proceed
14/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
14/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 907 8185: 1.$1000
2.4years
3.$300
4.$750
14/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
14/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yeah I understand ma'am but is there a possibility of the scholarship percentage increasing ma'am
14/11/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we discussed earlier, for a student to get a 50% scholarship he/ she will require at least 2E passes. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
14/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear now?
14/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes I think we are clear, so there is a possibility of the scholarship percentage increasing when I get better marks than an E right
14/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
14/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
14/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
14/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted I understand
14/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
14/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yeah it does
14/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
14/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we are
14/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
14/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
14/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes I understand
14/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
14/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes
14/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
14/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
14/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am what happens when we can't meet the deadline
14/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As I mentioned above. The offer letter is issued by the university and the deadline is stated as well by the university, if a student is not able to meet the deadline the university shall revoke the offer letter. However, if you keep us informed about your challenges transparently the academic board may consider your reasons and shall provide you an extension if they think that the reason stated is genuine.

I hope we you are clear now?
15/11/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tirivashe.

I hope you are doing well. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply. I understand that you must be occupied with your work, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am we can proceed.....we apologize for the absence. Our community had a power cut from Tuesday
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I can understand that these problems can be an issue, may I know if you are clear here?
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am we are
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 907 8185: No we are in Bulawayo ma'am
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Understood ma'am but the thing is that we are in Bulawayo and I don't know how we'll get the money to Harare. That's if, if we manage to raise the amount cause to be honest ma'am right now we haven't been able to raise it ma'am 😭😭, I was really looking forward to this but now I don't know how it will happen ma'am 😭
17/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes send ma'am hopefully everything will come together 🤦🏼‍♂️
17/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted thank you
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 290 3398: ls it not safe to deposit into your bank account rather than to pay to an individual in the form of cash.What guarantee do we have that the money will be channeled to you?
17/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan is one of our associates please, Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Noted
17/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Harare to Byo its 440 kms apart.Wont  it be convenient to pay into a given account number?,
17/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please and that is why I shared the above account details, may I know if you were able to go through it?
17/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Or into Mr. Rajan's account since is a respectable business person & very likely to have a bank account for operations
17/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 8:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tirivashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Good evening ma'am....yes we are connected
20/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tirivashe.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to connect with you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes may we can proceed
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes we are ma'am
20/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes absolutely
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 907 8185: Good morning ma'am
21/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 907 8185: I'm sorry I wasn't available
21/11/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents, and Tirivashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since we were unable to have to connect with us yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes ma'am
21/11/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 907 8185: No we can proceed ma'am
21/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Wow this university seems nice 🔥
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it is one of the best universities, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.

21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Yes absolutely ma'am but may I know what happens if we can't make the payment by 22 November.....cause ma'am as we speak right now we haven't raised the required amount as of yet. May I know if it's possible to pay after my results are out.
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789078185 I understand, however, could you please help me understand the challenges that you are going through, due to which you have not been able to raise the first part of the registration fee, maybe you can help me with this?
21/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 907 8185: Well ma'am raising the first part which is the $300 all at once has been a challenge cause my parents need to pay my younger sister's school fees as well and buy groceries for the month so I don't know if there's a way we can raise or pay it bit by bit ma'am.
21/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that completely, it can be a challenge, to raise such an amount when you have responsibilities at home, however, since you were able to communicate with us on time, I am surely going to have a discussion and assist you and see what can be done, before that I would like to know how much have you been able to raise till now and how much will you be able to raise by tomorrow?
21/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 290 3398: Thank you for your response.At the moment we are in a dire situation hence got nothing in our coffers but would be looking forward to raise funds to meet the requirements in the near future.
21/11/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, in that case, may I know what backup plans you have in mind for Tirivashe since you were aware of the registration fee from the month of August?
21/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 290 3398: We were surely aware but we had to attend to an emergency which cleared our coffers.We are looking forward to realize some funds from a project which will yield profits by Feb-March 2024.
21/11/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let us have this discussion tomorrow since it is past our available hours, so let us reconnect tomorrow with a fresh mind I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
