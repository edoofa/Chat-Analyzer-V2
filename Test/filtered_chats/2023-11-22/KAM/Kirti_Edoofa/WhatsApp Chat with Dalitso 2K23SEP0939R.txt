06/10/23, 10:29 pm - +260 97 7878142: Right now in Zambia we are busy doing the integrated national registration information system. So right now I'm in the field shifting teams from one school to the other. Please when you see that I am responding to the messages, it's that it's either I am driving or my bosses are around and I can't be on the phone for a long time
07/10/23, 7:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Dalitso.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your current situation, and I appreciate your efforts to communicate despite your busy schedule. I understand that your profession may not always allow for extended phone conversations. I do look forward to connecting with @260977141566 so that we do not put a pause on Dalitso's process and keep moving ahead and making good progress. With that being said may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/10/23, 7:55 am - +260 97 7878142: Good morning, I am available now. I think my wife will join later
07/10/23, 7:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 8:01 am - +260 97 7878142: Okay I have gone through. There are six stages. Each stage explaining the purpose of it
07/10/23, 8:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
07/10/23, 8:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
07/10/23, 8:13 am - +260 97 7878142: Yes I have clearly understood
07/10/23, 8:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/10/23, 8:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
07/10/23, 8:20 am - +260 97 7878142: Yes I have heard that the counseling will take about an hour, in the event that I break due to the nature of my work, what will happen?
On the fourth step, I have understood that it's the admission board to the documents to various universities and schools depending on the performance
07/10/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, what we can suggest as a solution is that we will inform you one day prior to the counseling discussion so that you can manage your schedule accordingly and take out 1 hour from your day's time I hope this will work as a good solution?
07/10/23, 8:29 am - +260 97 7878142: Yes sir, thank you
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
07/10/23, 8:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
07/10/23, 8:35 am - +260 97 7878142: Yes
07/10/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
07/10/23, 8:40 am - +260 97 7878142: Okay
07/10/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
07/10/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
07/10/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
07/10/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 7878142: Yes you can share. I will be going for work now
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

11/10/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 7878142: Good afternoon sir, sorry for getting back so late. On Saturday in the evening I was involved in an accident, but it was minor. I admitted the same night and I was discharged the following day which was Sunday. On Monday I was still not feeling well. For the videos right now I'm listening to them One by one. The problem is that the presenters are to fast and the voice projection is low I can't hear
11/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear about the accident, but I'm relieved to know it was minor and that you've been discharged. Please prioritize your health and well-being.

I understand that you're experiencing challenges with the videos, particularly the speed and voice projection. In that case, would you like me to share the audio versions of the videos as well?
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes sir
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let me share the audio versions of the videos, please.
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +260 97 7878142: Sir I have listened to them. Should I share them with the teacher of my son in school?
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - +260 97 7878142: I have said so because I want him to understand what is ahead of him
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, could you please share your understanding of the videos as well. Yes, you can do that and it is completely alright the videos are for both parents' and students understanding if the student is not available parents can also go through them.
11/10/23, 1:21 pm - +260 97 7878142: The first video is talking about the importance of enrollment for ever student. There two things in the first video, the should always follow instructions and being open minded
11/10/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 7878142: The second one is talking about the vision of Edoofa. How they help students to better schools depending on the capability of the students
11/10/23, 1:26 pm - +260 97 7878142: The third one is talking about so many schools, colleges and universities which are under Edoofa scholarship. It is also taking about other schools that don't offer international students
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +260 97 7878142: So it's up to the Edoofa board to find the right school For the students
11/10/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 7878142: Good afternoon
11/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @260977878142 I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if we are still connected?
11/10/23, 8:14 pm - +260 97 7878142: Greetings, I thought we had finished the lessons. Is there any thing I need to do after answering the stages of the videos and the theme for the edoofians
11/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No @260977878142, however, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/10/23, 8:37 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes, I earlier said that they are six stages and each stage explaining the of it
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of Dalitso's university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in his admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
11/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

13/10/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation over the personal window @260977878142 I hope you will be able to share the academic documents at least by tomorrow 10:00 am.
16/10/23, 12:10 pm - +260 97 7878142: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 12:10 pm - +260 97 7878142: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dalitso.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation previously may I know if you were able to connect with Dalitso and if you were able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks with his input by now?
17/10/23, 12:16 pm - +260 97 7878142: Good afternoon sir, with regards to that conversation I will be in school where my son is this Friday. I couldn't connect with the boarding master. The reason is some pupils have started practicles so I will be able to share with you when I get there and I make sure that he does that. Thanks
17/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that completely. In that case. I understand that Dalitso will be unable to attend the sessions and complete the assigned tasks due to school commitments. Therefore, we can postpone these tasks for the time being. In the meantime, if you are available, we can proceed with our session. Once he is back home after exams, he can review our conversations, share thoughts, and then complete the SOP form and the tasks. However, to move ahead we would require his academic documents. So does this plan sound acceptable to you?
17/10/23, 12:36 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes, we be sending academic documents tomorrow in afternoon by 14:00hrs
17/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, however, may I know if you are facing any challenges as the parents are able to share the students' documents within the same day I am here saying this because we have delayed the process and do not wish for us to delay the process more please?
17/10/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7878142: You said the grade 10 and grade 12 first term, is it?
17/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please grade 12 end term, or a letter of recommendation will also work if the grade 12 document is not available at the moment.
17/10/23, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7878142: As I told you that I am out of town and out of the province, I have just arrived in choma. I thought my wife had already done that. Please bare with me
17/10/23, 12:55 pm - +260 97 7878142: Letter of recommendation from where? From the church or from school?
17/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that due to work you must be busy and out of town. The letter of recommendation from the school, please.
17/10/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay I will get it from school as I will be going there on Friday
17/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977878142 I appreciate that you are willing to visit the school for the documents, however, please understand that Friday is a long time, the documents are necessary since we would need them so that we can share Dalitso's application with the universities that are going to offer him the scholarship, I hope you understand the importance of the documents here. 

In that case, I would suggest you connect with any of Dalitso's teachers and ask them to share the document picture with you and you can share the same with us, in this way, you will even save your time as well and will not have to travel to the school.

17/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the statement of results, however, we would require a picture of the results please, since these documents will be shared with the university for the scholarship application hence we would require the official documents.
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay I will do that tomorrow
17/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:30 pm.

17/10/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay thanks
17/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:30 pm.
18/10/23, 9:46 am - +260 97 7878142: <Media omitted>

18/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great news, so can I anticipate that you will be able to share the letter by tomorrow 12:30 pm?

18/10/23, 9:07 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
18/10/23, 9:16 pm - +260 97 7878142: I have gone to rest now, I was waiting for you to connect me
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, for not getting back to you, it was a coffee break since it is midnight in India, we here work till late so that we can help you complete the process on time since most of the parents are available during the night. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding now?
19/10/23, 6:09 am - +260 97 7878142: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dalitso.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 7878142: Good afternoon, yes I am available
19/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. *With this, we have put the second step on hold on Dalitso's university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in his admission journey.*
19/10/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay
19/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe he wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology for his higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
19/10/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
19/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
19/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 2:26 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes, he has to choose one from the multiple universities
19/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
19/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 2:44 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes, we are on the same page. May I know how scholarship program is and how the parents have to do for it to be accomplished?
19/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977878142 thank you for your query, and as we move ahead with our discussion your query will be resolved with the detailed discussions.
19/10/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 7878142: Thank you for the update
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay, that means the student should have enough money in his/her account to manage this?
19/10/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 7878142: What about students who are coming from poor background, what happens?
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977878142 no, the parents can send the money when required, and since there is an option to pay in monthly installments it makes the financial concerns better and even easier as for the first part which will be due when Dalitso arrives in India, you as parents have 10 months to cater for that cost, I am sure you will be able to fulfill his dreams with all your hard work.
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay I have understood, I still remember when I had a video call with the director, he mentioned something like the Visa will be done that side. Is it right?
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 7878142: No
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Dalitso, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
23/10/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay
23/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 7878142: Okay
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes I have gotten that
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Dalitso,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 5:06 pm - +260 97 7141566: Good afternoon, we are ready now
25/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
25/10/23, 5:40 pm - +260 97 7878142: Yes
25/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 5:43 pm - +260 97 7878142: What is 2E grades according to the Edoofa scholarship in India
25/10/23, 5:44 pm - +260 97 7878142: Now what happens to the money we have paid?
25/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, it was the grading system for A- level examination for grade 12 a minimum of 2E Grades/ 45% passing marks.
25/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand your question well here, could you please help me understand better?
25/10/23, 5:47 pm - +260 97 7878142: In an event that my son fails to meet your conditions for the scholarship what happens to the money we have paid?
25/10/23, 5:48 pm - +260 97 7878142: Cause already we have paid $350 for enrollment. What happens to this money
25/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to clarify the refund policy: If, for any reason, we as an organization are unable to provide Dalitso an offer letter for higher education, only the $350 Edoofa program fee will be refunded to the parent.
25/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, which you have already paid, the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee, and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
25/10/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.

20/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Dalitso.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you earlier, since it was the weekend, may I know what happened?
20/11/23, 4:22 pm - +260 97 7878142: Good afternoon, my son has lost interest in the Edoofa scholarship program. He told me himself that he doesn't want to continue with the program. That's the reason why I humbly requested for the funds to be refunded before it's too late
20/11/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. However, I would like to know what happened all of a sudden which made him lose interest in the scholarship?
20/11/23, 10:03 pm - +260 763133583: The cost of everything is to much
20/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand which cost are you referring to please?
20/11/23, 10:25 pm - +260 763133583: The funds that you sent cannot be affordable
20/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, and I would love to discuss it with you regarding the same tomorrow at 12:30 pm since our available hours for today are over and it almost 02:00 am here in India.
20/11/23, 10:47 pm - +260 763133583: Alright
22/11/23, 10:34 am - +260 763133583: Morning 
How are you doing?
22/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - +260 763133583: Yes
22/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, coming back to our discussion, you mentioned that the costs can not be affordable, so I would like to understand which part of the cost do you think is not affordable?
22/11/23, 7:50 pm - +260 763133583: The sum of everything
22/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are trying to say. I understand where you are coming from. However, I would like to know which part of the cost you think is expensive, because the promise that the cost range that you were told which is $2000-$3000 the cost of education for you will be within that range, including food and accommodation, so I would like to understand, maybe you can help me with that?
22/11/23, 8:47 pm - +260 763133583: If the cost of everything be like $750 will affordable on my concern
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260763133583 $750 is just a registration fee which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
22/11/23, 9:16 pm - +260 763133583: I know about that, now when you add everything up it's making it costing
