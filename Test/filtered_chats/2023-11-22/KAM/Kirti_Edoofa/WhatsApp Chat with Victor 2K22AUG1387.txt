17/10/23, 8:23 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I do remember the discussion
17/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 8:27 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Sorry but I didn't go into details I only read the process maybe you can remind me please
17/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help you recall the steps. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
17/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you have any questions please feel free to ask?
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: What about the remaining stages
17/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We shall cover them now @265983542833 so may I know if you have any queries so far?
17/10/23, 9:24 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I am good no
17/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
18/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Victor.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, you did not respond, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/10/23, 1:14 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Yes I am available now
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I was cool with process 1 and 2 .so you can continue with process 3
18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I totally agree with you
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
18/10/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: So you are trying to say that once I receive the letter from various university I can then pay for the fee or i have to pay before receiving the letter
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Ooh it's okay I understand sorry
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please once you receive the offer letter then would have to pay the registration fee to reserve your seat with the university.
18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 2:26 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I am not clear can you explain it in simple way please
18/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, Victor, you are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $300 and this all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope you are clear till here?
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265983542833 could you please help me understand your queries so that I can help you have better clarity?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Victor.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @265983542833 @265881203245?
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I am now available we can proceed with our discussion
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: No questions we can proceed
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Yes I am very excited
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 1:07 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Thank you so much for making me understand all the process and I can't wait to receive the letter .thank you have a blessed day
07/11/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Victor,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
07/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 04:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
07/11/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 04:30 PM to 07:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for acknowledging the message. I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 10:00 a.m.
09/11/23, 8:28 am - +265 983 54 28 33: Noted
09/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings with regards to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/11/23, 10:14 am - +265 881 20 32 45: Yes,  am available

09/11/23, 10:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

09/11/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
09/11/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
09/11/23, 10:38 am - +265 983 54 28 33: The tuition fee per semester is 2000USD,the standard duration or the course is 4 years ( 8semesters),the admission and procedure fee is 300USD
09/11/23, 10:41 am - +265 983 54 28 33: Registration fee is 750 USD
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses, however, for question 1 could you please share the response to question 1 which is the tuition fee after the scholarship?
09/11/23, 10:52 am - +265 983 54 28 33: 1000USD
09/11/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
09/11/23, 10:57 am - +265 983 54 28 33: It's clear
09/11/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
09/11/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/11/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/11/23, 11:01 am - +265 983 54 28 33: So the $2000 it's for accommodation and food ??
09/11/23, 11:02 am - +265 983 54 28 33: It's oky I am clear now
09/11/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
09/11/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
09/11/23, 11:08 am - +265 983 54 28 33: Yes it's clear
09/11/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
09/11/23, 11:11 am - +265 983 54 28 33: Yes I am clear we can move on
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
09/11/23, 11:14 am - +265 983 54 28 33: Oky clear
09/11/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
09/11/23, 12:04 pm - +265 881 20 32 45: Yes , explain more on this
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/11/23, 12:08 pm - +265 881 20 32 45: Its clear.
09/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/11/23, 12:18 pm - +265 881 20 32 45: We are in Malawi not zimbambwe
09/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the correction. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
09/11/23, 12:25 pm - +265 881 20 32 45: Yes, I think it will be done as we did with that first payment?
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
09/11/23, 12:31 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Oky clear
09/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
09/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
09/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
09/11/23, 12:33 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Yes it's very clear
09/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/11/23, 12:38 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: That's good to hear
09/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
09/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/11/23, 12:41 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Oky noted
09/11/23, 12:41 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: I am clear you can continue
09/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear so far. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 14th of November which is Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
09/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 983 54 28 33: Sounds good

The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
