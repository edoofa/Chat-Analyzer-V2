For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 3:40 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes pliz
01/08/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 3:44 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I go through ,can you pliz explain
01/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 3:50 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes there are cler
01/08/23, 3:50 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Clear
01/08/23, 3:50 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Thank you
01/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 3:52 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I'm following
01/08/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 4:44 pm - +27 62 721 8926: For the 500 -750 you want us to pay for how long coz its too much for me to pay it once
01/08/23, 4:45 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes it is clear
01/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 9:53 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Sorry for late respond
01/08/23, 9:53 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Busy at work
01/08/23, 9:53 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes we can proceed
01/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

02/08/23, 9:56 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I go through
02/08/23, 9:56 pm - +27 62 721 8926: How are you

03/08/23, 8:20 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Statement of purpose helps with the Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions ,Seels Learning Centre classes etc.Then from Edoofa you can access all these services for your education abroad for only 500 -750 $ enrollment fee
03/08/23, 8:20 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Hello sorry for late respond
03/08/23, 8:21 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Busy at work
03/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 8:24 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky thanks
03/08/23, 8:25 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I just want to ask as Anotidaishe 's mother

03/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27627218926, thank you for sharing that with me, however, Regarding the course, I would like to let you know that our career counselors here at Edoofa analyze the student's academic background first and then recommend the course, so please be assured about the course as for to have a career in BA. LLB. 

I would encourage you to not involve yourself in self-research as it will complicate your understanding more.
03/08/23, 9:21 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky its fine
03/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
03/08/23, 10:00 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky
03/08/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1.

I hope you are doing well, yes I did earlier, but since you want me to share them again, I shall share the academic interview questions again with you.
09/08/23, 10:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

09/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 077 5457 was added
09/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if we are still connected or not?
09/08/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Good evening  i am sorry for failing to give the response on time my school time table was very busy today but now  I am still working on the issue but I promise by tomorrow I will submit
09/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 077 5457: For now I am through with question 2 and 3
10/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 077 5457: 2. Firstly I would like to define the term rights as claims of an individual that are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by the society or the state whilst duty is something that someone is expected to do. I will further define rights as principles of legal,social or ethical freedom to which individuals are entitled by a governing entity whilst on the other hand duty refers to responsibilities or obligations of an individual imposed by the governing body on the said individual.

Also the difference between the civil and human rights is that civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a particular country and these rights protect individuals from discrimination based on race,sex and other characteristics. An example of civil right is right to vote, freedom of religion and to public education. Whilst human right are the rights which people have simply by virtue of their humanity regardless of one's citizen status  and also human rights are applicable to all human beings regardless of their identify for example the right to live 

3.Again in this academic piece I would like to define the term prosecutor as the legal representative of the prosecution in states with either the common law inquisitorial system and I also define an attorney as one who acts as a practitioner in a court of law.


4. I am mostly interested in pursuing civil law because through my research I have found out that there are two types of law namely criminal and civil law. To me civil law is the best as it caters for the lawsuits brought by individuals or the government against other individuals and this will help me in bringing justice in the community hence ensuring peace amongst people in the community.Through civil law I will be able to pursue my ambitions free from the constrains of oppression and tranny as a result I will be able to know what is right and what is wrong without being manipulated by others as I will be knowing my rights. Lastly I will be in a position to defend everyone from the roots of oppression by the  tyrant and oppressive leaders hence ensuring a justice and liveable society.



5. I have many skills that I can assure myself of being a successful lawyer. Firstly I am good at information analysis and research. During my spare time I usually take my time on researching as I know research is one of the skill that I need for me to pursue my course. Through research skill I was able to know that a good lawyer should be able to read large documents or long news articles and be able to construct important point within the article, as this will make me a successful lawyer. Also I have good communication skills which is evidenced by the debate and public speaking groups which I participate at my school this helped me in the sense that it made me a confident speaker which is one of the skill needed for a lawyer. Again I also have a skill of creative problem solving this  is evidenced by the fact that I am a leader at my school, I know that I should be able to think outside the box especially on solving the issues and cases at school and through this skill I was always successful also I have some skills such as teamwork and organisation thus through all the information I view myself as a successful lawyer one day.

Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 3:47 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes he did
16/08/23, 3:49 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I understand
16/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I understand
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky i understand
16/08/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 5:40 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I understand
16/08/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 8:04 pm - +27 62 721 8926: No I don't have any queries
16/08/23, 8:05 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I understand stand what you said thank you
16/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have no queries, Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 8:12 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Okythanks
16/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

21/10/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:48 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am
21/10/23, 10:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?

21/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 11:04 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky maam
21/10/23, 11:05 am - +27 62 721 8926: I just want to ask how I pay the amount coz to pay 500 to 750 $ once payment its more money for me
21/10/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern here, however, as we move forward with our discussion your query shall be answered, please do not worry.
21/10/23, 11:08 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am thank you
21/10/23, 11:09 am - +27 62 721 8926: We can continue with our discussion
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 11:12 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am I understand
21/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 11:16 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am we understand
21/10/23, 11:16 am - +27 62 721 8926: Lets continue
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Anotidaishe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 11:21 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am I understand
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:23 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes maam
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:29 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I understand ma'am
21/10/23, 11:29 am - +27 62 721 8926: Thank you
21/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 11:33 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am ,no ma'am
21/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 11:37 am - +27 62 721 8926: Pliz provide with more information
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
21/10/23, 11:43 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I understand
21/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/10/23, 11:44 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes maam
21/10/23, 11:44 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand
21/10/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/10/23, 11:46 am - +27 62 721 8926: I agree with number 2
21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/10/23, 12:04 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I'm clear but I think we will prefer number 2 pursue a diplomavoursw first and then continue with your bachelor's degree
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/10/23, 12:06 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky maam
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 12:10 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand ma'am
21/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I would like to know my costs
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what costs are you referring to since the cost was discussed in June, however, if you want me to reiterate it I can surely do that?
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I think you can do that for me pliz
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Sorry ma'am
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes you can proceed
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes now I understand that
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
21/10/23, 1:17 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes I understand
21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 1:21 pm - +27 62 721 8926: It's fine ma'am we understand
21/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Anotidaishe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes maam
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter, once you share the documents with us we will be able to share the application with the universities so that we can share with the universities. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +27 62 721 8926: 1.$900 per semester
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +27 62 721 8926: 2.5years

16/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky Maam can you pliz explain to me,

16/11/23, 8:57 pm - +27 62 721 8926: You mean only campus accommodation is $2000 to $2500
16/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting.

18/11/23, 8:13 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes pliz
18/11/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better now, coming back to your concern from the other day, I would like to share that there is not only on- campus accommodation.  if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 10:01 am - +27 62 721 8926: I would prefer staying off campus
18/11/23, 10:01 am - +27 62 721 8926: Cause I see its much cheaper
18/11/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 10:26 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am
18/11/23, 10:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 10:27 am - +27 62 721 8926: So you mean they only want him to stay at the campus
18/11/23, 10:27 am - +27 62 721 8926: That one is fine ma'am
18/11/23, 10:27 am - +27 62 721 8926: I understand
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: No please, Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.
18/11/23, 10:31 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am
18/11/23, 10:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 10:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 10:33 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky thank you ma'am
18/11/23, 10:34 am - +27 62 721 8926: That's my problem ma'am for now I don't have the money

18/11/23, 10:35 am - +27 62 721 8926: Now I don't know how you can help me pliz
18/11/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 10:37 am - +27 62 721 8926: Yes pliz
18/11/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 10:44 am - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand ma'am
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 11:38 am - +27 62 721 8926: In Midlands
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Right now I'm based in South Africa
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I don't think will be able to meet the due date
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 62 721 8926: 28 November
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Maam
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Coz right now I don't have the money
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, and please be assured we will be discussing your concern in detail please do not worry, let us complete our letter discussion first so that you can have a better understanding of the letter.
18/11/23, 12:13 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky maam
18/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.  Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes pliz
18/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/11/23, 12:30 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky thank you
18/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
18/11/23, 12:37 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky thank you
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 12:47 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes thank you
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 1:47 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky I understand
18/11/23, 1:48 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Nextweek I will call Anotidashe so that you can start the EWYL with him
18/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that he will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 62 721 8926: My worries is I don't have the moneny now maam
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I'm not permanently employed
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 62 721 8926: And the due date is 28
18/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I have taken note of that concern, apart from that I would like to inquire if you have any concerns?
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Oky ma'am thank
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

21/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with your concern, for now, your focus is to register yourself with the university, by paying the registration fee of $600 since $150 is covered by Edoofa for you. May I know if you are clear so far?
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 501 9780: Its not clear because for now we don't have that amount of money so is there any other way
21/11/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I understand, this $600 can be paid in two installments of $300 each, as per the deadlines shared by the university, which are:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 501 9780: So after this amount have being paid are we supposed to pay another amount of money or
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please this is the registration fee, during our discussion above we have shared the annual fee breakup with you as well, may i know if you want me share the same with you again?
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 501 9780: Not really but we are worried about the total amount which we should pay because its too much and my parents cannot afford it
21/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, I completely understand the concern that you are sharing with me, however, may I know what part of the education do you think is not affordable for you since the cost is exactly within the range of $2000-$3000 which was informed to you by your counselors?
21/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 501 9780: Oky for that I know so I am going to pay 50%  of that amount right
21/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let us have this discussion tomorrow since it is past our available hours, so let us reconnect tomorrow with a fresh mind I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
