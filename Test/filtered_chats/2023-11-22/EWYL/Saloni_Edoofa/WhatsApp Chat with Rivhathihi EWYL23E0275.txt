I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
17/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 252 6859: Good evening. 
We are doing fine here.
17/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 252 6859: Since Rivhathihi oir daughter is currently at school,we as parents can complete those inial sessions.
19/09/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
19/09/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great!
20/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 252 6859: Noted

20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
20/09/23, 3:02 pm - +264 81 350 0785: True.
20/09/23, 3:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired! <This message was edited>

20/09/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 252 6859: Students learn and develop job skills and get the opportunity to earn scholarship credit.
27/09/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Rivhathihi will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
04/10/23, 10:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 252 6859: Good morning

11/10/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Rivhathihi can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 252 6859: Yes we are on the same page.
11/10/23, 10:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
11/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 252 6859: Since the student is preparing for her fnal exams and she will be through in mid Nov.We would prefer her to resume the programme as soon as she is done with her A level examinatons.
11/10/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Rivhathihi takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned regarding the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Rivhathihi is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
11/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 252 6859: Its okay.So lets wait for her coming in mid November.
11/10/23, 11:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: But like I said these are some basic formalities that need to be completed.
11/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 252 6859: Sorry l think l had musunderstood you.lm fyn with doing the formalities as we wait for Rivhathihi.
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/10/23, 11:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/10/23, 1:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read it.

17/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 252 6859: I am a proud Edofian.
17/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 252 6859: My thought about Henry Ford's view on that it is wise to provide value before seeking it.l so much agree with that view for the following reasons:
You get what you put in hence its wiae to provede first then you will yield results.Providing value first will help your copmany to win approval and acceptance of customers  that is provided the value provided is satisfactory bearing in mind thatcustomers have higher expectations which shoyld be fulfilled by a company.
Before an organisation provides value,it has to consider that value begets value.
17/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 252 6859: By providing value before seeking value l envision an increase in customer satisfaction  and a reduction in customer comolaints.At the end of the day my customers will be motivated to continue engaging with my company brand.This loyal relationship with my company brand will eventually lead to an increase in reputation which will further result in profits and long term success of my company.

27/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 252 6859: The similarities in these two places in terms of the festivals held is that their festivals reflect beliefs,hopes,traditions,culture and spirituality hence 
the importance of moral value is emphasised.Ceremonies from both places help to show that people are united and they bring a sense of belonging.
They stimulate us and motivate our emotions.Also most of these ceremonies include music,dance,drama and visual arts.
01/11/23, 9:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, esteemed and proud Edoofians parents!

At Edoofa, we ensure that our students are well-prepared for what lies ahead, and we open the doors to a world of exclusive opportunities for them. The response from our amazing students has been nothing short of overwhelming, and I am bursting with pride to be their mentor👏🏼

Take a look at this remarkable journey, and imagine how you'd like your own orientation program to be. Just picture the excitement of meeting me, your mentor, in person!
*What would your dream orientation program look like?*

Hope you are doing well.

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
