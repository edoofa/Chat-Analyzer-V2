Ewyl programme will give an important hand for me to archieve my goals as through this I will be able to get money which will help me and my parents in financing my university fee as a result I will be able to complete my university level...as ewyl will help interms of finance

22/08/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright.
22/08/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 077 5457: No what are our keys
22/08/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/08/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Okay thank you now I understand
22/08/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/08/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Yea I have read it
22/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Okay thank you nice to know them
22/08/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, they are also honored to have you.
22/08/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your allotted time slot.
Have a wonderful day ahead.
22/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Thank you and same to you
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me for the delay in the session as I was caught up in a meeting.
So now are you ready for your session.
23/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Yes I am ready we can proceed
23/08/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Yes
23/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 077 5457: I have finished reading the first newsletter yet....for the second it's still downloading
23/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 077 5457: my WhatsApp network is not doing good
23/08/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay understandable.
23/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session.
So we will meet tomorrow at the same time.
Have a good day.
23/08/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Thank you

24/08/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 077 5457: It's difficult for me to draw the line on which section was the best for me. As each section was interesting and I learnt a lot from both newsletters
24/08/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Student!
It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.

24/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/08/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
24/08/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 077 5457: Yes
25/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 077 5457: My cellphone's mobile network is very low these days
25/08/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay I understand but please try to have a stable network at least during your session timings.
25/08/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨

Hope you are well.
16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Anotidaishe!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

21/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Anotidaishe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss the EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share the challenges and the things one is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - +27 62 721 8926: Yes we are on the same
21/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

21/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Anotidaishe has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where he learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After that, he was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
21/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, he will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help him to fund his higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help to build his personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
21/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
21/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
21/09/23, 3:06 pm - +27 62 721 8926: I understand ma'am no queries
21/09/23, 3:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today.
