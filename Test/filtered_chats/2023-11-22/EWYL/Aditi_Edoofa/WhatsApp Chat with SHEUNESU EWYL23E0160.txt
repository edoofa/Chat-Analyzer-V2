Hope you are well.
I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸 <This message was edited>

09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Thursday!
I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
09/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 152 8669: Thank you so much!
09/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 152 8669: I'm very sorry, I'm traveling to the village because I'm not feeling well so l can't  light a candle while traveling and with you my picture
09/11/23, 10:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright you can send it anytime before 14th November I hope you would be able to manage that?
09/11/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 152 8669: Yes I will
09/11/23, 10:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
14/11/23, 10:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well

I hope you enjoyed your Diwali break, may I know what you learned about Diwali's significance also do share the picture of the activity with me on the EWYL Line.🤩
15/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I trust this message finds you in high spirits! 😊 I wanted to touch base regarding our missed session on Monday, and I hope you had a fantastic Diwali break.

Given the festive spirit, it seems our schedules got a bit tangled. No worries at all! How about we reschedule our session today between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM? 
Looking forward to connecting and picking up where we left off!
16/11/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good day @263771528669 @26774600373 !
I hope you're doing well.

Please keep in mind to stick to your daily schedule on the EWYL Line for an excellent session. I'm optimistic that there won't be a necessity for frequent prompts from me.
16/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 152 8669: I'm fine let me do so
16/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 152 8669: I didn't manage to take the picture because I'm still at the village
16/11/23, 10:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: I understand!
20/11/23, 11:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day Sheunesu!
Hope you are well.

I'm quite disappointed that you weren't able to make our planned session today. I was eagerly waiting for you on the EWYL Line.
21/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 152 8669: Good morning Ms Aditi. I'm very sorry for that. There is no network at the village. Another problem is that there is no power to charge my phone
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand Sheunesu, but these sessions are crucial so make sure that your EWYL Journey is smooth.
22/11/23, 7:50 am - +263 77 152 8669: It's alright Ms Aditi. Otherwise good morning!
22/11/23, 8:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @263771528669 
Hope you are well.

I realize that your work commitments are making it challenging for you to attend sessions regularly. To find a middle-ground, how about maintaining the daily routine by joining sessions and completing Wednesday lessons and Saturday activities in the evening when you have time?
Additionally, it would be great if you could provide regular updates on the project, even if there's no significant progress. Consistent communication is key, and your updates will be valuable.
22/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 152 8669: Yes l think we can do it in the evening. I will be available and my phone charge during the day so this makes me present in the evening
22/11/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic! Just a heads-up, I won't be available in the evening. I'd really appreciate your patience, and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm back online. Thanks!
22/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 152 8669: Ok l will
22/11/23, 10:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
