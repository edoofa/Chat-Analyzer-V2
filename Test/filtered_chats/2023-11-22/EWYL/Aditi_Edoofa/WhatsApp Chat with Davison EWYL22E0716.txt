15/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
15/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
15/09/23, 2:50 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay
15/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
15/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

20/09/23, 3:02 pm - +91 79019 10847: Understood ma'am
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay ma'am I will be in touch again tomorrow

22/09/23, 2:25 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay for now I don't have any relevant questions to ask , perhaps if something arises I will come forward
22/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
22/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
22/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
22/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
22/09/23, 2:31 pm - +91 79019 10847: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - +91 79019 10847: Understood ma'am
22/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
22/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 79019 10847: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So can you please brief me about your understanding of these terms.
22/09/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Davison, before beginning I would like your response on this.
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay ma'am as per the terms mentioned above I have only came across a few such as research , content writing , digital marketing and blog writing only
25/09/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here is a brief about  all of these terms for your better understanding:

Research: Thorough research forms the foundation of our work, ensuring accuracy and credibility in every piece of content we produce.

Content Writing: Our team excels in crafting engaging and informative content that resonates with our target audience, conveying our messages effectively.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Implementing effective SEO strategies ensures that our content reaches a wider online audience, improving visibility and engagement.

Digital Marketing: Through strategic digital marketing initiatives, we're expanding our reach and creating meaningful connections with our audience across various online platforms.

Creative Content: We're committed to delivering content that stands out – creative, original, and valuable, leaving a lasting impact on our audience.

Influencer Marketing: Collaborating with influencers allows us to tap into their engaged followers, enhancing our brand's credibility and outreach.

Social Media Engagement: Actively engaging on social media platforms fosters a sense of community, encourages conversations, and keeps our audience connected.

Blog Writing: Our blogs serve as a platform to share in-depth insights, industry trends, and valuable information that our readers find valuable.
25/09/23, 2:20 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay understood ma'am
25/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
25/09/23, 2:32 pm - +91 79019 10847: Understood
25/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
25/09/23, 2:41 pm - +91 79019 10847: No I don't have but I will create one
25/09/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
25/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
25/09/23, 2:48 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay understood ma'am
25/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
So Davison we have officially completed our Initial Sessions and I hope everything is clear with you, now we will connect on call for your project updates, alright?
25/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 79019 10847: Okay
25/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
Have a good day ahead!

19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you, my student💯. Here are the pointers for your help.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 6:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
