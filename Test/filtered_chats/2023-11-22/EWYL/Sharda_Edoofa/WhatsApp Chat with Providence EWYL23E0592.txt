Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
08/11/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.
