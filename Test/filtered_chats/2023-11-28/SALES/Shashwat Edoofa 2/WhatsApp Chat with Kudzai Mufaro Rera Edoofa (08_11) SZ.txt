2 .Its a challenging field which is male dominated but i have developed a strong interest in building making something from nothing to some beautiful super structure
15/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 017 1967: Ok that's alright
15/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Kudzai. While your experience in your parents' business and your interest in civil engineering are undoubtedly valuable, consider the vast opportunities and dynamic challenges presented by a degree in Business. It provides a comprehensive understanding of business principles, management strategies, and financial acumen, which are universally applicable skills. It offers a unique blend of entrepreneurship and managerial insights, enabling you to not only create but also successfully manage and grow businesses.

The skills acquired in business, coupled with your passion for building and creating, can uniquely position you to lead and innovate in the business world.

May I know whether you find that fascinating, please?
