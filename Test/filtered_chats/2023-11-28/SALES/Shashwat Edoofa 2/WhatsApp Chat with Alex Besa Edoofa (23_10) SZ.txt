31/10/23, 8:36 am - +260 777710645: Good morning
31/10/23, 8:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A delightful morning to you, Alex! Have you had the opportunity to have a conversation with your parents regarding the application?
31/10/23, 8:50 am - +260 777710645: We have interacted about it on most occasions
31/10/23, 8:50 am - +260 777710645: But they would like to have more detail about it
31/10/23, 8:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Alex. I want to bring to your attention that your father has expressed his lack of awareness regarding the application and has mentioned his intention to close it until he feels interested. Additionally, he conveyed his willingness to block me should I persist in our interaction. This comes as a surprise, especially considering Felix's positive perspective on your application. I kindly request you to engage in a comprehensive discussion with him to gain his perspective, and once the entire family, including the child and parents, is aligned with the application, we can proceed with the session.
31/10/23, 8:55 am - +260 777710645: Not a problem at all
31/10/23, 8:55 am - +260 777710645: I shall get to it
31/10/23, 8:56 am - +260 777710645: Apologies for the inconvenience he may have caused
31/10/23, 8:56 am - +260 777710645: But I’ll change his perspective
31/10/23, 8:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Alex. I truly appreciate your sincerity and diligence! I will be waiting for your response.
31/10/23, 9:06 am - +260 777710645: Does the scholarship cover aviation ?
31/10/23, 9:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Alex. If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not flight tickets because the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe once or twice, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So, they learn and do internships during breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
(air fare :-around $400) is to be borne by the student which is mostly a one time investment.
31/10/23, 10:05 am - +260 777710645: Oh okay
31/10/23, 10:06 am - +260 777710645: What courses are offered ?
31/10/23, 10:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Alex. There is a wide range of courses available, each designed to cater to a student's unique career aspirations. The most suitable course can be determined during the counseling session, where we can explore the best options together. May I know whether your parents are onboard with the application process, please?
31/10/23, 8:52 pm - +260 97 7624980 was added

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
27/11/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hi Alex, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Monday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
