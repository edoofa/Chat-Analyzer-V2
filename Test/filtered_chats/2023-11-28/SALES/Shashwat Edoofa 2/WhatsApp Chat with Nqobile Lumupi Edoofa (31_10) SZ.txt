01/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Nqobile. Can you please brief me regarding the professions that your parents indulge in?

01/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Nqobile. May I know whether you are financially prepared to commence your education now, please?
01/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 770 0300: No thats why I applied l thought you will assist l didnt know there is payment needed
01/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate the message, Nqobile?
01/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 770 0300: I am not prepared financial l was thinking Edoofa Schoolarship program helps free off charge
01/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nqobile. May I know what is your understanding of the term "free off charge", please?
01/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 770 0300: As in you help free no payment needed
01/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
01/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 770 0300: Noted now  l understand
01/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 770 0300: So how much does your program offer
01/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message.
01/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 770 0300: Done thank you
01/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please answer this question again, Nqobile?

02/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 770 0300: Can l have list of courses done at your listed universities

However, the primary objective of this counseling session is to identify and recommend a course that aligns perfectly with the student's unique career aspirations and goals.

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
27/11/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hi Nqobile, I hope you are in good health.

Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Monday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*
