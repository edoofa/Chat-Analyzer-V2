23/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 235 4301: My father

*"Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." – Winston Churchill*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
24/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm ready
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Michelle!
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Michelle. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share your previous term results in a textual format?
24/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I don't remember my exact scores but l got zero points from all the 4 subjects
24/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
24/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Nope. I just did not study hard enough
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
24/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I am confident
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colors, Michelle! Can you please brief me regarding your A-Level subject combination? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I'm doing Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Statistics
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 235 4301: What kind of documents
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I want to be a gynecologist
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your previous term results, Michelle.
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Oky l will
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I just want to help women to maintain their reproductive health and to make sure they have  access to quality care. I also want to help women to feel comfortable and supported during sensitive and personal appointments.
24/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your dedication to supporting and advocating for women's reproductive health is truly commendable. The fact that you aspire to ensure women have access to quality care while also prioritizing their comfort and emotional well-being during sensitive appointments reflects a deep sense of compassion and understanding, Michelle! Could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes it is very crucial and l also didn't understand it when l was doing my O level
24/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 235 4301: That's why l did not pursue it.
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 235 4301: So l have to study Physics too?
24/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Michelle Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Bachelor of science in optometry
24/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what do you find fascinating about that domain, please?
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Learning more about eyes
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bachelor of Science in Optometry
*Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Thank you for the information
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yeah l think it does
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have any other course in mind, please?

24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
24/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 235 4301: The science field captivates me the most and my interests came from the fact that my father was also science student but he did not get the chance to study further so he is giving me the opportunity to study and become a doctor not that I'm doing it for the fact he did not become one bt for my love of sciences as l am a very curious person just like him.
24/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You mentioned your affinity for the Science field. Since Science encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
24/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Biology
24/11/23, 10:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

*B.Sc Microbiology*
*B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
27/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
27/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Sc Microbiology
*B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
