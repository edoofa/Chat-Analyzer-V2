23/11/23, 5:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Commencing the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Fanwell ?*
23/11/23, 8:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:32 pm - +27 67 752 2982: I would really appreciate if you shift the hours to 6pm
23/11/23, 9:36 pm - +27 67 752 2982: I would love to proceed with my education but had no fundings. So a friend of mine introduced me to this program and he left for India last month which even motivated me more thus i decided to partake in it and sent my application because i could really see my self embark on this journey with Edoofah. And im super glad I’m here today. It has always been my passion to study abroad due to lack of resources in Zimbabwe so being enrolled at an international university brings about a broad foundation in terms of learning and adapting to  new environments which is a life changing experience especially with Edoofa. 
During our discussion with my friend regarding Edoofa i  fell in love with the motto.. which says”Education for all”. The sole mission being to provide affordable scholarships to students around the world in pursuing their dreams as well as helping students in acquiring employability skills and internship opportunities. It gets students admitted into some of the most qualified and best universities for their program and ensures that they are able to get skilled and employable through a well structured practical training. Imagine going straight to work after graduating groomed and ripened…isn’t it an honor. If we look at the world today graduates bright students are staying at home because they can not find employment. This is really an unfortunate situation and Edoofa has given especially me,the motivation and zeal to persue in its program to provide affordable and accessible education leading to employment thus cutting down unemployment in the world at large.
  Not just that what makes it more mind-blowing is that students are given the chance to earn scholarship credits which enables them to reduce their tuition fees through their earn while you learn program whereby students are engaged in part-time online projects which helps build their experience by working online.
Aside from the skills student are acquiring from their various universities they also make sure students acquire the skills to be more professional and qualified for any job employment.
I’m really grateful to be here part n parcel of Edoofa.
