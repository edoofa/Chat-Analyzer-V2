27/11/23, 5:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
27/11/23, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

27/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 333 9437: Yes l am
27/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 333 9437: No l haven't apply to any University abroad
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 333 9437: Thank for such  good information l appreciate
27/11/23, 8:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Zvikomborero, Kindly excuse for the delay, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue


*Bachelor of Business Administration or BBA* 



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
27/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 333 9437: Yes you can
28/11/23, 12:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT on (28/11/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation.

In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session
