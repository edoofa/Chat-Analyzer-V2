Edoofa is a good  scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions PvtLtd ,in india Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through that scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, it solves problems of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education😌.Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready and that is a very rare opportunity🤭
22/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 641 9344: Woww👏🏼

23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this.
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.
