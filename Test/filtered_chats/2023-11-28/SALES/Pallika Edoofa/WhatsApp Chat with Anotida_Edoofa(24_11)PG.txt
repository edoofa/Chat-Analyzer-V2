Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session.
