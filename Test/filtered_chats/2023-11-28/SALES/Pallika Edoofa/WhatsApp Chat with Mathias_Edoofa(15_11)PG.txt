23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mathias, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 506 8691: Yes sure
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!

23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 506 8691: Ok I will send it tomorrow
23/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 506 8691: No didn't
