So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn so far?
21/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 462 6415: So when the agents of the program came. They were in a rush so they asked us to fill in the forms to get a scholarship to India. They didn't say much they said you will be contacted and  know what's its all about.
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: They were not the agents please, they were Senior Academicians here at Edoofa,

So, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
21/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 462 6415: Thank you for the correction. And also the information about the scholarship program
21/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 324 5970: Thank you for this information. As a parent am grateful for this wonderful work that you are doing for our children in Africa and elsewhere.
21/10/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You're welcome please
21/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Dr Amos.
21/10/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tatenda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
21/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 462 6415: My self and education
I was born on the 14th of March 2005, right now I am 18. So currently I am studying at St Ignatius College a Jeseuit Catholic school. At the college I am the deputy head boy, the LEO(leadership experience opportunity) club vice president, the darts captain, a magazine club member and also I play basketball. In terms of academics, I do Design and Technology, mathematics, computer science. And as an additional subject I am doing Cad (computer aided design) which is being sponsored by autodesk and ADC. Recently in September I won best in subjects in two subjects, which are Design and technology and computer science. And was number one in the commercials class. I choose this combination because I want to persue Architecture as a profession. I really love architecture and also I think I would be really good at it. Its the one of the professions I see myself making a big impact in people's lives
21/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 462 6415: As for my hobbies I like gardening and also find peace in taking pictures just for fun.
21/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 462 6415: As for my strengths I think I am good with handling people and also time conscious and a man of principles. And some how I always find myself in tangled with leadership. Since primary level I was aways involved in student leadership. As for my weakness I think communicating is one of the problems, but I have been working on it. I can do prepared speeches but doing sort of an impromt is hard for me. I lose confidence. And I forget to mention that I am doing Cambridge As and A-level.
21/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 462 6415: As for my family I am the second born out of three. And the only boy.
21/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 462 6415: As for the family background and parents details I think my father can expagorate
21/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 324 5970: Thank you. Tatenda is the only son of Amos Munzara and Mollen Munzara (mother). Besides Tatenda, there are two girls Tanaka and  Makanaka.  Tanaka is doing first year at University and Makanaka is in grade 6. As for work, we are employed as civil servants by the government of Zimbabwe, myself as a senior lecturer at the Zimbabwe Open University and Mollen as an HR officer in the Ministry of Education. Given the economic hardships in our country, we are not earning much and we are struggling to pay fees for all our children.
21/10/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tatenda, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

You surely seem to be a hardworking and dedicated student who has great leadership skills.
21/10/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Well received Dr Amos, Its a pleasure to know about you 

You surely seem to be leading a family that greatly values education.
21/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 324 5970: Thank you.
21/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 462 6415: Thank you ma'am
21/10/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Well Tatend now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 462 6415: I don't think, I am sure that it's a life changing decision because look for example our economy in Zimbabwe comparing it to Indias economy you can clearly see the bigger picture. Not only in terms of the economies, but just switching the environment or moving abroad gives you that exposure of things which u do not see in your country. That's giving you ideas of what you can invest back to your loved ones, the country where you come from. And it will help in improving the standards of these people.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 462 6415: And you have a chance to earn certifications and degrees that are recognised world wide. Which makes it easy to maneuver in different countries.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tatenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
21/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 324 5970: You have a good appreciation of how bad things are here in Zimbabwe. Your observations are spot on. These opportunities to study abroad are rare and difficult to come by. We have always been discussing these issues with Tatenda and I have gathered that he is eager to take up such opportunities. Thank you for your consideration.
21/10/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate your kind words Dr Amos!

I am glad that you are supporting Tatenda to pursue higher education in India.
21/10/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: May I have Tatenda's O level results please?
21/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Ok let me scan them and forward them to you.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Tatenda is quite excited about this opportunity. He is currently at school and might be facing network challenges. I will  be sending you the results soon.
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Sure please Dr Amos.
21/10/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I understand please.

Are you aware that Senior Academician Mr Piyush also visited St Ignatius College when he was in Zimbabwe?
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 462 6415: That I am not aware, all maybe I might have seen him but we didn't have a talk
21/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 324 5970: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Tatenda O'Level Results
21/10/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Dr Amos
21/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: So Tatenda, what motivates you to study Architecture please?
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 324 5970: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Other certificates for Tatenda for your consideration.
21/10/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Dr Amos.

Let me get these evaluated.
21/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Basically when I was introduced to design and technology, it aroused my moral for designing and also with an addition of cad softwares made it more fun to design
21/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 462 6415: As I was now able to design real time houses and other stuffs like furniture
21/10/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Well that's wonderful!

So did you ever happen to research about the requirements too?
21/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Yeah I did some research. Mainly in terms subjects needed. So most of the sites mentioned Maths and Design and technology /physics as the two fundamentals that are needed.
21/10/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!

So why didn't you pursue Physics in your A level, Tatenda?
21/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 462 6415: After doing my research which said you can have either physics or design and technology to do architecture I was okay with not doing physics. And also at first for A-level I had applied for maths, DnT and Physics but because the physics class was over flooded they had to replace it with computer science.
21/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 462 6415: So when the O-level results came I had a chance to petition to do physics but for me it was no longer worth it since I had better marks in computer science
21/10/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!

However considering the requirements to pursue Architecture Engineering, Physics is a mandatory requirement!

To pursue Engineering even in Zimbabwe, Tatenda, Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement please.
21/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Understood ma'am so what do you suggest I should do.
21/10/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Considering your subjects and interests you can pursue *Bachelor in planning*, however do note that the same is a niche course and not many universities offer scholarship on the same so that costs are slightly higher.

Shall I brief you about the course first so that you understand better?
21/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Thank you for this suggestion. Yes, go ahead and explain more about this course, what is involved and the career prospects.
21/10/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Sure please Dr Amos

21/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 462 6415: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 462 6415: I think it's a good one it doesn't divert much from what I was planning. I think we can give it a try.
21/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 462 6415: I am willing to do it
21/10/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Tatenda!
21/10/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
21/10/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tatenda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 324 5970: I am happy that in recommending this degree program you have considered Tatenda's interest and prior learning. I am also convinced that the degree fits well with his passion. I am also glad that Tatenda has expressed interest in the degree program. Thank you for your wise guidance.
21/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 462 6415: The next five years is just a dream that has been living in my heart. Being given this carrier I see my self setting the world on fire. Like our school motto says. The fire of good deeds, spreading the love and promoting being man and women for and with others. And also being able to lift my family to standards they have never imagined. And to give back to the community that raised me to be were I am today. Like I sad its a dream in making.
21/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: It's great to have you thoroughly following the discussion, Dr Amos.
21/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tatenda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Getting into Edoofa's program will help in making this dream a reality. With the program providing financial aid I will be able to work to the best of my ability and prove to those who gave me the chance that they didn't waste a chance
21/10/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Admirable indeed, Tatenda!
21/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 462 6415: The main reason I want to study abroad instead of my own country is that  studying abroad provides me with a higher chance of finding a job after I Finish my course, unlike in my country were one has an accounts degree but you see him working as a vendor, were the youth after graduation the only thing he could think of a selling and doing drugs. I need an environment which is free of this thoughts. Because looking at the employment crises it undermines or discards the passion of learning. You wount see the value of education in an environment like that.
21/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 462 6415: And also the exposure of meeting new people and ideas
21/10/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Tatenda, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure too!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
21/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Although I didn't do the research or let me say thorough research. They are indicators which obviously show that India is a higher education destination. For example if we look at the global Cambridge awards you will find out that the hardest subjects of Cambridge prizes are mostly taken by Indians, the likes of maths, physics and computer science. This shows that there systems are very effective and are prosperous
21/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 462 6415: And also the fact that India is a fast growing economy. I think its number three after USA and China. The education system is decent and well recognized worldwide.
21/10/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see that you have some knowledge and awareness, Tatenda
21/10/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

21/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Indeed, it's India's century.
21/10/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued, Dr Amos

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 324 5970: No, we have not done much research into this.
21/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Like father said
21/10/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
21/10/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/10/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/10/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2700-$3700 per year as Bachelor in planning is a niche course and not many universities offer scholarship for the same. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/10/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2700-3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Isn't that exciting?
21/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 324 5970: It's quite exciting indeed. I also like the ' Earn while  you learn' initiative in that, besides lessening the fees burden on us parents, it also gives our children the necessary exposure to the world of work, in the process gaining work experiences and work discipline. I am grateful that the Edoofa program affords our learners this opportunity.
21/10/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Dr Amos!

You understood the very motive behind the Earn While You Learn Program itself!

Let me share more!
21/10/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/10/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Well understood Ms. Harmehak.
21/10/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/10/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 324 5970: This is well explained and understood.
21/10/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to have you thoroughly following, Dr Amos.
21/10/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Understood maam
21/10/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: That's good, Tatenda.
21/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Indeed I can!
21/10/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Tatenda,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.
21/10/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Tatenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/10/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Around 1500 to 2100
21/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 462 6415: That would be great
21/10/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/10/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/10/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: Tatenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Indeed it has how can you have all of that in one goal. That's amazing
21/10/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/10/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/10/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Understood man just wanted to ask which stage a we on right now.
21/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Now can you address for me which stage we are at currently, Tatenda?
21/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 462 6415: I think we are on stage 2
21/10/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: You would begin with your Stage 2 on Monday!

Currently we are concluding Stage 1!
21/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

21/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Thank you ma'am for the heads up
21/10/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
21/10/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
21/10/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
21/10/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Dr Amos, kindly feel free to connect with Mrs Ruth too!
21/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Thank you for the contact it will really help. Let me contact her
21/10/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
21/10/23, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that we have students who would be coming to India from St Ignatius College in August, 2024, Tatenda?
21/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 462 6415: I am not aware, I hadn't heard anyone who is coming
21/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: I hope it must be exciting to know now?
21/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: They are the students who are right now writing their A level exams.
21/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Sure, I will do. Thank you.
21/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Yeah that would be really nice.
21/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
21/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Ohhhh okay I will hear from them.
21/10/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Your school authorities are aware of the students please.

Mr Maganga would be in a great position to assist you as well.
21/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Indeed I will talk to Mr Maganga and find out
21/10/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Tatenda!
21/10/23, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
21/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 324 5970: That's quite encouraging.
21/10/23, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Dr Amos.
21/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Not yet ma'am if I will think of any I will just ask you
21/10/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Tatenda
21/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 462 6415: Noted
21/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

22/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 324 5970: Greetings to you Sahil. I am Tatenda's father. Tatenda is currently at school and has no access to internet today. He had promised to join us tommorow as initially indicated. I don't know whether it's still ok to proceed in his absence.
22/10/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263773245970 It's perfectly fine to proceed in Tatenda's absence. We have indeed started Stage 2 today, which primarily involves interviews with parents.
22/10/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
22/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 324 5970: Yes, we had a fruitful session with Ms. Harmehak yesterday. I also had a chance to go through the material that she shared and also to listen to testimonials from students already in the EDOOFA program.
22/10/23, 12:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
22/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Yes, I phoned and talked to her yesterday evening.  She assured me that the EDOOFA program is good. That her daughters have had the opportunity to access affordable and quality higher education through the program. That the program ensures that her daughter get exposure to 21st job skills through the live projects and internships offer under the program. That EDOOFA counselors are always available for support through out the course of study. She encouraged us to just follow the required processes and pray that our son will also qualify for the program.
22/10/23, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
22/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Indeed she is determined and focused. She heaped praises to the EDOOFA program for making her dreams and those of her two daughters come true. Thank you for the support that you have given her.
22/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
22/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 324 5970: I have been going through the FAQ document and I should say most of the questions I had are answered therein. However, should I happen to have a question as we proceed I will bring it to your attention.
22/10/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!
22/10/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Quite inspiring. You're doing a wonderful job.
22/10/23, 2:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, this year over 1700 students and parents attended this session, So now I would like to hear from you, as your parents are they willing to support you to the fullest so that you, can work hard and be a part of the Edoofa Program for further intake?
22/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 324 5970: We understand that the EDOOFA program is in high demand and the interest in the program is overwhelming. As Tatenda's parents we are willing to support Tatenda and to encourage him to continue working hard so that he can qualify for the program.
22/10/23, 2:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 324 5970: 1. B Plan or Bachelor of Planning 
2. India 
3. 6 000 - 8 000 USD per year
4. 2700 - 3700 USD per year 
5. 350 USD
6. 7 days
7. Yes, I am clear on this.
22/10/23, 2:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you ready for the same ?
22/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 324 5970: I have a question. What are the final A'level results requirement as per the EDOOFA program?
22/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 324 5970: Yes, we're ready.
22/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
22/10/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes
22/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 324 5970: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th October 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 324 5970: I would opt for the first option that we pay $200 around 27th or 28th of October and the balance in November. Yes, we are ready for this option.
22/10/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please can you answer using voice notes ?
22/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 324 5970: <Media omitted>
