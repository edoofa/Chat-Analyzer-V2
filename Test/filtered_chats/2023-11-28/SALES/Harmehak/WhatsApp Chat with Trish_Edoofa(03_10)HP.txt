07/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 215 9496: i mean our family is not united so all of them will be on their families and no one will help
07/10/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, 

However, I am referring to your parents.
07/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 215 9496: yes they are willing to support me
07/10/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Did you discuss regarding your plans to study in India with your parents, Trish?
07/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 215 9496: yes I did they are the ones who encouraged me to apply for this program
07/10/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

May I know more about their financial plan to assist you?
07/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 215 9496: they don't have any financial plan  because they don't  have the money yet
07/10/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Trish?
07/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 215 9496: ok my parents are not financially stable they encouraged me to apply so that if by the grace of God I get the scholarship I will not have to stay at home
07/10/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: I understand Trish!

So may I know your understanding of the scholarship please?

As to what expenses would be catered for?
07/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 215 9496: i don't have much idea about it and i don't  what expenses does it cater
07/10/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however do you understand the following?

There are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 215 9496: ohh yeah thankyou I didn't know about the difference thankyou so much
07/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 215 9496: so this means you will only cater for tuition fees right
07/10/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee like discussed earlier, please.
07/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 215 9496: ok i understand
07/10/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: I will be scheduling your session for *Monday at 09 AM CAT*, as my working hours were over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.* <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 10:47 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning,

*"Never give up until you've given out all your very best. It's better to fail trying than wondering what could have happened if you tried." - Jermaine Lamarr Cole*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
11/10/23, 10:20 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
11/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 215 9496: hello i do want to preserve a sit for the scholarship
