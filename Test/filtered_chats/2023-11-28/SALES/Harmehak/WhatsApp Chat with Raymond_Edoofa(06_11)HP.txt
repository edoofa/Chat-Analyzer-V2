We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Knowing a person better makes you communicate  better
09/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
09/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Well Raymond now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it is
As my future plans on education they are at a lesser extent supported by the Zimbabwean education system
09/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: You see, Raymond, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it is especially this side 
Its not the matter of education but its now the matter of who you know in the system or how much money do youhave
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Raymond.
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Would you say you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I can not say l am or am not as l do not know the way they survive on the orther side 
But dispite that as long as some one can survive there another person can
09/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand what you are sharing Raymond.

I believe this video must have helped, isn't it?
09/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes it did
09/11/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
09/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes they are willing
But on the financial part l can not promise anything things are getting tougher as each day goes by
09/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

So how are you planning your higher education, Raymond?
09/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Still in progress as am trying to create a bridge before l arrive to cross the lake
09/11/23, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.

Meanwhile, may I know if you would agree that studying abroad would require financial support?
09/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Yes l agree
09/11/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: So what's your financial planning for higher education in India?
09/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I have none 
My family will not be able to afford it
09/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Raymond.
09/11/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
09/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Going for tertiary it's costly
09/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, so how are you planning your higher education even if you stay in Zimbabwe, Raymond?
09/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 634 7770: I was planning to go to air force since l can not afford tertiary
09/11/23, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Meanwhile, may I ask who supports your school education financially, Raymond?
09/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 634 7770: My parents
09/11/23, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

So aren't they willing to support you for your higher education along with the scholarship, Raymond? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 634 7770: They are willing but the financial status does not favour them 
I literally had to cry tears for them to understand why l had to go and learn my A Level at St Columba's
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand the situation Raymond.

So let me share a document with you, do go through the same and inform me once you have read it.
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 634 7770: Thank you
10/11/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

10/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
10/11/23, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
10/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 634 7770: 1.it is a program that offers scholarships based on the child's academics 
The interview that will be held will also contribute on the intake of the child
 
2.the financial aspect is based on how much percentage the Edoofian project has offered the child 
The child has to pay annually $2000-$3000 towards the education
10/11/23, 10:43 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

And did you discuss the details with your parents too?
11/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 634 7770: No have not

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 211 6543: Yes
27/11/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Raymond, I have been expecting to hear from you since Thursday,

How would you be able to complete your process like this please?
27/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I don't understand what you mean
27/11/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: You haven't been participating properly since Thursday, Raymond.

How do you plan on completing the Counseling session?

27/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 211 6543: May we please continue
27/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand
27/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 211 6543: I understand 
I am confident
27/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
