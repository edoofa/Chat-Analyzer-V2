23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Well received, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

24/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: So were you able to go through the shared document, Rosemary?
24/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 290 4843: Yes i went through  but i wasn't  finished  yet
24/11/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: I understand
24/11/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
24/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 290 4843: I understand that the  Edoofa fully  funded scholarship is that these are the scholarships in which a philanthropist charitable organizations/Government  body sponsor a student completely,right from application to travel to education and living expenses.
Also you feel  your responsibility to educate the students that  there are a lot of organizations claiming to help students with fully funded scholarship under the garb of being a charitable organization.

Edoofa helps me by being a social,for profit organization which aims to help deserving students with life changing Opportunities to further their careers  through affordable  higher education as well as  internship  opportunities.

You also interview each student to look for deserving students so that  you can make them a part of Edoofa and help them make education affordable with  help of this grant.

This scholarships helps me to reduce the cost and expences  of higher education in India and this is a 50 -100%scholarship on the tuition fee. I also understand that the average cost of education in India for international students is  $6000 -8000 per year.
The other thing is that you value, which you look for in a student is the  right attitude and discipline. 

Edoofa encourages  students to  make an informed decision , considering  the logical and practical aspects of the education,also Edoofa brings excellent  higher education at an affordable costs.

Also your Proud Edoofians will be involved in the Earn while You learn program by learning various skills and then  working on projects that are related to the employability.

This Edoofa scholarship program understands that   through the earn while you  learn program ,students get an opportunity to not just get  trained but also to earn scholarship  credits.

And about Admission  process you have to know each other and to know about the edoofa program , getting counselling understand and build the career plan.


Lastly  i learnt about the students community that education is not learning of facts, but the training  of then mind to think and education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change  the world. Then i saw the photo gallery.
24/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed, Rosemary.

So did you discuss with your family too?
24/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Yes we did discussed  with my family

24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, that's good,

So do you understand the following?
24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 290 4843: Yes i understood
24/11/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: And have you discussed the finances with your parents too?
