23/11/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening,

*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Chaumba C  Elvis. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
23/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
24/11/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
25/11/23, 5:55 am - +27 71 922 2718: Good morning.Which scholarship programs are on offer?And how do l go about it if Elvis is chosen?
27/11/23, 1:07 pm - +27 71 922 2718: He is looking for Sponsorship to study in Europe
27/11/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
27/11/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers scholarship to those who wish to study in India.
27/11/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Also, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
27/11/23, 1:15 pm - +27 71 922 2718: Thank you
27/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

So far do you have any queries from what we have discussed?
27/11/23, 1:19 pm - +27 71 922 2718: All is clear no more questions
27/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Mr Christopher, I believe Elvis must be aware that Edoofa is a program for those who wish to study in India,

So now shall we proceed ahead with the discussion?
27/11/23, 1:25 pm - +27 71 922 2718: We will discuss when he closes because he is at a boarding school
27/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I can understand,

Aren't you able to communicate with him please?
27/11/23, 1:29 pm - +27 71 922 2718: For now he doesn't have a phone
27/11/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

By when are you expecting to discuss with him?
27/11/23, 1:30 pm - +27 71 922 2718: On 10th December
27/11/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright Mr Christopher.

Do you wish for me to hold his application until then?
27/11/23, 1:34 pm - +27 71 922 2718: Just hold on until early December
27/11/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

I shall expect to hear from you in that case, Mr Christopher.
27/11/23, 1:40 pm - +27 71 922 2718: Yes ,definitely
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: I wish you a blessed day ahead
