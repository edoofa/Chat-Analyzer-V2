As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
23/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 377 1666: I am not familiar with it
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

23/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 377 1666: Umm yes it is affordable
23/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 377 1666: Sir you mean you pay half tuition in the first semester then half in the second
23/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: yes
23/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 377 1666: Noo I do not have any idea
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
