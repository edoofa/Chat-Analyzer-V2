So what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education, Mrs Truphena?
03/11/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 5080921: Medical sciences
03/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!

And what motivates her to pursue the same?
03/11/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 5080921: What has motivates her is when she was  3 years old she sustained some burns at our neighbor's place and that  left with scars on some parts of her body that is at the back and part of her hand.  So according to her she would want to help people medically because had it not been for the medical personnel maybe she would lost her Life. The burns were first degree and stayed in the hospital for 3 months.
03/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry to hear that, please.

It's great to see she came out stronger from it!
03/11/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 5080921: Thank you
03/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Truphena, why didn't she pursue Physics and Chemistry as individual subjects since she has interests in medicine please?
03/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 5080921: Physics and chemistry are combined to form science but are learnt individually.
03/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 5080921: During final exams it comes as science
03/11/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!

However they are crucial in results as separate subjects for a student who wishes to study medicine.
03/11/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 5080921: Ok I see kindly advise since it will come out as science on her grade 12 certificate
03/11/23, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mrs Truphena!
03/11/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Now considering her interests and subjects,

She can pursue *Bachelor of science in Medical laboratory Technology*

More than 80% of the students opt for this field itself as it very well caters for their medical field and if Luyando happens to perform well she can badge a higher quantum of scholarship too!

Shall I brief you about the same?
03/11/23, 2:43 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please
03/11/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Following would be description about Medical Laboratory Technology!

Kindly advise.
Thank you and looking forward to having another session with you. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
04/11/23, 9:34 am - +260 97 5080921: Yes please
04/11/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: How are you doing today please?
04/11/23, 9:39 am - +260 97 5080921: Good morning iam doing fine thank you
04/11/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Mrs Truphena, I completely understand what you are sharing.

However before I add, I would firstly like to know the requirements for Medicine from you in Zambia please.
04/11/23, 9:53 am - +260 97 5080921: Five o levels credit or better with mathematics, English and science.
04/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Alright please!

From what our students from Zambia have shared along with what are founders shared when they visited Zambia,

It was shared that Physics, Chemistry and Biology are a mandatory requirement.

Wouldn't you agree please?
04/11/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 5080921: I agree with you, we have two types of sciences here pure sciences were chemistry and physics are learnt individually and on certificate appear as such, then the one my child is doing despite the components been taught separately during final exam the two are combined and it will appear as science. Otherwise physics and chemistry makes science. I don't know how I can stress this point that she takes physics, chemistry 
and biology as sciences .
Thank you
04/11/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I completely understand please.

And I accept the fact that she is pursuing all subjects, however here in India they are required as individual subjects on results too.

However let me get her documents evaluated and get back to you.
04/11/23, 10:16 am - +260 97 5080921: Ok I understand ami allowed to make a request before the documents are evaluated?
04/11/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Sure please, go ahead.
04/11/23, 10:26 am - +260 97 5080921: I request that someone from Zambia is engaged on my behalf because science combined as it is, is considered when one apply in the field of medicine because that's how the curriculum is not all schools offers pure sciences were chemistry and physics appears as individual subjects. I feel my child maybe disadvantaged because that is policy and has no control over it she was just placed. 
Thank you for your patience and opportunity to stress my point.
04/11/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Duly noted and recieved please!

I completely understand what you are sharing and will accordingly proceed.
04/11/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 5080921: Thank you
04/11/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
04/11/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Mrs Truphena
04/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology: This is a valuable undergraduate degree, and it can provide a strong foundation for pursuing a doctorate in pediatrics. Medical laboratory technology involves understanding and analyzing various medical tests and procedures, which can be relevant knowledge in the medical field.
04/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: I understand that she is considering pursuing a Doctorate in Pediatrics, which is undoubtedly a noble and rewarding career path. However, it's essential to explore alternative options and make an informed decision that aligns with your interests and goals. I'd like to share some thoughts on why Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) can be a compelling choice:

Diverse Career Opportunities: MLT offers a wide range of career opportunities. As an MLT professional, you can work in various settings, including hospitals, clinics, research labs, and public health agencies. Your expertise in medical testing and analysis will be in demand across the healthcare industry.

Essential Role in Healthcare: MLT professionals play a critical role in the healthcare system. They are responsible for conducting diagnostic tests, which form the foundation for medical decisions. Your work directly impacts patient care and treatment plans, making it a vital and rewarding profession.

Shorter Education Path: Unlike a Doctorate in Pediatrics, which requires several years of extensive education and training, MLT programs typically have a shorter duration. You can enter the workforce sooner and start building your career. Additionally, it may be a more cost-effective option.

Opportunity for Specialization: MLT programs often allow you to specialize in specific areas, such as clinical chemistry, microbiology, or hematology. This can help you tailor your career to your interests and passion within the field of laboratory science.

High Demand and Job Security: The demand for MLT professionals continues to grow as healthcare evolves. This translates to job security and numerous job openings. You can find opportunities in different regions and healthcare settings.

Work-Life Balance: MLT careers often offer better work-life balance compared to demanding medical professions. This can be especially important if you value quality time with your family and personal life.

Continuous Learning: The field of MLT is constantly evolving with new technologies and methods. This means you'll have opportunities for ongoing learning and professional development throughout your career.
04/11/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 5080921: Good afternoon Ms Harmehak
MLT seems to be a good field from what you have explained  therefore will give counsel and guidance to Luyando hopefully she will be willing, like I stated earlier she is currently at a boarding school about to sit for her final exams and ending on 20th November, 2023 meanwhile iam requesting that we continue with the evaluation process please. However out of curiosity, kindly confirm if you are offering scholarships in doctorate in pediatrics?
04/11/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: That's alright and understandable. You can surely discuss with her too.
04/11/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue

Above being the reasons, it is unfortunate that we donot offer Medicine.

Now considering her previous results and interests she can also pursue *Bachelor of science in Medical laboratory Technology* as this the course 90% of the students opt for and she can offered 90-100% on the same too.
04/11/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 5080921: Well noted Ms Harmehak thank you so much for taking time to explain and I value your patience with us surely Luyando will definitely come to study India if she is considered please. We are ready to be taken through the next process please.
04/11/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I am pleased to know that, Mrs Truphena.
04/11/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Truphena, meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
04/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please kindly educate us
04/11/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

04/11/23, 3:18 pm - +260 97 5080921: Wow!! This is good and motivating.
04/11/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Tadiwanashe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 5080921: Not at all kindly enlighten us
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 5080921: Thank you for the information Ms Harmehak it's such a relief and Edoofa is really doing a recommendable job to help our children by shaping there future. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I greatly appreciate your kind words please!
04/11/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Truphena, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
04/11/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 5080921: Well noted please
04/11/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: So now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist both you, the parents and Luyando!
04/11/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/11/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 5080921: Interesting!!
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/11/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/11/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 5080921: Very informative and mind blowing
04/11/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: It's great to have you thoroughly following, Mrs Truphena.
04/11/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/11/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please you are indeed unique
04/11/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the pictures and video to learn about the Earn While You Learn Program and how students earn credits, Mrs Truphena.
04/11/23, 3:47 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please kindly allow me to go through today and resume session tomorrow or when we are required by you our able Evaluators please.
04/11/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Would you be able to complete the discussion now itself as we are only left with 10-15 minutes of the discussion?
04/11/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 5080921: Ok I see yes please we can continue
04/11/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.
04/11/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Truphena, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/11/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/11/23, 3:53 pm - +260 97 5080921: $1500 - $2250
04/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Truphena, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/11/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes it is which is a great opportunity
04/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
04/11/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/11/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 5080921: Well noted
04/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/11/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/11/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please
04/11/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/11/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/11/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
04/11/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 5080921: Noted
04/11/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/11/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/11/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your understanding on my current situation will be highly appreciated.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

14/11/23, 12:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
Shall we start our today's session?
14/11/23, 12:24 pm - +260 97 5080921: Iam doing well thank you yes please
14/11/23, 12:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
14/11/23, 12:54 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please
14/11/23, 12:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents acknowledge using voice notes ?
14/11/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 5080921: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21th or 22th November 2023 for $200 and the 21th or 22th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21th or 22th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
14/11/23, 7:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for your response.
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - +260 97 5080921: Iam not due to financial constraints at the moment
14/11/23, 8:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges do you have now ?
14/11/23, 8:35 pm - +260 97 5080921: Financial challenges I can only manage to raise the required amount by 31st February,2024
14/11/23, 8:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: There is no such date available I hope you are aware of that ?
14/11/23, 9:20 pm - +260 97 5080921: Ok I see kindly advise
14/11/23, 9:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These are the only available options
15/11/23, 6:51 am - +260 97 5080921: I discussed with other family members who has pledged and advise that they will help me financially therefore will be able to meet the deadline as stipulated above .

17/11/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 5080921: 3months
17/11/23, 4:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Luyando's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Luyando's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it
17/11/23, 5:08 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please it will.
17/11/23, 5:10 pm - +260 97 5080921: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 5:11 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please it will be convenient for us
17/11/23, 5:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Luyando's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
17/11/23, 5:50 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes please
17/11/23, 5:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM which one suits you ?
17/11/23, 5:53 pm - +260 97 5080921: 10:30 AM will be fine
17/11/23, 6:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Your interview has been scheduled. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.

24/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @260975080921 @260977504060
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 5080921: Good afternoon sir/madam, I really wanted my child to do a course in Indian but from the look of things iam officially counseling the offer due to lack of resources, iam still waiting for the pledges the other family members made things are not as I projected. 
Iam sincerely sorry for the inconveniences that we have caused and I understand your terms and conditions thank you so much for listening and trying everything possible to enroll my child that side.
24/11/23, 4:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So how would you want me to help ?
24/11/23, 4:22 pm - +260 97 5080921: We can afford at the moment maybe in future by God's grace I really don't want to waste more of your time. It seems there is a lot involved which will need money.
24/11/23, 4:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which fees are you really concerned about for now?
24/11/23, 4:24 pm - +260 97 5080921: Enrollment
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You are not ready for $200 ?
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 5080921: The 2000$ also will not be easy because the family members who wanted to help it seems they have financial problems therefore as at now iam not sure.
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - +260 97 5080921: Yes
24/11/23, 4:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Don't get me wrong, but relying on others for your child's education raises questions. Why would someone assist if you haven't taken proactive steps for your child's future? I assume you've been saving for your child's tertiary education over the past 10-12 years, especially considering that schooling is already subsidized by the Zambian government.
24/11/23, 4:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Moreover, you won't be solely responsible for covering the entire fees. Once enrolled, your child can benefit from the EWYL program, providing them with the opportunity to contribute towards their own fees, easing your financial burden.
24/11/23, 4:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 11:24 am - +260 97 5080921: I understand your point of view because you have the right to your own opinion.Subsized yes for those who are not in grant aided school mine was at a mission boarding school called mpunde secondary school. Saving for my child 's tertiary education we have been doing that but the money (insurance) will mature in March 2024. Therefore judging me and making such assumptions is really disheartening and shocking. When I applied I clearly stated that my child was in her final hence I would prefer August 2024 intake knowing that I will have enough time to put things in place , but to my surprise you started demanding for enrollment fee which is k8000.. in zambian kwacha which for can't be sourced within 1 month alone hence the need to involve other family members. Iam a civil servant who doesn't earn much but I try by all means to do abit of business in addition to my job to help my husband educate our children, Luyando by the is not the only child we have we have other 4 one completed her tertiary education just waiting to be employed and the other one still at college then the other two at primary level which is subsidized by the government.
So please judging me and doubting my parenting has not gone well with me. Tomorrow please allow me to exit all the groups and counsel the application thank you.
25/11/23, 11:28 am - +260 97 5080921: I have very much confidence I know my child can do exploits but for now it won't work out otherwise thank you.
27/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you had a pleasant weekend.

So shall we start our discussion now?
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 5080921: Kindly refer to the attached information.
