01/11/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
01/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 357 1543: Good morning
01/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 357 1543: Okay what l learnt is that it can be funded through the monthly payment of a certain project that you Wii be doing and also the if yo put higher efforts  and able to meet targets you earn higher so that you can fund all the expenses
01/11/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Alright and did you understand the following?
01/11/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Okay thats great
01/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Is the annual fee remain constant through out the annual years of the course
01/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, it remains constant.
01/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Okay thank you
01/11/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
01/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 357 1543: No
01/11/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Did you discuss the same with your family too?
01/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Yes
01/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: What were their thoughts on the same please?
01/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Okay they just agreed with the annual fee after getting the scholarship and the way to fund the expenses since there is an increase in experience in doing such
01/11/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: . <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Brendon, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
01/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Yes l agree
01/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: So considering the same, what are your thoughts on the cost of education in India?

Now that you have an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program too.
01/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Okay they are good
01/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so who would be the one supporting you financially, Brendon?
01/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 357 1543: My mother
01/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly discuss everything with her please?
01/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Yes I had
01/11/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: What were her thoughts on the discussion so far?
01/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 357 1543: She is still agreeing with it
01/11/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please!

01/11/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, you can request her to acknowledge in that case, Brendon.

06/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Thank you
06/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
06/11/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared information?
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Yes
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 357 1543: Without a scholarship for me it will be difficult to afford costs to cover the education
06/11/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
06/11/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/11/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/11/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/11/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
06/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I will be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 11:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future

09/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

17/11/23, 5:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
17/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 71 148 6267: Okay l understand thank you
17/11/23, 6:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you understand that how important it is to reserve the seat this month.
17/11/23, 6:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Understanding the cost of education abroad is crucial, and you're spot on about the continuous rise in fees. Each passing month brings an increase, and come January, the annual cost of education abroad is expected to surge even further. With limited scholarship seats available on a first-come, first-served basis, the window of opportunity is narrowing.

By reserving now, you not only secure all the benefits but also lock in the current cost of tertiary education, ensuring it remains constant throughout your child's course. However, delaying may lead to escalated costs, and there's a risk of missing out on the scholarship altogether.

It's a trend in Africa, where parents are proactively reserving seats in advance, realizing the significant savings and peace of mind it brings. In fact, just in last 2 weeks 400+ students have already reserved their seats for 2024, and the rush for 2025 has begun. It's a strategic move to shield themselves from the inevitable rise in costs next year.

The choice is yours, and making an informed decision now could save you thousands of dollars. Many parents have even opted for loans to secure their child's educational future. The clock is ticking – it's time to act and avoid the uncertainty of increased expenses and potential scholarship unavailability.
