19/10/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I can understand,

So how exactly are you planning your higher education in India?
19/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Well ..i was hoping this schoolarship would help me out
19/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Because honestly i hadn't started planning
19/10/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Ruth, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
19/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Okay...now i get it
19/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 616 4869: I went through the document
19/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Its now very clear
19/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 616 4869: All my questions are answered now🙂thank you👏
19/10/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours for the day are over.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.

20/10/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 616 4869: Hello
20/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 616 4869: Good morning
20/10/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: How are you, Ruth?
20/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 616 4869: I am okay and you
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
20/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 616 4869: Good to hear🙂
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 616 4869: 🙂
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss the details with your parents?
20/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 616 4869: Yes yes i did
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
20/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 616 4869: Can i send a voice note
20/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 616 4869: Or its just typing throughout
20/10/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: As the network hinders the quality of the voice note,

A typed message would be better please.
20/10/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay okay
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

You can share your understanding in brief.
20/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 616 4869: I understood that there is a difference between full sponsership and schoolarship ...You guys are assisting one of the lucky African students who are able to get this scholarship by paying part of their tuition fee .I understood that you have   up 1500 seats for African  students throught all well known universities in India. You also explained why India is the most prefered country for one to do their studies ...as compared to China and the US ...this is because the tuition fee of universities there and also the cost of living there is quite expensive as compared to India...Those who wld have been lucky enough to be part of ur programme would get to pay 2000 to 3000 per annum ....depending on the percentage that you are providing..I learnt that u provide a 50-100% scholarship.  I also learn how u guys assist the students under ur programme with how to get their visas ...how you help with everything until they reach India 

I learnt about the earn while you learn programme...where a student gets credits from the what he or she is doing there in India. This program helps students to be employable ...and this programme helps in paying the tuition fee for one's next semester
20/10/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 616 4869: I got an understanding of many things about this programme...and it is a very good one🙂
20/10/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to see that you thoroughly followed the document and understood everything.
20/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 616 4869: Yes yes
20/10/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: I believe you have understood the following please?
20/10/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 616 4869: Yes yes ..i understood this ...and my father also understood
20/10/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So far are there any queries?
20/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 616 4869: Mmmm nooo as for me i dont have any quiries
20/10/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Alright please
20/10/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you with $2000 annually?
20/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 616 4869: Thank you so much for enlightening me👏
20/10/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
20/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 616 4869: I wld have to get reassurance from my dad ...since he is doing a number of projects ...let me gv him a call to confirm once again if he is willing to support
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Sure please Ruth
20/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 616 4869: He said yes🙂he is willing to support
20/10/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I believe it must be encouraging for you and your father to know that you can join other students from Dewure high?
20/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay okay ...it wld be an honour to get my friends to be part of ur programme
20/10/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Many students from Dewure high are already a part of the program too!
20/10/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay okay ..that is good to hear😊
20/10/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Also, can you share your O and A Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Food sciences/ Food processing Technology?
20/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay ..i see
20/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 616 4869: Let me send the results through
20/10/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Sure please
20/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 616 4869: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 616 4869: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Duly received please
20/10/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: You can address the remaining part now.
20/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay ....what motivates me is that I have an intrest in working in the food industries..be it the cooking part or the chemistry part of the food
20/10/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: That's admirable, Ruth!

So did you also research about your desired course please?
20/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 616 4869: Im still under the research...but i know it is a good course
20/10/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: That's great;

However what exactly do you wish to become after completing the course, Ruth?
20/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 616 4869: I wish to be working in food industries..checking out food samples ...anything that has to do with food and healthy eating
20/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 616 4869: For example here in Zimbabwe ...in my home town Chiredzi..there is a sugar milling company ....there are people who take samples of sugar cane ...and get to know the amount of sugar dfrnt varieties of sugar cane have <This message was edited>

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
21/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 616 4869: Hello...im sorry my wifi network is down

21/10/23, 12:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
21/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Yes ..we ddnt talk much ..but she enlightened me  ...and also gave me confidence in ur programme
21/10/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/10/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?

21/10/23, 8:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same ?
21/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 616 4869: I believe they are

21/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Okay ..he will get to you very soon
21/10/23, 8:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
21/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 750 3842: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or

21/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
21/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th October 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
21/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 750 3842: I have not been prepared for this in this Month October since I still have outstanding fees for Ruth's siblings which are due this month and finally end of November. This means I can only slot in my commitment in December 2023
22/10/23, 10:03 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 616 4869: Hello 😊
22/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 616 4869: I'm okay and you
22/10/23, 11:33 am - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Ruth's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Ruth's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?@263777503842
22/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 616 4869: Truely this will be convenient 🙂....I'll await and see what he has to say

How are you doing today?
27/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 616 4869: Im okay hwu
27/10/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
27/10/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
27/10/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
