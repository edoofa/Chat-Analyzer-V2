09/11/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Mr. Leonard and Mrs. Hessie.
09/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 327 7202: I have read but I'm failing to download the pictures cz of network challenges
09/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Very impressive milestones.
09/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 327 7202: From the above information I can acknowledge that India is one of the best countries in the world that offers vast education and job opportunities through its quality education system
09/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Leonard and Mrs. Hessie! After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Theophelus to India for his higher studies!
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Yes. India would be our choice. I'm anxious to know which universities offer the preferred study program
09/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 327 7202: We are very much interested but we need to know the universities and their ratings
09/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Leonard and Mrs. Hessie. I would like to inform you that Theophelus's application is receiving individual attention, and the university details tailored to his qualifications will be shared in the later stages of our counseling process. Your understanding and patience as we navigate through this personalized journey are truly valued.
09/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Noted with thanks
09/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
09/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Yes, our elder son studied in China without scholarship funding, so we are familiar with such costs
09/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Leonard! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
09/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
09/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 754 0829: I see, with China the cost was somewhat lower 4500 - 6000 per year, without scholarship. It became quite a task when the payment system changed to require students to pay full yearly fees in one installment.
09/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mr. Leonard. The total cost is divided into two equal installments, with each installment due before the commencement of a semester. The academic year is divided into two semesters. May I know whether you find that affordable, please?
09/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 754 0829: I appreciate the bit played by Edoofa and wish I could outrightly say yes, but considering the fact that one of Theo's parents (myself) is retired it still feels a bit on the high side.
09/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Leonard. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
09/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Please explain further so I will know how that operates
09/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Leonard. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
09/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Yes, he will definitely benefit from the EWYL program as he has displayed eagerness to tackle challenging tasks.
09/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
09/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
09/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

09/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Theophelus can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his parents?
09/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Interesting, so how many credits can one earn by completing a single assignment?
09/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Leonard. I would like to inform you that there is no limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.
09/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 754 0829: I was trying to quantify or qualify what  *working hard* may entail and the reward thereto.
09/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I appreciate your perspective, Mr. Leonard. Essentially, the structure mirrors an internship, involving various tasks or projects. The accumulation of scholarship credits is tied to the quantity of successfully completed projects. It's important to note that there isn't a fixed number of credits assigned per project, as this valuation varies based on the nature and complexity of each task. This flexible approach ensures a nuanced recognition of the diverse efforts and contributions made by the students.
09/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Understood, thank you
09/11/23, 10:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you through the process, Mr. Leonard!
09/11/23, 10:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/11/23, 10:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/11/23, 10:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/11/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 754 0829: 4. Higher Education Concierge <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:52 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Designing a practical employment oriented curriculum
09/11/23, 11:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Hessie. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
09/11/23, 11:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Leonard. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
09/11/23, 11:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Theophelus studying abroad?
09/11/23, 11:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 11:33 pm - +263 77 754 0829: Noted thanks
10/11/23, 12:19 am - +263 77 327 7202: Very true
10/11/23, 9:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Learning never exhausts the mind." - Leonardo da Vinci*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 327 7202: Sorry we have a busy day will be free after 4pm CAT then we can start the session
10/11/23, 10:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Hessie!
10/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concern, Mrs. Hessie. Let us connect at *4:00 P.M. CAT* to resume your session. I will be looking forward to your response.
10/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 327 7202: Sure we will be ready by then
10/11/23, 12:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Hessie. I will be waiting for your response.
10/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Available now
10/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mrs. Hessie!
10/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
10/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 327 7202: I feel great because it broadens his horizon, he will have access to world class academic institutions, he will connect to international networks, he will develop  invaluable personal and professional skills and gains vast experience from different cultures as he will meet people from different nations
10/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
10/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
10/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 327 7202: I think those are the major requirements including his results
10/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
10/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 4:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
10/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Noted
10/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
10/11/23, 6:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
10/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
10/11/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 905 0792: I think it's their network I'm failing to reach them too
10/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Theophelus!
10/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Theophelus. However, I would request you to be active for the next 15 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
10/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Yes thank you, and I hope you had a good day
10/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am doing fine as well, Theophelus. Thank you for acknowledging!

10/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Theophelus!
10/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated in the previous messages, please?
10/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Yes
10/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Theophelus! So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
10/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Earn while you earn program is key once I enroll, and it begins before finishing A level
10/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
10/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Thank you
10/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Stage 1
Personalized counseling session
10/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
10/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Yes I believe you explanations give clarity
10/11/23, 10:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
10/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Yes thank
10/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 905 0792: You
10/11/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
10/11/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

10/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 905 0792: From my end I'm satisfied thank, I guess my parents will ask if any when they are reachable
10/11/23, 10:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Theophelus!
10/11/23, 10:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

14/11/23, 11:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
14/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 905 0792: Morning, thank you 
I'm ready
14/11/23, 11:54 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
14/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 754 0829: Good morning, my apologies I am tied up at the moment. I will let you know when ready
Thank you
14/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 905 0792: Yes no stone was left unturned, it was insightful
14/11/23, 11:58 am - Sahil Edoofa: Its really good to know , So far do you have any questions for me ?
14/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 905 0792: No, I'd like to listen first
14/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 327 7202: My apology I'm busy during the day
14/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Certainly! Before we delve into the interview, I noticed in your application that you held esteemed positions such as Child Vice President of Zimbabwe, Minister of Health and Child Care, and Senator. Additionally, you've been an active advocate for child rights and sexual and reproductive health rights. I'm curious to understand why you chose computer science over law, especially considering your involvement in roles that seem more inclined towards the legal field.
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 905 0792: I am passionate about computer science. I enjoy the workspaces. Now when it comes to my roles in the legal field, it came as a hidden talent that I discovered. I am no feasible for sporting activities due to a health condition and as a result I ended up investing into in door activities and surprisingly I found myself thriving. So I continued to invest. Now on a comparison, I am a technical person, quite evident with development of the walking stick. And I enjoy that more which led me to this point
14/11/23, 1:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights! It's truly fascinating to hear about your passion for computer science and how you've discovered hidden talents in the legal field. Your journey in investing time and effort into indoor activities, particularly your technical skills evident in the development of the walking stick, showcases your versatility. Could you elaborate on how these experiences have shaped your aspirations for the future?
14/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Alright, as a result, I've discovered the use of the legal field skills vital in defending projects which I would like to work on in the computer science field
14/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
14/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Personally, I haven't especially considering I had no questions for her, all were answered on this platform
14/11/23, 7:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
14/11/23, 7:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!

14/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 905 0792: I'm sure, they will answer when they are reachable
14/11/23, 7:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you answer this in their behalf ?
14/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 905 0792: Alright then

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7 days but a payment plan can be arranged 

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

Yes
14/11/23, 7:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same ?
14/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 905 0792: I'm pretty sure yes, but they'll confirm
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

17/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 754 0829: I would opt for 1 however, we are financially not ready to work with the timelines therein.
Theo is still in L6 and we're currently planning finances for his U6 studies hence we're unable to pay for enrollment as indicated.
We would appreciate if it is possible to defer this opportunity to next year (2024) so Theo will not lose out.
Thank you
17/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is well understood and being a parent it is important to have proper planning for your child's career!
There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.


Furthermore, if you enroll and through the Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program, students have a 20-month period to learn and earn. This substantial duration allows students to self-finance a significant portion of their fees in their home country by utilizing spare time effectively. For instance, if a student works diligently and earns $80-100 per month during the EWYL program, they can accumulate enough funds to self-finance their entire fees. This approach significantly alleviates the financial burden on their parents.

18/11/23, 7:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

Cost of Education: Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

Time Horizon: Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

Financial Stability: By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK: Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

Teach Financial Responsibility: Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

Avoiding Last-Minute Rush: Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

Goal Setting: Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

Peace of Mind: Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Sorry we are busy at work
20/11/23, 4:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through this ?
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 327 7202: Yes

20/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 327 7202: I understood the reasons for early financial planning for tertiary education
20/11/23, 5:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Theophelus's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

22/11/23, 6:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you elaborate
22/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 327 7202: It's good to start EWYL early to earn more credits so that by the time he starts higher education some expenses or fees portion will be covered from the credits earned
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Definitely you can see this student earned his entire fees by himself through EWYL even bought a laptop recently from his EWYL earnings.
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 327 7202: That's great
