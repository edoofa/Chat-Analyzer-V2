03/10/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/10/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
03/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 952 6649: Wow, this sounds great, I now understand what it is, thankyou very much for giving me all this explanation
03/10/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
03/10/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
03/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 952 6649: What happens to the student who doesn't have  money if you offer her 50%?
03/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 952 6649: And after completing the program, do you also offer them jobs that side?
03/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 952 6649: If being offered 100% scholarship are there any other additional expenses?
03/10/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Mrs Evelyn, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
03/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 952 6649: Thankyou so much I understand
03/10/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
03/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 952 6649: It sounds good, at least I now understand what Edoofa is, otherwise it was blank to me, you have opened my eyes thanks a lot
03/10/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
03/10/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

03/10/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 09 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 952 6649: You really trying to accommodate everyone who wishes to improve him/herself at higher level in education
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mrs Evelyn.
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Evelyn, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1500-$2000*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
04/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 952 6649: That's great, it's really understood I appreciate thankyou
04/10/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: That's great!

So far, do you have any queries Mrs Evelyn?
04/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 952 6649: What else do you cover if child gets selected do you help them to get Visa  and traveling expenses?
04/10/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: The program offers scholarship on tuition fee itself!

Considering the amount after scholarship that would include Food, Accomodation, Basic university expenses.
04/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 952 6649: Ok thanks a lot
04/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 952 6649: I think so far I have understood almost everything. Thanks a lot
04/10/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss the same in detail as well once you move to further stages!
04/10/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Alright please, now let me brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist both you and Siyamthanda

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/10/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 952 6649: This is very good Program and helpful, especially for me and my Siyamthanda
04/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 952 6649: It really reduces expenses and make things easier
04/10/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mrs Evelyn!
04/10/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/10/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 952 6649: Thankyou so much for all this information, I now have wide knowledge about Edoofa
04/10/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Mrs Evelyn!
04/10/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 952 6649: Very true, I can realize you are different in many ways from other countries,  I really appreciate
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted!
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 952 6649: Yes I'm ready thankyou
04/10/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evelyn, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/10/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 952 6649: For $300  a student will spend $1500:  then for $450 a student will spend  $2250:
04/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evelyn, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 952 6649: No not at all, I didn't think so, that's great thankyou very much for all this information
04/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 952 6649: You're such a wonderful organization Edoofa
04/10/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please?

Don't you agree that Edoofa is making to easier?
04/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 952 6649: I'm saying Edoofa is making everything easier for the parents and learners, thankyou so much
04/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 952 6649: I'm impressed thankyou
04/10/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please!
04/10/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/10/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/10/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 952 6649: Excellent Edoofa, it's very true that us as parents we always face challenges with payment of fees, but you are making things flexible for both parents and students, thanks a lot I appreciate
04/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 952 6649: This is unbelievable Edoofa keep it up
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: We understand, Mrs Evelyn
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 952 6649: Yes I do understand, thankyou
04/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
04/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
04/10/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 952 6649: Thankyou very much, I understand
04/10/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/10/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

04/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 952 6649: Ok thankyou I will do so
04/10/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
04/10/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/10/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/10/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

11/10/23, 10:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/10/23, 11:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
13/10/23, 10:37 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.

22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?

22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you

22/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready ?
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 052 9351: Yes they are
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th November 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 052 9351: Okay thank you
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ask parents to answer this using voice notes.
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 052 9351: I will ask her
