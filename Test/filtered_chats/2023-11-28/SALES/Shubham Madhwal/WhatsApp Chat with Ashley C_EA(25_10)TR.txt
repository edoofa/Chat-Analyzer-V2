26/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 518 2104: Ok maam
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Tushti: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
26/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 518 2104: Thank u so much for this infor
26/10/23, 2:34 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
26/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 518 2104: During my 5 yrs of training i will make sure that i create strong proffessional networks .I will also do internships and projects which will enable me to secure a job in one of the best companies i will opt for a Masters in Geotechnical engineering I prefer to work outside Zimbabwe .I will make sure to assist my mum and my siblings financially and if possible some of my relatives who are struggling financially to secure better education 5 years after the completion of this course i will be considered one of the best engineers to ever being in Edoofa and my dream to be the best in one of the best companies will be achieved
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Tushti: That is really great Shingirai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
26/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 518 2104: I am willing i will try my level best
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 518 2104: Sorry im using my mums fne i ran out of data Its me  Ashley
26/10/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: Noted, Ashley

26/10/23, 3:11 pm - Tushti: I completely understand the situation in your country and agree that studying abroad is the best decision <This message was edited>

27/10/23, 10:00 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
27/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 120 3055: Good morning...yes we may begin.
27/10/23, 10:19 am - Tushti: What are your thoughts on India?
27/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 120 3055: From what I hav heard, researched, seem I think India is a great place ,full of great opportunities and I think it would b such an honor to continue with my studies in such a remarkable country....
27/10/23, 10:31 am - Tushti: Did this help?
27/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 120 3055: Yes it was of grt help indeed...in enlightening me more about
India....some of the things I was not even aware of...Now iam starting to see India from a new perspective...Thank you very much.
27/10/23, 10:37 am - Tushti: Amazing Ashley, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
27/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 120 3055: Well as for Tution fees I  think depending on the university around $3300 to $7800...Iam not sure though.
27/10/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
27/10/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/10/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/10/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/10/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: In simple words Ashley, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 120 3055: Thank you for the enlightenment.
27/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 120 3055: I thank you also for the effort your organization has been putting in to ensure that every child receives quality education irregardless of their financial backgrounds.
27/10/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
27/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 120 3055: Yes you may.
27/10/23, 11:35 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/10/23, 11:35 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/10/23, 11:35 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/10/23, 11:36 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 120 3055: Yes it is.
27/10/23, 11:59 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
27/10/23, 12:00 pm - Tushti: Ashley, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 120 3055: Okay
27/10/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: Please calculate the answer
27/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 120 3055: $1500-$2250
27/10/23, 12:09 pm - Tushti: Exactly Ashley, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/10/23, 12:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 12:09 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/10/23, 12:09 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 120 3055: Yes I most definitely do.
27/10/23, 12:15 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/10/23, 12:16 pm - Tushti: Ashley, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/10/23, 12:16 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/10/23, 12:16 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
27/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 120 3055: Yes I do
27/10/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Alright Ashley, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/10/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
27/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 120 3055: No questions.
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: Okay
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

22/11/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ms Shingirirai with all due respect I understand your situation, honestly, there are certain instances in our life which are beyond our control, and in fact, we as human beings cannot plan for them as well.
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you as her parents,  you wouldn't have planned for such events and I can understand that your priority shifted from Ashley's Higher Education towards your medications.
22/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your child's academician, I am here to help you out, you see, in such instances, even the Board understands that the situation is beyond an applicant's control and if given a chance, they might be able to get hold of the situation with proper assistance and planning.
22/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you would like me to help you out with a financial plan which might help you in maintaining the priority of your healthcare while ensuring that it is not at the cost of Ashley's bright future, isn't it?
22/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 518 2104: U are right sir  can u please help
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would suggest an alternative fee completion plan for Ashley such that considering this plan it would be convenient for you to secure her seat and at the same time you would not be financially burdened.
22/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 518 2104: Hw is this done sir can u elaborate
22/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ms Shingirirai  as you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider your situation and since Ashley has cleared the required set of eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you would have to *complete a part fee of $100 by Friday, Ie 24th of November*. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In case you complete $100 by Friday, you would have time till the 05th of  December, to complete another $100, and then the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 20 days which would be around the 25th of December 2023.  All in all, for $350 you will have about 40 days to complete the formalities.

Considering your situation, I believe this financial plan would be convenient for you and your family, please?
22/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 518 2104: Thank u let me try my best to use this opportunity
22/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So will you be able to manage the same, Since  you are already prepared with $80 right now?
22/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 518 2104: By tomorrow i will be sure  to tell u my situation

27/11/23, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263775182104 while I am happy for you to proceed ahead towards Nursing, I am quite disappointed with the behaviour that you and your family has shown.
27/11/23, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Throughout your application you never shared your inclination towards pursing Nursing in the first place. May I know what has been the reason behind the same, since all of a sudden you would now like to pursue nursing?

27/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775182104 it should have been brought to attention considering if you would have eligible for the course under the Edoofa Program you would have been guided accordingly
