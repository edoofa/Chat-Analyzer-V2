24/11/23, 11:11 am - Sagar: Good Morning Chooka!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes I did...
We can discuss
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chooka,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 97 1436967: Alright thank you
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Chooka, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Felix, is that correct?
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes sir
24/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Felix, also do tell me whether you learnt about Felix’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - +260 97 1436967: Well,I didn't get enough information that's why I was curious to communicate to an admin..but about the journey and experience of Felix I know something
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: Ok let me brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes Mr Gurvinder,you are right
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Okay so Chooka, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes though my parents are not on WhatsApp,but my aunt can help
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: noted.
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Alright so Chooka, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 1436967: I'm 18 years old,zambian
Went to canisius secondary school and just wrote my grade 12 exams 3 weeks ago,I would like to study economics,I'm weak in sciences,I play basketball
I'm fourth in a poor family of 4 based in monze, southern province, zambia.My parents don't work,my mother is Ill although my father is a bricklayer.If that's not enough you can ask me anything else.
25/11/23, 9:09 am - Sagar: Noted.
25/11/23, 9:10 am - Sagar: Good Morning Chooka,
I hope you are doing well.
25/11/23, 9:11 am - Sagar: In your introduction you wrote that your parents don't work, so may I know who has been supporting you for your education and if they are willing to support you for your higher studies.
25/11/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 1436967: I was supported by the school under bursary,only for secondary level
25/11/23, 4:53 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

27/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 1436967: It is sir, exactly what I was looking for
27/11/23, 2:20 pm - Sagar: Chooka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes
27/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: Alright Chooka, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
27/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes
27/11/23, 6:07 pm - +260 97 1436967: I said my parents can't afford
27/11/23, 6:20 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
27/11/23, 6:22 pm - +260 97 1436967: Thank you and same
