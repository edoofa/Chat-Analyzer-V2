*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

I hope I have contacted the right person.

It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
25/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay good morning
25/11/23, 10:03 am - +258 84 052 7943: What is going on here
25/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure connecting with you Mr.Aldridge Weale,
This is a group made for Bradley's counselling session for the Edoofa scholarship program, your son has filled out the form for the program, and you can confirm the same with him. <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 10:18 am - +258 84 052 7943: Lets go ahead
25/11/23, 10:25 am - Sagar: Mr.Weale, I would like to know if you know anything about the program?
25/11/23, 10:33 am - +258 84 052 7943: Honestly, I don't... Please advise
25/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program.
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25/11/23, 4:56 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

27/11/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: Alright so Bradley, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
27/11/23, 10:04 am - +258 84 052 7943: Good morning all
27/11/23, 10:22 am - Sagar: Good Morning Mr.Weale.
27/11/23, 10:32 am - +258 84 052 7943: I have gone through your program and would greatly appreciate if you could give my son a chance.
27/11/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: We would also want to give Bradley a chance but to do so can you please ask him to come online so we could finish his counselling session.
27/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay so I'm Bradley Weale as you know and I was a student at Guinea Fowl High School for 6 years, and I'm currently waiting for my Advanced level results. During my 6 years of high school I've developed into mature and well groomed young man with the help of my parents as well as my teachers. During my two years of Advanced Level I was studying science subjects namely Maths, Chemistry and Physics in hopes of studying engineering when I go to University. I found myself interested in Technical Graphics and Design so I'm good  at drawing and designing technical things. As a school project I once designed a solar panel holder that could fit different solar panels of different lengths and widths. As for hobbies I enjoy listening to music and drawing. We are a family of four and I'm the oldest of two children. My father is currently employed in Mozambique as a boiler maker and my mother is self-employed
27/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: Great answer Bradley.
27/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 092 6205: Thank you
27/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: So Bradley, could you kindly tell me how much *Guinea Fowl High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
27/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 092 6205: Guinea Fowl High School charges $300 every term and both my parents support my education
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Sagar: Noted.
27/11/23, 10:50 am - Sagar: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
27/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 092 6205: Okay I will
