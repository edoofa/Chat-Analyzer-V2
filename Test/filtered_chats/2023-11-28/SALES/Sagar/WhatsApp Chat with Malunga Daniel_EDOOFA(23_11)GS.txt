23/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Good Morning Daniel, Mr. and Mrs.Malunga!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Hello how are you sir
23/11/23, 12:31 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Daniel,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you Mr Singh
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Daniel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Lyvinia, is that correct?
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess it's correct
23/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Lyvinia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Lyvinia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: The *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is an innovative program managed by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.  The program helps African students to acquire Quality International Tertiary Education, leading them with opportunities to self sponsor in the most affordable way possible.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Students also get to *engage in projects* that are *aimed at career and skill development* , *Network broadening* along with *The Earn While You Learn Program*.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: Great answer Daniel, I can see you are well informed.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 765 8374: No l haven't heard about Lyvinia's journey and experience
23/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sagar added +263 77 904 1204
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess that is absolutely correct
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: Okay so Daniel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I think I do
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sagar: Alright so Daniel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 765 8374: I'm Daniel Malunga  a boy aged 18 and I've just finished writing my Advanced level exams . l was doing Maths , Physics , Geography and Statistics

27/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech Civil Engineering*
27/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you sir I would be happy to do that
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes please
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sagar: Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field.
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: *Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you,  I've understood
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I am l think I'll get higher points
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sagar: That is great, now since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yesss l am let me tell you
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: The eddofa program can help me in my studies and my dreams after 5 yrs are as follows 

After 5 years of doing civil engineering, l could see myself in a variety of different roles and positions within the industry. With the right experience and expertise, l could advance to become project managers, construction managers, or even pursue a career in structural engineering or urban planning.

I may also find myself working on larger and more complex projects, such as highways, bridges, or high-rise buildings. I may have the opportunity to work on projects in different parts of the world, gaining international experience and exposure to different engineering practices and regulations.

Alternatively, after gaining sufficient experience, l may choose to start their own engineering firm or consultancy, offering me expertise to clients and building a reputation in the industry.

Additionally, after 5 years, l may have had the opportunity to obtain professional certifications and licenses, further solidifying their expertise and credibility within the field.

Overall, after 5 years of doing civil engineering, l could see myself in a variety of challenging and rewarding roles, with the potential for career advancement, professional growth, and exciting opportunities within the industry.
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Sorry about the number of words I wanted to express all my dreams
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Sagar: That is really great Daniel I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess l am fully dedicated and willing to give all my best into this
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 765 8374: My mother's hard work also motivates me and l also want to change where l come from
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 765 8374: My country has no exposure to certain things
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: For example our laboratories are outdated and equipments are malfunctioning
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - Sagar: Very good Daniel.
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Thank you sir
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes l wish to do that especially in my rural areas,  the situation there is very tense
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay l would mainly like to renovate laboratories supply them with equipments
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Daniel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess that is correct
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yeah I wonder why
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.
