16/11/23, 12:32 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
16/11/23, 12:32 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
16/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Yes very confident
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 509 3519: For last term l had 12 points
16/11/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
16/11/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 509 3519: No
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

16/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 509 3519: I'm done
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

21/11/23, 5:33 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 5:33 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:33 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
21/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 509 3519: No
21/11/23, 5:35 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 509 3519: No
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:41 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
21/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 509 3519: No
21/11/23, 5:43 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
21/11/23, 5:43 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 509 3519: I think l Will be benefiting but isn't the EWYL Program reduce time for studies and how would someone balance it with the study time
21/11/23, 6:09 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

21/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Point 4
21/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Ok so l will only have to pay $1800
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

21/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 509 3519: OK if l may ask each student 's earn is based on his/her effort at work or the type of work being awarded
21/11/23, 6:32 pm - Arshita: Yes
21/11/23, 6:32 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 509 3519: My Auntie
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Or l first of all do the EWYL program with the help of the Edoofa scholarship
21/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Then parents will help with the remaining fee
21/11/23, 6:38 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
21/11/23, 6:38 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
21/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 509 3519: They are happy
21/11/23, 6:41 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
21/11/23, 6:41 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
21/11/23, 6:41 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 509 3519: -Resume /CV
-Certificate / transcripts of secondary education
-Application form for the university
-Personal statement essay
-Academic references /letters of recommendation
-Language proficiency certification
-Passport
21/11/23, 7:07 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
21/11/23, 7:07 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
21/11/23, 7:07 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
21/11/23, 7:07 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:07 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
21/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 509 3519: So l must have supposed to pay $750 for the enrollment fee or the application fee and then if l apply alone l should have to pay $150-$200  on average?
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Arshita: No you have to pay $350 for enrollment fee
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Arshita: This
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
21/11/23, 7:16 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Yes
21/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 509 3519: OK but if you apply alone you pay $150-$200 on average?
21/11/23, 7:20 pm - Arshita: This is the payment plan
21/11/23, 8:11 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *11:30 pm CAT on Wednesday(22/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
22/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 509 3519: OK
22/11/23, 11:32 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*Your passion is waiting for your courage to catch up.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Yes
22/11/23, 12:23 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 509 3519: I am doing well
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 509 3519: OK what about the credit earned by the student in phase 2 if he/she wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per Edoofa
22/11/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/11/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: Are you not confident of these points?
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Yes
22/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 509 3519: I am confident
22/11/23, 1:11 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 509 3519: I think its up to stage 3
22/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: We have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
22/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
22/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
22/11/23, 1:42 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
22/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 509 3519: OK
22/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Yes
22/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 509 3519: What is the fee amount for the whole year excluding the registration fee
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Please answer this
22/11/23, 2:24 pm - Arshita: This is the fee
22/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 509 3519: Is the registration fee different from the enrollment fee?
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 509 3519: $2000-$3000
22/11/23, 2:32 pm - Arshita: Enrollment fee is $350
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - Arshita: Registration fee is this, it is a part of your tuition fee.
22/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 509 3519: OK ok
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
