22/11/23, 11:58 am - +265 996 40 67 62: Firstly I’d love to thank you for giving me this opportunity and sparing your time.

After several research, I came to light about Edoofa’s Scholarship program and how it  offers not only 50 but up to 100% scholarship. But mostly importantly I was intrigued with how it not only helps clear financial burden but helps provide employable education and a healthy and 
Sustainable environment to all including African countries as well.

The more knowledge I was able to acquire about Edoofa’s program, the more prompting and encouraging it was to apply because it seems to be the perfect fit or in line with my goals and dreams whilst helping with financial constraints that we face.
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I most definitely am looking forward to such a great opportunity
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Amazing
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Arshita: So now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why?*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)?*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far?*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad?*
*8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?*
*9. Your school name and province*
22/11/23, 1:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well. My name is Freda Mbozi. I was born on the third of April 2002. I am 21 years of age. I was born in a family of 3. However we have lived as an extended family of 8 for almost all my life. My father being the first born of his family, he is also is responsible for looking after his other 3 brothers hence totaling to 8 when I include my mother, older brother and little sister. As I was clocking towards 2014. I was lucky enough to be selected to a government school known as Chichiri Secondary School where I did my secondary school (high school) education and was able to complete in 2018. 2019 through the help of my family and other well wishers I started my Bachelor’s Degree program in Business Administration- Management at Malawi Adventist University though the fees gathered was only able to carter for two years. In my Second year I was able to find a part time job where I worked at Lagra Centre Branch as an Administrative assistant from Fridays to Sundays giving me a chance to attend classes during weekdays. Knowing the financial situation we had I would exceed the normal credit hours or courses I was required to take with three 3 extra courses of the upcoming semester on conditions that I do not fail even one course by our academic advisor and head of department which I fulfilled finishing in my 7th semester and not my 8th. I finished in august 2022 but my graduation occurred in July 2023.

My strengths would be how dedicated and passionate I am, honesty and hard work. My weakness would be that due to how much I pay attention to details it sometimes takes time to finish a task.
However during my free time I love getting to know people and places, reading, researching and hiking.

I would like to study Master’s in Business Administration. I would love to be given the chance to specialize in it.

My father is a Civil Engineer while my mother is a house wife who loves to work in the garden growing tomatoes and vegetables for consumption and sometimes sells. My parents highest level of education is a diploma.

And like I previously mentioned I come from a family of three. The first born is a boy Daniel, has a part time Job where he drives a mini truck of Chicken he sells. I am the second. And the last born who is a girl named Katrina is currently schooling in her secondary school education.

My biggest financial support has been my father though my brother would also contribute here and there.

If given the chance to proceed and do my further studies abroad . If at all there other part time jobs that would be helpful I’d be willing to do. But my father has been the biggest pillar throughout our lives.

The fees per semester in my university was $227 hence I was off campus. But in my secondary then it was $2 per term (from 2014-2018)
22/11/23, 1:11 pm - Arshita: Amazing to know more about you Freda! You are a true example of determination and hardwork! 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your JCE, MSCE and graduation results? 

Pictures will be better
22/11/23, 1:12 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. Let me do so
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I don’t know if you are aware but they removed JCE at some point then reinstated it
22/11/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: That is noted. 

You can share MSCE and graduation results.
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay thank you

22/11/23, 1:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you
22/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/11/23, 1:44 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I did. But I would love to enlighten more if there is a chance
22/11/23, 1:44 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I did research
22/11/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

22/11/23, 2:00 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: This has given me an insight thank you
22/11/23, 2:07 pm - Arshita: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests and passion, you are eligible to pursue

Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

22/11/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.

Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics

22/11/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

22/11/23, 3:15 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much. This is even more motivating
22/11/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
22/11/23, 3:30 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Looking at these amazing facts studying in India would be a great privilege and would put my career at a more strategical advantage for the great image and reputation it has. It would give a chance to improve in my career whilst allowing to remove financial constraints that would limit ones learning abilities
22/11/23, 3:30 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
22/11/23, 3:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes very aware. It is expensive without scholarship. Not everyone can be able to afford
22/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
22/11/23, 3:44 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: We can see that Edoofa is helping out quite a lot. And after discussion we would try as much as possible to fulfill the requirements
22/11/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I may not be fully aware but I am very willing to do so
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: This is great
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Not only will I be learning but this would also giving me an opportunity to expand my experience for every work is important and eventually comes in handy. So Earn while you learn program seems like a great opportunity
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow. This is really nice
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I definitely see how important it is
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
22/11/23, 4:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: All the points have their unique significance but 1 because without the right information the chances of most things going south are quite high
22/11/23, 4:06 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

22/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow.
22/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very nice
22/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Would it be possible to expand on number 4?
22/11/23, 4:12 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 4:12 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will assist you through all the process of form filling and visa application.
22/11/23, 4:19 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well my father and partially my brother
22/11/23, 4:19 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/11/23, 4:21 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. Thank you very much for sparing your time. This session has been eye opening and enlightening. I’ll be waiting
22/11/23, 4:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: My family has been nothing but supportive throughout. I’d love to thank them as well. More maybe you’d like it hear it from them?
22/11/23, 4:23 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
22/11/23, 4:23 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
22/11/23, 4:23 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
22/11/23, 4:24 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Sounds like a dream come true
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:25 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: When would these be needed?
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Understood
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow
22/11/23, 4:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: You may
22/11/23, 4:29 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/11/23, 4:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Sorry if I am ask, Considering that I already did my MSCE and hold a Degree how will this assist me?
22/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: You will be added to your admissions group and then also you will have your EWYL mentor you will be guiding you further.
22/11/23, 4:43 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If I am correct, we have covered 3 stages
22/11/23, 4:51 pm - Arshita: No Frenda, we have also discussed about enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
22/11/23, 4:54 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes this is true. My assumption there was more details since you talked about an EWYL mentor
22/11/23, 4:54 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: My apologies
22/11/23, 4:57 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
22/11/23, 4:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I am. thank you <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

How are you?
23/11/23, 12:37 pm - Austin#276: Dear parents, I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
23/11/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: We are pretty good and you
23/11/23, 12:38 pm - Austin#276: Good to know, I am doing well by the Grace of God!
23/11/23, 12:42 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: So far so good. If questions arise as the sessions progresses we will not hesitate to ask
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted!
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Austin#276: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Though as a country and citizens we are going through financial problems we would try as much as possible to meet our financial obligations plus the Earn as you learn program of yours would be helpful
23/11/23, 1:06 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: We wouldn't want our daughter to miss this Wonderful opportunity of the scholarship
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - Austin#276: I do understand the challenges and appreciate your willingness to invest in Freda's career
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - Austin#276: So Freda, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay. I would love to appreciate you for sparing your time.

The course that I would like to specialize in is Master’s in Business Administration.

The country that seemed to be more flexible considering the cost analysis and the amazing facts given was India.

As for the average costs. It was communicated that education without scholarship in India is $6000-$8000 which is quite expensive and not affordable to all including me.

The enrollment fee is $350. But if the student is found eligible, putting into consideration LWYE it is not paid within range of 7 days but rather $200 then completing the $150 within 30 days.

LWYE is one of most interesting and considerate procedures of Edoofa and how it is even considered as the backbone of Edoofa’s program. Here students are given online projects that help contribute to their scholarship credit that equal to physical cash. These credits help to pay off the fees making it more affordable. Not only that but there is no limit therefore the more efforts or online projects you are willing to do, the wider the chances of earning more credits helping release financial stress or burden. In addition to that it is also helping you expand intellectually because the more you learn the more knowledge you are acquiring.

Finally I am fully aware about the registration fee and how it would help me secure a spot and how it would on my first year’s annual fee. It is very clear. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - Austin#276: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes correct
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very true
23/11/23, 2:01 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:01 pm - Austin#276: Dear parents, @265999951305 @265999951302 Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: We would try as much as possible to source the fees pending on long does the eligibility check process take and after enrollment when does the schooling starts.
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Pending on how long
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Austin#276: If we begin the eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means, if Freda qualifies, the due date for the enrollment would fall towards the end of this month or early next month. Are you comfortable with this timeframe?
23/11/23, 3:18 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: Yes of course..

Gervais was also a part of the Education Summit hosted by our founders at Lilongwe in May this year.

25/11/23, 6:37 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Will definitely do that. Thanks
25/11/23, 6:37 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: After the session..
25/11/23, 6:40 pm - Austin#276: Sure, that would be fine
25/11/23, 6:40 pm - Austin#276: Are you clear with the mode of enrollment fee payment?
25/11/23, 6:43 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: It showed on the earlier communication though it will be our first time to do that transaction. Any extra elaboration would be welcome
25/11/23, 6:50 pm - Austin#276: Sure, you/your parents can visit the bank branch, fill out the telegraphic transfer form and deposit the amount. Ensure to click a picture of the stamped form and send it here. It would take 2-4 days for the bank to process your transaction and you will receive the SWIFT receipt. Due to the forex shortage in Malawi, the transfer may take time and I advise you to process it at the earliest to avoid delays.
