24/10/23, 7:50 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

*I am Ms. Arshita, career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us,  Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor  and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program . 

As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *11:30AM CAT Wednesday (25/10/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counselling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

25/10/23, 4:06 pm - Arshita: However Ncube, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 794 9812: okay ,noted
25/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 794 9812: understood, thank you ma'am
25/10/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 794 9812: great to hear, thank you
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 794 9812: lt is helpful
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 794 9812: Waiting for this message
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 794 9812: sorry 4
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: absolutely correct! 

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 794 9812: okay
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 794 9812: yes...I understood well
25/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 794 9812: so are we done ma'am
25/10/23, 4:26 pm - Arshita: Yes, we are done with stage 1, will inform you about the stage 2 soon.
25/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 794 9812: okay  .thank you🙏🏾
25/10/23, 6:13 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
25/10/23, 6:14 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
25/10/23, 6:14 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience
