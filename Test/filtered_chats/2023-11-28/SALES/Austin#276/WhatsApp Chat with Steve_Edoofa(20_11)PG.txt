20/11/23, 6:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
20/11/23, 6:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/11/23, 6:30 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Studying in India would allow me to see  the broader world as I would understand the Indian culture and how commerce could be affected by differently depending on different factors. I have also come to know that Indians have a helping spirit so studying in an environment filled with helpful and encouraging people would influence me a lot
20/11/23, 6:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Steve, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: So far from the information I have gathered from my friends, the tuition fees for higher education in India without a scholarship is around $6000
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Steve, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes it has indeed gone down by a lot and I feel it is affordable
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Steve!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 6:53 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: No, I am not aware of how it is done
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Steve, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

TIA Organics
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/11/23, 6:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I think this will be very beneficial for me and I am ready to do my best in order to earn the credits
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: This is very interesting to hear
20/11/23, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
20/11/23, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/11/23, 7:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I like the first point very much out of the four
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Expert Career Counseling*

20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: My parents will be assisting me with the remaining fee
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/11/23, 7:38 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: Yes I can confirm that as parents we will be able to pay the remaining fee. Thanks
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: As parents we are fine seeing him studying abroad. We give that consent. Thanks
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great to know, Mr. Steve, I am glad that you understand the importance of higher education abroad.
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Steve, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes that is all I have heard other than a visa application
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Please go ahead
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Steve, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 7:54 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I understand
20/11/23, 7:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: We are still on the first stage
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes please go ahead
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It is very clear
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

21/11/23, 4:21 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay
21/11/23, 4:22 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay thank you for the explanation

21/11/23, 4:23 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome!
21/11/23, 4:23 pm - Austin#276: Dalitso, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/11/23, 4:34 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: 1. I would be studying Bachelor of commerce through the Edoofa scholarship program 

2. Edoofa scholarship program helps students to get higher education in India

3. The average cost for studies in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year

4. The annual fee with the help of the Edoofa scholarship program ranges from $2000 to $3000. Though that can be reduced further due to my performance in the eligibility check procedure that will occur tomorrow 
 
5. The enrolment fee is $350 and it can be paid in two installments, firstly $200 in a time span of 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days

6. In my understanding of the Earn While Your Learn program, it is a program that encourages and provides students with a way to support themselves as a reward for their efforts. It is a program that allows a student to work with different brands so that they gain experience while learning. It is clear that there is no limit to the amount of credit one can earn through the program but it entirely depends on the performance of the student. The brands that work with the students through the EWYL program can also hire the student after they are through with their education.

7. Yes, I understand it very well.

24/11/23, 3:57 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Could you please explain it to me
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - Austin#276: Are you planning to pay from Malawi or from any other country?
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: From Malawi
24/11/23, 4:14 pm - Austin#276: In that case, you/your parents can visit bank branch, fill out the telegraphic transfer form and deposit the amount. Ensure to click a picture of the stamped form and send it here. It would take 2-4 days for the bank to process your transaction and you will receive the SWIFT receipt. Due to forex shortage in Malawi, the transfer may take time and I advise you to process it at the earliest to avoid delays.
24/11/23, 4:49 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: This is noted. We will do the telegraphic transfer early next week. Ofcourse we are also trying to find an alternative of outside the country. Thanks
24/11/23, 4:51 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, Mr Dalitso!
That would be fine, if you have an international card, you can pay through our website as well. This can be done from other countries as well

24/11/23, 4:53 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: Ok. I only have a VISA card
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Austin#276: You can try with the VISA card if online transaction is activated by your bank. Parents from Malawi use this mode of transaction as well.
24/11/23, 5:01 pm - +265 888 35 24 25: Sure! This is noted and will try this option too.
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Austin#276: Sure, that would be fine
