We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/11/23, 13:04 - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/11/23, 13:19 - +263 71 732 4720: Yea
21/11/23, 13:24 - Harmehak: Did you go through the document Ozias?

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?

21/11/23, 19:11 - Harmehak: That's great
21/11/23, 19:12 - Harmehak: You are required to address these questions if you understand, Ozias

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
21/11/23, 19:13 - +263 71 732 4720: Yu want me to say things that i read or my own thoughts
21/11/23, 19:16 - Harmehak: What you read and learnt from the document, Ozias.
21/11/23, 19:29 - +263 71 732 4720: I learn that yu will be paid while learning
21/11/23, 20:19 - Harmehak: Did you understand the following?
21/11/23, 20:19 - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 20:20 - +263 71 732 4720: Yaaa i understood
21/11/23, 20:24 - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you $1500 a year?
21/11/23, 20:26 - +263 71 732 4720: Year they will help
21/11/23, 20:27 - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
21/11/23, 20:28 - +263 71 732 4720: What do you mean
21/11/23, 20:28 - Harmehak: Can you properly answer this question for me, Ozias?
21/11/23, 20:29 - +263 71 732 4720: They will help
21/11/23, 20:29 - Harmehak: Alright, so do discuss with them today once again and request them to acknowledge their support in the group as well.
21/11/23, 20:30 - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
22/11/23, 09:04 - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 09:26 - +263 71 732 4720: Yea
22/11/23, 09:30 - +263 71 732 4720: How are you
22/11/23, 09:46 - Harmehak: Did you discuss regarding the financial support with your parents, Ozias?
22/11/23, 09:52 - +263 71 732 4720: Yea we did it
22/11/23, 09:53 - Harmehak: That's great,

Can they participate in the discussion and acknowledge the same, Ozias?
22/11/23, 09:58 - +263 71 732 4720: Ok let me tell them
22/11/23, 10:01 - Harmehak: Sure please
22/11/23, 10:03 - Harmehak: Ozias, you mentioned your parents don't work,

So who would be the one supporting you financially?
22/11/23, 10:04 - +263 71 732 4720: They dont have a straight job... So they will support me using money from piece jobs
22/11/23, 10:09 - Harmehak: Alright please
22/11/23, 10:09 - Harmehak: When did you complete your A level please?
22/11/23, 10:13 - +263 71 732 4720: This year
22/11/23, 10:23 - Harmehak: You mean this November please?
22/11/23, 10:23 - +263 71 732 4720: Yes
22/11/23, 10:25 - Harmehak: Alright please
22/11/23, 10:25 - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 10:31 - +263 71 732 4720: Yaaa i am
22/11/23, 10:38 - Harmehak: Wonderful, so, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Business Administration?
22/11/23, 10:41 - +263 71 732 4720: Not home now but if yu dont mind if i write them down
