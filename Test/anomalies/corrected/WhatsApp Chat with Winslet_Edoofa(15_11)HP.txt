15/11/23, 19:52 - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

24/11/23, 09:30 - +263 78 271 7108: If you have any questions I have some time to spare, you may ask me
24/11/23, 09:35 - Harmehak: I am doing well please

Have you been able to follow the discussion so far?
24/11/23, 09:42 - +263 78 271 7108: Ye I have
24/11/23, 09:42 - +263 78 271 7108: Very progressive
24/11/23, 09:48 - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
24/11/23, 10:46 - +263 78 271 7108: In the event that she gets selected, hopefully, in terms of accommodation where exactly would she staying for the duration of the semester or learning period
24/11/23, 10:48 - +263 78 271 7108: Will she be able to get the specific programs she wishes to study and what are the academic requirements in terms of for example the points at A level
24/11/23, 10:53 - Harmehak: Sure, let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
24/11/23, 10:53 - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/11/23, 10:58 - +263 78 271 7108: Thank you so much that was very clear
24/11/23, 10:59 - +263 78 271 7108: I understand that’s very clear as well
24/11/23, 10:59 - +263 78 271 7108: This was very helpful thank you
24/11/23, 11:03 - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
24/11/23, 11:04 - Harmehak: Mr McRomeo, do you understand the following too please?
24/11/23, 11:04 - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/11/23, 11:19 - +263 78 271 7108: Yes I understand
24/11/23, 11:38 - Harmehak: So as parents are you willing to support Winslet 's higher education in India mentally and financially please?
24/11/23, 11:48 - +263 78 271 7108: Yes we are willing, we think that it’s a very big opportunity for her and we will support her both mentally and financially
24/11/23, 12:00 - Harmehak: Its great to see that you are supportive, Mr McRomeo.
24/11/23, 12:01 - Harmehak: She managed to share her interests in pursuing Actuarial sciences,

Are you aware of the same?
24/11/23, 12:13 - +263 78 271 7108: Yes I am aware
24/11/23, 12:20 - Harmehak: Alright please
24/11/23, 12:20 - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
