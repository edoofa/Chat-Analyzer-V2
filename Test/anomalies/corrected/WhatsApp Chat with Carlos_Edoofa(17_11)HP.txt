*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Carlos Runesu.

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
16/11/23, 20:50 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

17/11/23, 09:58 - +263 77 700 0450: Sure

17/11/23, 10:38 - Harmehak: So did you go through the shared video Yesterday?
17/11/23, 10:50 - +263 77 700 0450: Its very unfortunate that the video is not yet downloaded.  My network connection is so weak.
17/11/23, 10:50 - +263 77 700 0450: No
17/11/23, 10:50 - Harmehak: I can understand Carlos
17/11/23, 10:51 - Harmehak: Carlos, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Valerie!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
17/11/23, 10:51 - +263 77 700 0450: Edoo
17/11/23, 10:52 - Harmehak: Excuse me?
17/11/23, 10:54 - +263 77 700 0450: Edoofa is said to be a reliable source of scholarship as per my friend's points. He gave some examples of students who had done it through your program. So he brought me a connection to you.
17/11/23, 10:54 - +263 77 700 0450: And due to my belief l decided to contact u
17/11/23, 10:58 - Harmehak: That's great
17/11/23, 10:58 - Harmehak: Well received, Carlos, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/11/23, 10:58 - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
17/11/23, 11:05 - +263 77 700 0450: Yeah thats great deeds.
17/11/23, 11:05 - +263 77 700 0450: So what stages shall l suppose to follow in getting a scholarship?
17/11/23, 11:12 - Harmehak: I would discuss everything with you.
17/11/23, 11:12 - Harmehak: *Alright so Carlos, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
17/11/23, 15:13 - +263 77 700 0450: Oh well. 
My name is Carlos Runesu. A first born of 2 sons to my father and mother,  2 half brothers. My mom and dad divorced. So due to that, l end up attending many schools from rural to urban areas visa-a-vis. However it helped me to copy with both situations- of rural and urban. My father is a part time driver and my mother is a housewife. We all depend on my father's little salary. However at times when l am not occupied l go for part time jobs to support on household needs. 
Academically, l have 5 ordinary level subjects which include 2 Science subs and 2 language subjects and a humanitarian subject. 
Proceeded to Advanced level and l was doing a collection of History , Shona Literature and Geography. I included English communication skills as it was compulsory at my high school. 
I wrote my Ordinary level at Bhamala secondary school, in Kwekwe rural. My advanced level was at Domboramwari high in Harare East. 
My main concern is proceed to acquire a diploma, and proceed as well if its possible to attain a degree, specifically in any Humanitarian industry. This is due to the fact that l can manage humanitarian subjects and programs. I acquired ten points at advanced level. 5 points in Literature in Shona, 4 points in History and a point in Geography as welm as a pass in AO English communication skills. 
I am interested in doing Tourism and hospitality management if Human resources management is quite tricky.
17/11/23, 15:13 - +263 77 700 0450: I find it difficult to explain and explore my favourite hobby. This is may due to the fact that l tend to be a public figure and end up being multi-talented. I play soccer, handball, volleyball and learning basketball now. Am also a chess player however with intermediate skills.
17/11/23, 15:13 - +263 77 700 0450: Religiously, l was baptized and now a member of Christ family
17/11/23, 15:13 - +263 77 700 0450: Currently l.am working as a part time security guard, gardener, socialite to raise funds to proceed with my career projects and programs.
17/11/23, 15:58 - Harmehak: Well received Carlos, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself.

It's great to see that you all have been making combined efforts to do well and support the family.
17/11/23, 15:59 - +263 77 700 0450: Sure
17/11/23, 16:13 - Harmehak: Well Carlos, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
17/11/23, 16:18 - +263 77 700 0450: Yeah, l do believe.
17/11/23, 16:33 - Harmehak: Alright and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
17/11/23, 19:43 - +263 77 700 0450: 😀😀of course...
17/11/23, 19:46 - +263 77 700 0450: Ms Harmehak, l forgot to ask about documents. Passports or visas and staff🤔😀😀
17/11/23, 19:56 - Harmehak: What would you like to know regarding them?
17/11/23, 20:49 - +263 77 700 0450: I haven't yet acquired a visa or a passport. Will Edoofa work it out for me. Or l must make the process quicker at the offices
17/11/23, 20:51 - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in detail tomorrow at 9 AM CAT.

Meanwhile do go through the shared document, please.
17/11/23, 20:51 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 20:51 - +263 77 700 0450: Ok.
17/11/23, 21:26 - +263 77 700 0450: Well l have gone through the information in the file you send. I understand now.
18/11/23, 09:06 - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/11/23, 12:35 - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you during the session however I understand there must be some reason due to which you were unable to get back to me.

I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT* since already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
18/11/23, 18:24 - +263 77 700 0450: My apology Miss.
18/11/23, 18:25 - +263 77 700 0450: I had left my phone by mistake so l spent the day without it.
18/11/23, 18:25 - +263 77 700 0450: May you be lenient to me.
18/11/23, 18:39 - Harmehak: I understand
18/11/23, 18:40 - +263 77 700 0450: Ooh thank you. Its very rare to find such care in circumstances like this
18/11/23, 18:41 - +263 77 700 0450: So we can proceed.
18/11/23, 18:41 - Harmehak: We shall connect on Monday to proceed with the counseling session itself.
18/11/23, 18:41 - Harmehak: However, did you go through the document?
18/11/23, 18:42 - +263 77 700 0450: Yeah l did. I understand.
18/11/23, 18:42 - Harmehak: Alright please
18/11/23, 18:42 - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
18/11/23, 18:48 - +263 77 700 0450: 1. Edoofa isn't a charity program therefore one cannot fully depend on a full scholarship since there are limited seats. Edoofa only offers 2500 seats. And 1500 are reserved for African students.  Edoofa choose lndia as the base to study abroad since the country has 28 states and the schools are cheaper compared to those in Europe, particularly Canada and USA. The funds by Edoofa are sponsored by a board which raise $1m. The main agenda of Edoofa is the employability of skills a student has learned... Thats it in my briefing
18/11/23, 18:49 - +263 77 700 0450: 2. I have answered part of question 2 as well.
18/11/23, 18:49 - +263 77 700 0450: Am l not lost.😀
18/11/23, 18:50 - Harmehak: Very correct, Carlos!

Did you understand the following?
18/11/23, 18:50 - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/11/23, 18:53 - +263 77 700 0450: I hope to do well.
18/11/23, 18:53 - +263 77 700 0450: Waiting for Monday...
18/11/23, 18:57 - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
18/11/23, 19:00 - +263 77 700 0450: Sorry... Come again
18/11/23, 19:10 - Harmehak: Did you follow this message regarding the finances?
18/11/23, 19:11 - +263 77 700 0450: Yep l did go through everything
18/11/23, 19:20 - Harmehak: So did you discuss the finances with your parents?
18/11/23, 21:04 - +263 77 700 0450: They are still doubting the program. But mom told me to be in touch with you
18/11/23, 21:16 - +263 77 700 0450: And she told me to inform her on the procedures you are going to take with me
20/11/23, 09:49 - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 09:50 - Harmehak: I didn't get you please?

20/11/23, 20:26 - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you with $2000 a year?

20/11/23, 20:33 - +263 77 700 0450: I mean l must have that 2000$,??? What's the main purpose of this??
20/11/23, 20:33 - +263 77 700 0450: Is it just to keep with me during the tour of my study or to add to my provision by Edoofa??
20/11/23, 20:36 - Harmehak: Before I address,

Did you understand that the fee comes down from $8000 to $2000-3000 a year, which includes Tuition fee, Accomodation, Food and Basic university expenses?
20/11/23, 20:37 - +263 77 700 0450: Yes
20/11/23, 20:37 - Harmehak: What do you understand regarding the financial aspect now?
20/11/23, 20:39 - +263 77 700 0450: Edoofa is there just to cut or.decrease the costs. I must pay for the 2000$ a day. However there is the program, Earn while learning, which will contribute to my payments
20/11/23, 20:41 - Harmehak: Indeed,

However you don't pay $2000 one day!

That's your annual fee (a year's fee which is $2000-3000)
20/11/23, 21:02 - +263 77 700 0450: So how??
20/11/23, 21:02 - +263 77 700 0450: I.am failing to get it well here

22/11/23, 10:45 - +263 77 700 0450: Am.away now on a work project. I need time and eye contact to tell her this
22/11/23, 10:52 - Harmehak: I can understand.

What is your understanding of the financial aspect so far?
22/11/23, 11:05 - +263 77 700 0450: I have to pay for my fees. However if grace locates me, learn while earning is going to cover for some expenses. Edoofa is offering 50% to full scholarship. Edoofa also helps to reduce study cost from $8000 to $2000 per year
22/11/23, 11:12 - Harmehak: Correct.

So are your parents willing to support you financially, Carlos?
22/11/23, 11:46 - +263 77 700 0450: Literally, not sure
22/11/23, 12:21 - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
22/11/23, 16:13 - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
23/11/23, 09:07 - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
