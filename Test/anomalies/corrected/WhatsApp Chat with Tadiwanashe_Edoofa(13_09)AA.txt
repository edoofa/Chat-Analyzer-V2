How are you doing?
15/09/23, 12:13 - +263 77 745 0176: I am still researching
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
15/09/23, 12:17 - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

18/09/23, 10:32 - Arshita: Good to know that! 

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
18/09/23, 10:36 - +263 77 745 0176: I am not
18/09/23, 10:36 - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/09/23, 10:37 - Arshita: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 10:37 - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
18/09/23, 10:41 - +263 77 745 0176: Does it mean that scholarship pays 2000-3000 out of 6000- 8000. And the student will pay the balance?
18/09/23, 10:46 - Arshita: After scholarship the cost to be paid is $2000-$3000.
18/09/23, 10:47 - Arshita: I hope we are on the same page now.
18/09/23, 10:51 - +263 77 745 0176: Ok i understand
18/09/23, 10:54 - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
18/09/23, 13:05 - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:40 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

18/09/23, 13:42 - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
18/09/23, 14:14 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes we can
18/09/23, 14:14 - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
18/09/23, 14:14 - +263 77 745 0176: No i dont know how
18/09/23, 14:14 - +263 77 745 0176: No
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
18/09/23, 14:15 - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
19/09/23, 09:50 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes we can continue
19/09/23, 09:58 - Arshita: Greetings ! 

How are you doing?
19/09/23, 09:58 - +263 77 745 0176: I am ok and how are you
19/09/23, 10:04 - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
19/09/23, 10:04 - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
19/09/23, 10:31 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes
19/09/23, 10:33 - Arshita: Please answer this
19/09/23, 10:36 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes i think he will benefit a lot since he will be helping us to secure his fees. And also to gain work  experience
19/09/23, 10:39 - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
19/09/23, 10:39 - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 10:46 - +263 77 745 0176: Ok i understood
19/09/23, 10:46 - +263 77 745 0176: Its now clear
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/09/23, 10:52 - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
19/09/23, 11:01 - +263 77 745 0176: No 4
19/09/23, 11:02 - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

19/09/23, 11:03 - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hardwork.
19/09/23, 11:06 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes i focus more on quality education
19/09/23, 11:06 - +263 77 745 0176: Ok
19/09/23, 11:07 - Arshita: Good to hear that!
19/09/23, 11:07 - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
19/09/23, 11:10 - +263 77 745 0176: Thank you for guidance. Its my first time to hear about this.
19/09/23, 11:10 - +263 77 745 0176: What is the duration of the program
19/09/23, 11:16 - Arshita: 3 years
19/09/23, 11:16 - Arshita: I hope we are on the same page now.
19/09/23, 11:19 - +263 77 745 0176: Yes we are now on the same page
19/09/23, 11:24 - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
19/09/23, 11:24 - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/09/23, 11:24 - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 11:24 - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
19/09/23, 12:06 - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
19/09/23, 12:12 - +263 77 745 0176: Not yet i am doing some work right now may need time to go through
19/09/23, 12:13 - Arshita: I can understand that! 

Let me know once you have gone through it.
