I am *Ms. Pallika*, and I am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Persistance* from Zimbabwe


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *12:30 PM CAT tomorrow (20/11/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
