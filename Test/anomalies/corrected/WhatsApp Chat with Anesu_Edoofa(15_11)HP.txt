15/11/23, 16:42 - Harmehak: Good Afternoon, I hope this finds you well,

*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Mandebvu Anesu T.

I hope I have contacted the right person?
15/11/23, 16:46 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes you have
15/11/23, 16:47 - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
15/11/23, 16:49 - +263 71 139 0333: How are you all
15/11/23, 16:50 - Harmehak: I am doing well please

How are you?
15/11/23, 16:54 - +263 71 139 0333: I'm good
15/11/23, 16:55 - Harmehak: Anesu, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Panashe!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
15/11/23, 16:58 - +263 71 139 0333: I learnt that it's a program that gives full and partial scholarship to students around the world.The scholarships are for schools in India
15/11/23, 16:59 - Harmehak: Well received, Anesu, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 16:59 - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
15/11/23, 17:06 - +263 71 139 0333: Oh I didn't know you collaborated with schools here in Zimbabwe.i thought you just gave scholarships
15/11/23, 17:06 - Harmehak: Isn't it exciting to know the same now, Anesu?
15/11/23, 17:08 - +263 71 139 0333: It is
15/11/23, 17:14 - Harmehak: Wonderful,

So now may I know your understanding of a full scholarship?
15/11/23, 17:18 - +263 71 139 0333: Full amount of school fees is paid for you and everything you will need while studying will be provided.Plane tickets will be paid for too.
15/11/23, 17:23 - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
15/11/23, 17:25 - +263 71 139 0333: Oh I understand now
15/11/23, 17:26 - +263 71 139 0333: So this is a scholarships not a sponsorship.i get it now
15/11/23, 17:30 - Harmehak: Yes please
15/11/23, 17:30 - Harmehak: *Alright so Anesu, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Chaplin high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
15/11/23, 17:42 - +263 71 139 0333: I'm 16 years old turning 17 next year.I'm currently in lower 6 at Chaplin high School doing Maths,Physics and Computer Science.Chaplin's full school fees is 120 USD per term.I'm very good in all Computer related things.My hobbies include computer programming and 3d modelling on computers.I guess my weakness is I'm not very social but I am when I'm required to be.We are 7 in our family.my mother,father, brother and three younger sisters.My father and mother are both in the educational sector.They are all teachers.My father holds a Master's degree and my mother has a diploma
15/11/23, 17:50 - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Anesu, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
15/11/23, 17:51 - +263 71 139 0333: Thanks
15/11/23, 17:57 - Harmehak: Well Anesu now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
15/11/23, 18:03 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes.I believe it is as it's a Chance for me to broaden my view and experience new things and I heard that there are more courses offered abroad than the amount offered in Zimbabwe.
15/11/23, 18:10 - Harmehak: That's great, Anesu 

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
15/11/23, 18:17 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes I am
15/11/23, 18:18 - Harmehak: That's good,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
15/11/23, 18:22 - +263 71 139 0333: They are
15/11/23, 18:24 - Harmehak: Could you please share more about your financial support, Anesu?
15/11/23, 18:28 - +263 71 139 0333: Both my Father and mother support are the ones who support me financially with their salaries from teaching
15/11/23, 18:39 - Harmehak: Its great to know that they are supportive, Anesu.
15/11/23, 18:39 - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/11/23, 18:40 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes I am
15/11/23, 18:41 - Harmehak: I am glad
15/11/23, 18:42 - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study degree related to computer?
15/11/23, 18:45 - +263 71 139 0333: Should I send a copy of the document or just say my results
15/11/23, 18:50 - Harmehak: Either would be alright please.
15/11/23, 18:51 - +263 71 139 0333: My motivation behind wanting to study computer related degrees is that I love working with computers and am always eager to learn more about computers and their application and how to use them to their maximum capacity.Even now I have already started studying what they learn in universities
15/11/23, 18:52 - Harmehak: Well that's good, Anesu.

15/11/23, 20:22 - Harmehak: That is really great Anesu, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/11/23, 20:28 - +263 71 139 0333: Another part of studying in university includes going on attachments and gaining real experience.In Zimbabwe there aren't many companies or jobs related to Computer Science but that is not the case in India.There I can gain practical experience while doing my attachment in reputable companies.
15/11/23, 20:32 - Harmehak: You see, Anesu, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 20:38 - +263 71 139 0333: More Challenging than here?
15/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage.*

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.
15/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: Along with the same, I would also be sharing a video for you to learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
15/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 20:51 - +263 71 139 0333: Thanks.about 10am, sorry but I'll be at school tomorrow,I have an exam but from 2oclock I will be home

16/11/23, 15:42 - Harmehak: So did you go through the shared video, Yesterday?
16/11/23, 15:55 - +263 71 139 0333: I only went through half of it that downloaded
16/11/23, 15:56 - Harmehak: I do understand,

How was your experience?
16/11/23, 15:57 - +263 71 139 0333: It was good I learnt more about the program through the video
16/11/23, 15:58 - Harmehak: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 15:58 - Harmehak: That things are more challenging in Zimbabwe.
16/11/23, 15:58 - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Anesu

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

16/11/23, 16:07 - +263 71 139 0333: So the CEOs of many renowned companies especially tech ones came from india.they must have high quality education too to be able to produce even CEOs of companies like Microsoft adobe and Nokia
16/11/23, 16:13 - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Anesu!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 16:13 - Harmehak: Very correct
16/11/23, 16:14 - +263 71 139 0333: No we aren't
16/11/23, 16:15 - Harmehak: I understand
16/11/23, 16:15 - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 16:15 - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 16:15 - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 16:15 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 16:16 - +263 71 139 0333: Ok it's indeed much cheaper
16/11/23, 16:17 - Harmehak: In simple words Anesu, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/11/23, 16:17 - +263 71 139 0333: I also heard that from others
16/11/23, 16:18 - Harmehak: That's great
16/11/23, 16:19 - Harmehak: Anesu, from Mr Piyush' experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 16:20 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes it costs even more here
16/11/23, 16:24 - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now having gone through the cost are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Given the opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program as well.
16/11/23, 16:24 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes I have
16/11/23, 16:25 - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 16:25 - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 16:25 - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 16:25 - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 16:25 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 16:32 - +263 71 139 0333: I think I have understood most of the EWYL program.so these credits will help in the financing of your education and further reduce the costs
16/11/23, 16:32 - Harmehak: Yes please, Anesu!
16/11/23, 16:32 - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 16:33 - +263 71 139 0333: That's good then
16/11/23, 16:35 - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 16:39 - +263 71 139 0333: So with enough hard work and persistence you can basically pay for your tuition yourself
16/11/23, 16:39 - Harmehak: Very correct, Anesu
16/11/23, 16:40 - +263 71 139 0333: That's good then
16/11/23, 16:41 - Harmehak: Indeed, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 16:42 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes
16/11/23, 16:42 - Harmehak: Anesu, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 16:42 - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 16:43 - +263 71 139 0333: A lot about 1800
16/11/23, 16:45 - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 16:45 - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 16:45 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 16:45 - Harmehak: Anesu, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 16:46 - +263 71 139 0333: I think so too
16/11/23, 16:47 - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 16:47 - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 16:47 - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 16:48 - +263 71 139 0333: Ok I understand
16/11/23, 16:49 - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 16:49 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 16:49 - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 16:49 - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 16:51 - +263 71 139 0333: Do you mean we can start the earn while you learn program before going to india
16/11/23, 16:53 - Harmehak: Very correct, Anesu.

For more than a year, you  would be earning credits before coming to India, which is one of the many benefits.
16/11/23, 16:53 - +263 71 139 0333: Ok I have understood
16/11/23, 16:54 - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 16:54 - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 16:54 - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 16:54 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 16:56 - +263 71 139 0333: Ok I understand now
16/11/23, 17:00 - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 17:00 - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 17:00 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 17:05 - +263 71 139 0333: Let me contact her now
16/11/23, 17:07 - Harmehak: Sure please, Anesu!
16/11/23, 17:08 - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 17:08 - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 17:08 - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

17/11/23, 12:46 - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
17/11/23, 16:19 - +263 71 139 0333: Hie.sorry but I was busy at school.can we start with the eligibility check evaluation now
17/11/23, 17:01 - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
17/11/23, 17:08 - +263 71 139 0333: Yes she answered all my questions
17/11/23, 17:11 - +263 71 139 0333: Effectively
17/11/23, 17:50 - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
17/11/23, 17:52 - +263 71 139 0333: We haven't had the chance yet.but I was in the process
17/11/23, 17:55 - +263 71 139 0333: At school we aren't allowed our phones and we finish up at 3.00 and I'm usually home by 3.40.
17/11/23, 17:56 - +263 71 139 0333: Right now she isn't online
17/11/23, 18:08 - Sahil Edoofa: Please request your parents to continue the interview in your absence.
17/11/23, 18:08 - Sahil Edoofa: Your parents can call her Directly.
17/11/23, 18:09 - +263 71 139 0333: Let me request them now
17/11/23, 18:10 - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
17/11/23, 18:10 - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
17/11/23, 18:11 - +263 77 618 8265: I am Anesu"s father. Hope you are well. Thank you for considering my son.
17/11/23, 18:17 - +263 71 139 0333: Course: Computer Science

17/11/23, 18:17 - Sahil Edoofa: Welcome @263776188265
17/11/23, 18:17 - Sahil Edoofa: @263776188265 Are you ready for the same ?
17/11/23, 18:19 - +263 77 618 8265: Yes
17/11/23, 18:22 - +263 77 618 8265: But it's my wish to have full scholarship
17/11/23, 18:22 - +263 77 618 8265: Noted
17/11/23, 19:45 - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/11/23, 19:45 - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

17/11/23, 19:45 - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd November 2023 for $200 and the 22nd or 23rd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
17/11/23, 20:13 - +263 77 618 8265: He is in form 5 now. He will sit for his final A Level examinations next year in November. Are we to pay as per your dates in such a scenario?
17/11/23, 20:32 - +263 77 618 8265: I can borrow the $200
17/11/23, 20:34 - Sahil Edoofa: Reserved seats in advance allow you to initiate the Earn While You Learn program in your home country. This step-by-step approach provides you and your family with the opportunity to plan systematically, avoiding undue financial burdens. Over the span of approximately 20 months, engaging in projects through the EWYL program could potentially yield $50-$100 monthly. This strategic financial approach enables you to self-finance the entirety of your fees before commencing your education, thereby alleviating the financial burden on your family.
17/11/23, 20:36 - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same? Can you please answer using voice notes .
18/11/23, 06:57 - Sahil Edoofa: Let us connect again at *10:00 am CAT today* to continue the session with a fresh mind. Make sure to show your *active participation in the session* as it is an important parameter to evaluate your application.
18/11/23, 11:23 - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
18/11/23, 15:05 - +263 77 618 8265: How are you today?
18/11/23, 15:14 - Sahil Edoofa: Canyou please answer this ?
18/11/23, 15:55 - +263 77 618 8265: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 18:42 - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Anesu's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Anesu's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
18/11/23, 20:53 - +263 77 618 8265: Can I have details to post $100 within 7 days. I will try.
19/11/23, 20:53 - Sahil Edoofa: Let us reconvene for our session tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time with a fresh and focused mindset to continue our discussion. Your active participation in the session is an important parameter for evaluating your application.
