For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

24/11/23, 15:38 - +265 883 86 01 04: Sorry to ask why isn't there any black alumni
24/11/23, 15:45 - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, Please elaborate on this for me as I am unable to understand!!
24/11/23, 15:59 - +265 883 86 01 04: Alright, what am saying is all the photos that you've sent me are all white people. The black people aren't they successful after schooling at Edoofa
24/11/23, 16:02 - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, India has a rich history and has produced numerous influential individuals who have made significant contributions on the global stage. While the term "Black people" typically refers to individuals of African descent, India's diaspora has extended to various parts of the world, with Indian leaders making an impact globally.

*Satya Nadella:*

Indra Nooyi:

Background: Born in Chennai, India.

*Nikesh Arora:*

*Padmasree Warrior:*

These leaders, among others, showcase the global impact of Indian talent and leadership across diverse sectors.
24/11/23, 16:04 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As mentioned above, we have a community of more than 4,000 Edoofians that cam from Africa and doing wonders her in India and self financing their own higher education by earning the scholarship credits by doing Hard work
24/11/23, 16:07 - +265 883 86 01 04: Still doesn't answer my question!! Why not put them up on the poster to show the world how successful they've become . Why the light skinned?
24/11/23, 16:27 - Pallika Edoofa: Diane, If you observe the poster titles, they are of Indian origins, which means, people who were born in India. The migration to India started a few years ago and it has only been a few years since African learners realized the value of the Indian Education System and have been utilizing the opportunity to secure the best exposure. Securing a citizenship in India, would take a long time and this is the reason we are yet to have them on the posters of India origin. But if you are looking at successful African learners who graduated from India, the best example would be the honourable First Lady of Zimbabwe who is the first African to secure a PhD from India. So you see, it is a treasure that has been discovered recently.
24/11/23, 16:27 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 16:27 - Pallika Edoofa: You will have the success stories of African learners and they will be in the leading roles in the coming times.
24/11/23, 16:27 - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa Scholarship Program will be a catalyst for this change. I  believe you are looking for such an opportunity for your career.
24/11/23, 16:32 - +265 883 86 01 04: Thank you very much this is what I wanted
24/11/23, 16:32 - Pallika Edoofa: You're most welcome, Diane
24/11/23, 16:33 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 16:34 - +265 883 86 01 04: No they are not
24/11/23, 16:34 - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/11/23, 16:34 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 17:01 - +265 883 86 01 04: That's like 5.4M I don't think my sister can manage
24/11/23, 17:02 - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Diane!!

 let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
24/11/23, 17:02 - +265 883 86 01 04: Please enlighten me
24/11/23, 17:07 - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Diane, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
