24/11/23, 12:04 - Arshita: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly.

In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later. Let me know the names with which I should address them.

I am Ms Arshita, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions at Edoofa

We have received the application of Peter for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counselling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
24/11/23, 13:39 - Arshita: Peter, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Shalom?*
24/11/23, 17:23 - +263 78 113 9393: 1) l found out that this program was giving schorlaships to kuds all around  Africa  countries and other countries outside Africa.  By this l saw that l had a chance to proceed  with my education from A -level to tertiary education with lesser costs which will relieve my parents . Also since this scholarship leads to india , it is my chance to get out of my mother country and learn about other diverse cultures which will help me with my socialisation techniques .
24/11/23, 17:25 - +263 78 113 9393: 2)I believe studying abroad will help me in socialisation with various people from various countries thereby there will be exchange of various knowledge and culture which l believe a geographer has to take part in.
