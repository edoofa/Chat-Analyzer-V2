14/11/23, 16:40 - +263 77 623 2165: For it's a dream come true if I am grantedthe opportunity to learn in India and become a successful person globally
14/11/23, 16:40 - +263 77 623 2165: *for me
14/11/23, 16:42 - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
14/11/23, 16:42 - +263 77 623 2165: We are not familiar with the cost of paying higher education abroad
14/11/23, 16:44 - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/11/23, 16:45 - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/11/23, 16:45 - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/11/23, 16:45 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 16:46 - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/11/23, 16:46 - Tushti: In simple words Panashe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/11/23, 16:48 - +263 77 623 2165: Reduction of the fee is good
14/11/23, 16:49 - +263 77 623 2165: Can I ask a question Ms Tushti if you mind
14/11/23, 17:37 - Tushti: Yes please

15/11/23, 10:01 - +263 77 623 2165: Yes please
15/11/23, 10:02 - Tushti: I am well, thank you! Let's start the session <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 10:02 - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/11/23, 10:02 - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/11/23, 10:02 - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/11/23, 10:03 - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/11/23, 10:08 - +263 77 623 2165: Indeed it is Ms Tushti this is a good offer for sure
15/11/23, 10:15 - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
15/11/23, 10:15 - Tushti: Panashe,  as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/11/23, 10:22 - +263 77 623 2165: The cost will range between $1500- $2500
15/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: Exactly Panashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/11/23, 10:23 - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/11/23, 10:23 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 10:23 - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/11/23, 10:26 - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree with the program and how it has helped the alot of family to afford the fee
15/11/23, 10:26 - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/11/23, 10:26 - Tushti: Panashe, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/11/23, 10:26 - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/11/23, 10:26 - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
15/11/23, 10:29 - +263 77 623 2165: I do understand the terms Ms Tushti
15/11/23, 10:30 - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
15/11/23, 10:30 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 10:30 - Tushti: Alright Panashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
15/11/23, 10:30 - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/11/23, 10:30 - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/11/23, 10:35 - +263 77 623 2165: Yes, I definitely did thank you Ms Tushti
15/11/23, 10:38 - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/11/23, 10:38 - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/11/23, 10:38 - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/11/23, 10:38 - Tushti: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/11/23, 10:39 - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/11/23, 10:39 - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
15/11/23, 10:39 - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING

TOPIC : What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?


After the 16th anniversary of the start of Rwanda's genocide,three months of brutality in which an estimated 1, 000 000 people were killed. As previously written Rwanda has rebuilt itself in the aftermath of the tragedy, setting itself apart from other developing nations by intelligently, efficiently and transparently making the most of other nations investments and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social service, entrepreneurship, and basic infrastructure.

From AIDS to family health, you'd be hard pressed to find a nation that's shown better results for the money spent in improving health care fundamentals. Nevertheless, getting those basics right are only the foundation of the nation's broader plan to become a middle- income country by 2020. Rwanda intends to be on par with Brazil, Thailand, and other nations that pulled themselves out of poverty in recent decades.


This country has certainly come further I the past 16 years than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted. All of this development is important to recognize because it has been the government's express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to it's people in order to mitigate genocide ideology. Five years ago  travelling anywhere in the country was bound to be a bumpy ride. If the way was even passable. Recently east to west and north to south, the road infrastructure is impressive and continues to expand.


Five years ago, the country struggled to get tourists in for $375 permits to visit Rwanda's mountain gorilla.Recently, during highly season , there are not enough $500 tickets to meet the demand. The past five years there were no super markets or ATMs and the cheapest cell phones cost $50. Recently there are multiple super markets over a dozen international ATMs and cell phones that cost $14 are plentiful. 


Moreover there access to electricity and running water inconsistent five years ago even for those who could pay for it is being constantly improved. In Lake Kivu, which borders Rwanda to the west, an American company, Contour Global, is building one of the world's largest methane extractors. Hotels are being built everywhere , it seems, and a real service sector is emerging to meet heightened tourism demand. Wireless broadband is being built out across the country with infrastructure from KT ( formerly Korean Telecom). More restaurants are opening, as are universities, technical schools and preschools. The second national language has shifted from the French to English, and the country has joined the British Commonwealth.

Lastly, against this impressive backdrop crushing poverty still affects about 40% of the population. Millions live on tiny plots of land scarcely capable of producing adequate food for families in which the average woman gives birth to six children. It's this latter issue - raging population growth - that continues to perplex the policy and development works in Rwanda. Perhaps Rwanda can create opportunity for the 11 million who live there today. In response the government has embarked on an ambitious program to promote family planning, but population momentum takes years.



SECTION 6 : PERSONALITY TEST

My Inspiration story 


Imagination is everything, it is the preview to life's coming attractions. Santana Manuel once said, "If you can imagine it you can have it." There are different aspects of life that can help people.


We were given the ability to change the world through imagining things that are not seen to process them into a physical manifestation. One created a cellphone through imagination so that it can be easier and accessible to talk with anyone without being limited where to go.Another person was tired of walking and decided to design a car through imagination.


One was tired of being stuck in the traffic jam and decided to design an aeroplane to make travelling flexible. This gives me strength everyday when I wake up that if one is able to create something through imagination and have a lavish lifestyle, I can also have the same ability as well. In this digital era everyday is a challenge, there are positive people and negative people . And I try my best to involve myself around people who are positive in everything in terms of a brighter future because negative people disturb a good character and vision.


Inorder to build my future I interact with positive people who have the same agenda and share ideas norms, values and custom which sharps my destiny. We were given the power to create and destroy at the same time by nature. Which means that we have the ability to sharp shift our future everyday. 


Sometimes we lose hope as human beings when we are facing alot of obstacles, but it is up to us to lift ourselves and fight our way out. The first aspect of success is failing and we get back up because we were never born to quit but we were born for something extraordinary that is winning. Everyday is full of self discoveries of the new abilities that we did not have before like multi tasking doing everything at the same time but perfecting it all. This is done when a person admits that he or she is not complete yet but there is need to learn, observe and try again as it is the cycle of life. 

That is my inspiration story.

23/11/23, 11:50 - +263 77 277 7168: I took it on that page👆🏻
23/11/23, 11:51 - Shubham Madhwal: I believe he must have been having network issues! Hence Mr Kwadzwa must have not replied back, you can connect with again and I am sure he will respond!
23/11/23, 11:51 - +263 77 277 7168: Ok sir
23/11/23, 12:27 - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Panashe's letter?
23/11/23, 13:21 - +263 77 277 7168: For the first payment of $200 on 28 November and the other $150 on the 28 of December
23/11/23, 13:24 - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/11/23, 13:28 - +263 77 277 7168: Number 2
23/11/23, 14:17 - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
23/11/23, 14:17 - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
23/11/23, 14:17 - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

23/11/23, 15:36 - Shubham Madhwal: @263772777168 since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
23/11/23, 15:36 - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
23/11/23, 15:37 - +263 77 277 7168: Ok sir let me try to pay on Monday
