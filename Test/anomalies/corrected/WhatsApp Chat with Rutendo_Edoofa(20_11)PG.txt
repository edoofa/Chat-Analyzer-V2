Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 15:56 - Pallika Edoofa: Since Rutendo do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

22/11/23, 16:39 - Pallika Edoofa: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*

24/11/23, 15:46 - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me 

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?

2)How do you aim to make sure that your child achieves his career aspirations from studying in India? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 16:24 - +263 77 390 0076: india is te third largest education system ,affordability and scholarship,cultural diversity,global recognition, etc
24/11/23, 16:28 - Pallika Edoofa: Rutendo, 
I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
24/11/23, 16:38 - +263 77 390 0076: no im not aware
24/11/23, 16:39 - Pallika Edoofa: That's not a problem, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/11/23, 16:40 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 16:40 - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
