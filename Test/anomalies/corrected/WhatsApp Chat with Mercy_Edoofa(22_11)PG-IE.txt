23/11/23, 13:07 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
23/11/23, 13:25 - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 13:26 - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we are
23/11/23, 13:33 - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this!!
23/11/23, 13:33 - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
23/11/23, 13:33 - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 13:38 - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l get it
23/11/23, 13:39 - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l do foreign research but l have not applied to any
23/11/23, 13:49 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 14:28 - +263 78 006 5624: Ok  l get it
23/11/23, 14:38 - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
23/11/23, 14:38 - Pallika Edoofa: Please share the term results too
23/11/23, 20:08 - +263 78 006 5624: Ok
23/11/23, 20:35 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 12:41 - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
24/11/23, 13:17 - +263 78 006 5624: How are you
24/11/23, 13:18 - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am lets start but today network is being a challenge
24/11/23, 13:23 - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing great and hope the same for you.
24/11/23, 13:24 - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mercy, As you have mentioned your subjects as Biology, Chemistry, and Pure mathematics and you wanted to pursue medicine so, I would like to know why you haven't opted for Physics?
24/11/23, 13:24 - +263 78 006 5624: I'm great
24/11/23, 13:28 - +263 78 006 5624: At my school a student is allowed to choose only 1 subject between Biology and physics so when l was in form 3 l chose Biology but for form 1 and 2 l did Combined Science
24/11/23, 13:28 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mercy, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 13:28 - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
24/11/23, 13:46 - Pallika Edoofa: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.

24/11/23, 15:29 - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
