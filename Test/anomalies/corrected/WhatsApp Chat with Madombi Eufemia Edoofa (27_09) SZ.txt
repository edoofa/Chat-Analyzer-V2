06/10/23, 13:59 - +263 77 602 4340: No
06/10/23, 14:07 - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Ms. Tsitsi! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

06/10/23, 14:07 - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
06/10/23, 14:29 - +263 77 602 4340: Telling the truth l dont think my family can afford such amount as we are not that financially stable
06/10/23, 15:23 - +91 82875 72068: I can understand your concern, Ms. Tsitsi. May I know what part of the fee is not affordable, please?
06/10/23, 22:43 - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 06:41 - +263 77 141 9582: Let's chat at 10.30am

07/10/23, 12:01 - +91 82875 72068: Kindly excuse me for the delay. I was in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application. Thank you for your patience.
07/10/23, 12:02 - +263 77 141 9582: You are most welcome
07/10/23, 12:05 - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Albert. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country?
07/10/23, 12:07 - +263 77 141 9582: May ms Tsitsi answer this question.
07/10/23, 12:12 - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Mr. Albert. I will waiting for her response.
07/10/23, 12:15 - +263 77 141 9582: Midlands state university 650 per semester
07/10/23, 12:16 - +91 82875 72068: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 650$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
07/10/23, 12:17 - +263 77 537 4952: Unversty of Zimbabwe Mount Pleasent$650
07/10/23, 12:21 - +263 77 141 9582: You are right Mr Edoofa
07/10/23, 12:27 - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Albert. Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that whidh barely leads to employment, please?
07/10/23, 13:04 - +263 77 141 9582: No idea sir
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Albert. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
07/10/23, 13:06 - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

09/10/23, 14:57 - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Eufemia. However, I just noticed that this number is registered as Ms. Tariro in the student's file. May I know whether you are using this number, please?
09/10/23, 14:58 - +263 77 602 4340: Yes l dont  have a phone so l am using this one
09/10/23, 14:59 - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Eufemia. May I know whether you have comprehended this information, please?
09/10/23, 15:00 - +263 77 602 4340: Yes  but l have no idea how it is done
09/10/23, 15:00 - +91 82875 72068: Well, Eufemia. I would kindly request you to go through these messages, please.
09/10/23, 15:00 - +263 77 602 4340: Okay
09/10/23, 15:03 - +263 77 602 4340: I  did  go through them sir l do understand what you are saying and l  am pretty sure that this will help me a lot  and is very beneficial to my family and l
09/10/23, 15:05 - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
09/10/23, 15:05 - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
09/10/23, 15:05 - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/10/23, 15:05 - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

09/10/23, 15:06 - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
09/10/23, 15:11 - +263 77 602 4340: Thank you very  much sir l have realized how its done and l  am pretty sure that it will go smoothly with me
09/10/23, 15:12 - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/10/23, 15:12 - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/10/23, 15:12 - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/10/23, 15:19 - +263 77 602 4340: Truly speaking l have appreciated all the four points  but the one that l have appreciated the most is the earn while you learn as it prepares me to face the real world and helps me  to be more concentrated  on my work and gaining seriousness
09/10/23, 15:43 - +91 82875 72068: Now I know you focus more on employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

10/10/23, 09:59 - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/10/23, 13:18 - +263 77 141 9582: Sorry I was busy sir.
10/10/23, 14:30 - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Albert!
10/10/23, 14:30 - +91 82875 72068: That is totally fine, Mr. Albert.
10/10/23, 14:30 - +91 82875 72068: Can you please acknowledge this question?
10/10/23, 15:23 - +263 77 141 9582: Proud
10/10/23, 15:24 - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents.
10/10/23, 15:24 - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
10/10/23, 15:27 - +263 77 141 9582: No idea sir
10/10/23, 16:03 - +91 82875 72068: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
10/10/23, 16:03 - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/10/23, 16:03 - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 16:03 - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
10/10/23, 18:05 - +91 82875 72068: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
10/10/23, 18:25 - +263 77 141 9582: Any challenges I will notify you. Goodnight.
10/10/23, 18:26 - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Mr. Albert. Since there are limited seats available and the session needs to follow a specific timeline, your activeness in the group is imperative for the session to move forward! However, Eufemia can continue with the session in your absence!
10/10/23, 18:28 - +263 77 141 9582: Thank you
10/10/23, 18:29 - +91 82875 72068: @263779096160 may I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
10/10/23, 18:40 - +263 77 141 9582: Maybe she is occupied
10/10/23, 18:51 - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Mr. Albert. May I know whether you have read the information, please?
10/10/23, 18:55 - +263 77 141 9582: I read it
10/10/23, 19:08 - +91 82875 72068: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
10/10/23, 19:09 - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/10/23, 19:14 - +263 77 141 9582: Okay
10/10/23, 19:15 - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
10/10/23, 19:26 - +263 77 141 9582: Edoofa is a provider, a helper.
10/10/23, 19:29 - +263 77 141 9582: I am out of words may  you allow me to a plain tomorrow.
10/10/23, 19:30 - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Mr. Albert. However, I would request you to be active for the next 30 minutes as we are about to conclude the session. @263776024340 Ms. Tariro. I would kindly request you to continue with the session in Mr. Albert's absence, please.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

25/10/23, 15:58 - +263 77 537 4952: Morning sir
25/10/23, 16:00 - Sahil Edoofa: How are you doing today ?
25/10/23, 16:00 - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/10/23, 16:00 - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
25/10/23, 16:00 - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
