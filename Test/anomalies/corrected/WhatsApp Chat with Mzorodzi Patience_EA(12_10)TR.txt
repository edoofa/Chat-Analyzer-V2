13/10/23, 10:42 - Tushti: That is correct
13/10/23, 10:42 - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

16/10/23, 14:28 - Tushti: What are your thoughts?
16/10/23, 15:04 - +258 84 646 4269: I did not know that it's the world's leading institution. Am more impressed.
16/10/23, 15:21 - Tushti: I am glad to hear that
16/10/23, 15:21 - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
16/10/23, 15:26 - +258 84 646 4269: No
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/10/23, 15:32 - Tushti: In simple words @258846464269 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/10/23, 15:38 - +258 84 646 4269: Thank you so much the program helps a lot am  glad
16/10/23, 15:46 - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/10/23, 16:05 - +258 84 646 4269: Yes
16/10/23, 16:05 - Tushti: @258846464269 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 16:05 - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 16:06 - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 16:06 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 16:06 - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

17/10/23, 10:25 - +258 84 646 4269: Hopefully with the hunger of learning that my daughter has, we shall be helping her be one of the award winners. I like this
17/10/23, 10:43 - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/10/23, 10:54 - +258 84 646 4269: Yes I am ready
17/10/23, 11:01 - +258 84 646 4269: Is  Adoofa under a religious organization where by it will be mandatory for the students to be part of it, in terms of church
17/10/23, 11:18 - +258 84 646 4269: But we do not have problems with Indian culture it's only for her to be well prepared in all aspects
17/10/23, 11:36 - Tushti: @258846464269 There is no such condition. In fact, our Edoofian students here in India enjoy going to Church together every Sunday

17/10/23, 11:41 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 11:41 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 11:41 - Tushti: I hope you now understand?
17/10/23, 11:42 - +258 84 646 4269: Thank you so much
17/10/23, 11:44 - Tushti: @258846464269 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/10/23, 11:47 - +258 84 646 4269: They will spend a lot more money
17/10/23, 11:48 - Tushti: Exactly @258846464269 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750
17/10/23, 11:48 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 11:49 - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/10/23, 11:49 - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/10/23, 11:58 - +258 84 646 4269: The program helps a lot, hence makes fees paying very cheap and easy
17/10/23, 11:58 - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/10/23, 11:59 - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
17/10/23, 11:59 - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/10/23, 12:06 - +258 84 646 4269: Thanks to hear this, 30 days of running around look for the reminder 150 is pretty enough,
17/10/23, 12:15 - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: Alright @258846464269 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/10/23, 12:16 - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
17/10/23, 12:23 - +258 84 646 4269: It is clear we can go ahead
17/10/23, 12:25 - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/10/23, 12:25 - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*
17/10/23, 12:25 - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

19/10/23, 10:53 - +258 84 646 4269: In ADOOFA program I learnt that they are many people applying every day. It's a clear and fair program in that they are always eager to let the family of the students understand the program, NEVER  a student join secretly. We as parents should participate, encourage the child in hard working also understand and be prepared in terms of payments since the applicants are many. ADOOFA is neither sponsorship nor free education propaganda neither. Child should only apply after his/ her final exams at high school. I learnt that applying to ADOOFA program is totally different from applying to a University since ADOOFA gives chance to earn as you learn.  For all these benefits the parents only pay $350
19/10/23, 10:54 - Shubham Madhwal: Duly  Noted, Please, And why have Panashe, Completed the scholarship test?

Life in Rwanda today is very different from what it was like before and during the genocide of 1994.The county has made significant progress in rebuilding it's economy and infrastructure,and in promoting peace and reconciliation among it's people.The  government has implemented a number of initiatives to improve the lives of it's citizens , including investing in education, health care,and agriculture. While the country still faces  challenges  such as poverty and inequality,it has made great strides in the past 16 years and is considered to be one of the most improved countries. The 1994 genocide was very traumatic event for the people of Rwanda, and the effects of that trauma are still felt today. Many survivors continue to struggle with mental and physical health issues,and some have been left homeless and without any means of support. However, the progressive that has been made in rebuilding the country is truly inspiring, and gives hope for the future.

Inspirational short story about letting Go

"Do you know how hunters of old used to trap monkeys?" A man asked his child. 
"Rather than chasing them up a tree or shooting arrows from below ,they had put a heavy glass jar with a narrow neck on the floor ,which had the monkeys' favourite food  inside . 
They'd then step back and hide , waiting for the unsuspecting animal to approach . When it did, the monkey would reach inside, clench a fest around the food ,and try to pull it out .
However, the narrow neck of the jar would stop the poor monkey from getting it's hand out .
It'd pull and pull ,but to know avail . There was simply no way to get it's hand out of the jar without releasing the food. Rather than letting go , though, the monkey would persevere, refusing to drop it's dinner . The hunters would then approach and catch it to enjoy a meal of their own."Don't be like that monkey," warned the man ,"in life, to fight another day and grow as person ,you must know when to quit, when to move on , and when to let go of whatever 's holding you back ."
Moral of the story :
Sometimes you have to let go and give up what you have know inorder to receive something better in the future . Don't let stubbornness be your downfall!

24/10/23, 12:40 - Shubham Madhwal: Please here is his contact!
24/10/23, 12:45 - +258 84 646 4269: Thank you
24/10/23, 12:46 - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Patience's letter?
24/10/23, 12:47 - +258 84 646 4269: 29 of October 2023
24/10/23, 12:48 - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
24/10/23, 12:53 - +258 84 646 4269: We are only able to pay through Mr Shorwi account FBC
24/10/23, 12:59 - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
24/10/23, 12:59 - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.
