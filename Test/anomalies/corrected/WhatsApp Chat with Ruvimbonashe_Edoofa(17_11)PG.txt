17/11/23, 18:20 - +263 78 246 2832: What do u mean by tuition fees
17/11/23, 18:21 - Pallika Edoofa: Ruvimbonashe, "Tuition fees" refer to the amount of money that educational institutions charge for instruction and other services.

17/11/23, 18:36 - +263 78 246 2832: Last term I had 12 points that is my end of term exam
17/11/23, 18:37 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rumbonashe, Please do remember to share the results
17/11/23, 18:38 - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
17/11/23, 18:40 - +263 78 246 2832: Yaaa I can
17/11/23, 18:40 - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!

17/11/23, 18:44 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 20:06 - +263 77 127 4834: Sorry guys was busy .I am a mother of two ,I am an interprenuire , I just want my little sister to be someone in life
17/11/23, 20:08 - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Lisa
