07/11/23, 20:20 - +263 77 512 7057: Good evening Ms Pallika. 
I am glad that you allowed us to partake in your discussion regarding Joel's application to be considered for the Efoofa Scholarship Program. 
I would want to clarify certain issues as his biological father. 
Firstly, l am a retired policeman like he indicated. I retired way back in 2012
He is the last born out of my four children(three boys and one girl) 
He did his primary education here in Gweru(Zimbabwe) and at Matongo Primary School.
He then proceeded to do his secondary education at Nashville High where he obtained eleven ordinary level passes. 
He chose to do MPC(maths, physics and chemistry) and in addition, he is also doing Geography. 
When l inquired why this combination, he stated that he has always wanted to be a pilot. 
Personally, l know this is a challenging profession but, the young man is always after that which is more challenging. 
Now having said that, it is my pleasure if he could get the opportunity to study abroad and fulfill his ambitions. 
As a pensioner, l will try my best to finance his studies and with your assistance, l believe he will pull through. 
Thank you so much and., 
God bless❤

08/11/23, 14:23 - Pallika Edoofa: So, Joel, as your father has shared thoroughly about yourself, I would like to know may I know what fascinated you about pursuing this course and career as a Pilot?
08/11/23, 14:23 - +263 77 706 6703: iam doing great and you
08/11/23, 14:31 - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great, Thank you for asking

08/11/23, 15:10 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, so, Please let me know what fascinated you about pursuing this course and career as a Pilot?
08/11/23, 16:32 - +263 71 445 9621: Good afternoon Ms Pallika,
Financially, l am that stable since my only income is pension benefits.
However, l am sacrificing  and struggling to make ends meet for my beloved son.
This is all because he is so determined to achieve his vision and God willing, this will come to pass
08/11/23, 16:32 - +263 71 445 9621: I am not that stable financially......
08/11/23, 16:38 - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Dzingirai, that you are ready to do anything for your child, However, I am looking forward to having a conversation with Joel and I hope that he is not available at present.
08/11/23, 16:39 - Pallika Edoofa: @263714459621 I would like you to answer this on Joel's behalf.
08/11/23, 17:48 - +263 71 445 9621: In Gweru(Zimbabwe) where we reside, there is an Airforce of Zimbabwe base from where military aircrafts often carry out their military exercises.
I believe it is from these exercises that Joel developed an interest in one day flying a plan.
08/11/23, 17:48 - +263 71 445 9621: The Airforce base is a few meters from where we stay. My opinion is, he mighty have been inspired by these.
08/11/23, 18:39 - Pallika Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Dzingirai, I appreciate your understanding. It's essential to recognize that aspiring to become a pilot usually involves enrolling in an aviation school equipped with the required infrastructure. Currently, we do not have any partnerships with aviation schools, which is why we do not offer pilot training programs. However, for those interested in aviation-related career paths, we do offer alternatives, such as aerospace engineering courses and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Aviation Management.
08/11/23, 18:52 - +263 77 706 6703: if you do not have the pilot enrollment i can take aerospace engineering course

16/11/23, 13:43 - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
16/11/23, 13:45 - +263 77 706 6703: its one of tge developed countries while my country is not . I will be able to access many resources
16/11/23, 13:46 - Pallika Edoofa: Joel, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/11/23, 13:47 - +263 77 706 6703: noo we are not , enlighten us
16/11/23, 13:50 - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Joel, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 13:50 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 13:55 - +263 77 706 6703: yes so after thr scholarship is it  100 percent scholarship or a 50 percent
16/11/23, 13:57 - Pallika Edoofa: Joel, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
16/11/23, 13:57 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
16/11/23, 14:47 - +263 77 706 6703: okay thank you for that
16/11/23, 14:47 - +263 77 706 6703: no i do not
16/11/23, 14:52 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, PleaseLet me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 14:52 - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/11/23, 14:52 - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/11/23, 14:52 - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/11/23, 14:52 - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
16/11/23, 14:53 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 14:53 - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
16/11/23, 14:53 - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
16/11/23, 14:54 - +263 77 706 6703: yes sir it will be a life time experince
16/11/23, 14:55 - +263 77 706 6703: soo did i get it ,the scholarship by now
16/11/23, 14:58 - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Joel, You will be getting the scholarship once you found eligible in the eligibility test that will take place after today's session.
16/11/23, 14:58 - Pallika Edoofa: Also,


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
16/11/23, 15:00 - +263 77 706 6703: i get it
16/11/23, 15:00 - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know that!!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
16/11/23, 15:05 - +263 77 512 7057: I am following the deliberations as a parent with keen interest and, please go ahead and tell us how that is done. 👏👏👏
16/11/23, 15:06 - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Mr. Dzingirai, I have shared the detailed information it, also I tagged it for you, Please go through that.
16/11/23, 15:16 - +263 77 512 7057: I appreciate the Earn While You Learn program.

So now I know you focus more on *Earn While You Learn*

16/11/23, 15:34 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Dzingirai, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about Joel studying abroad? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 15:38 - +263 77 512 7057: We really are in support of Joel studying abroad, in particular India. 
It will be a dream come true for him and the entire family.
16/11/23, 15:44 - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Dzingirai, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Joel's career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting your family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
16/11/23, 15:44 - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
16/11/23, 15:51 - +263 77 512 7057: Where does he get the application form from? 
Which senior authorities write a letter of recommendation?
16/11/23, 16:15 - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Dzingirai, These are the procedures that you follow when you apply directly to an institution. The Application form would be available from the University. It can be accessed online as well and The senior authorities can be the School head or any reputed person who knows the applicant
16/11/23, 18:07 - +263 77 512 7057: Understood and, thank you so much for clarity.
16/11/23, 18:08 - Pallika Edoofa: You're Welcome, Mr. Dzingirai.
16/11/23, 18:08 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Dzingirai, Please note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
16/11/23, 18:08 - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
16/11/23, 18:09 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 18:09 - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
16/11/23, 18:12 - +263 77 512 7057: Yes, you can go ahead.
16/11/23, 18:14 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Dzingirai.
16/11/23, 18:14 - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
16/11/23, 18:14 - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 18:14 - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

17/11/23, 13:00 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin?
17/11/23, 13:00 - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 20:58 - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Joel, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
17/11/23, 21:08 - +263 77 512 7057: Go ahead
18/11/23, 07:51 - +263 71 445 9621: It seems your sessions are far too many and remember, Joel is writing his final year exams.
You end up disturbing him and end up unable to achieve the intended goal.
There is also a lot of repetition in your so called evaluation.

I am here to begin the session,

18/11/23, 22:43 - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Dzingirai, I completely understand your concerns regarding the ongoing exams for many applicants and the strong support families are providing for their children. In your specific case, the application process began on November 7th, and now, on the 18th, I share your concern, especially considering the number of applicants waiting for their turn. Joel's application, in particular, has been in the process for an extended period. Typically, counseling sessions are conducted within one or two days, but due to a lack of activity, and recognizing your potential time constraints, the process has been prolonged. Also, Can you point out which has been repeated so that I can help you understand why it is necessary in the session?

However, as we have a limited number of available seats, it is crucial for you to actively engage in the session and follow through with the necessary steps to secure your spot.
23/11/23, 14:09 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 14:17 - +263 77 512 7057: I think we are still stuck in the personalised councilling session which l believe is becoming monotonous
23/11/23, 14:18 - Pallika Edoofa: That is correct!!
23/11/23, 14:18 - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

23/11/23, 14:28 - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

23/11/23, 14:28 - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
