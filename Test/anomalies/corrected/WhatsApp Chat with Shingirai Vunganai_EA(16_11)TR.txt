17/11/23, 10:41 - +263 77 864 0240: It is a scholarship for lower six and upper six students..It helps students with their tertiary education in India . Edoofian counsellors also play a crucial role in helping students to choose courses which best suit the combination.... Edoofian program is unique as it offers 50-100% scholarship  but can further subsidize the tuition fee with ( EWYL) Earn while you learn program ... Moreso they assign projects which one can earn a fee in United States Dollars ..The fee won't be tangible as it would be transferred straight to the tuition fee
17/11/23, 10:49 - +263 77 864 0240: It was founded by Anhad Edutrain Pvt LTD
17/11/23, 11:01 - Tushti: Wonderful!

17/11/23, 13:03 - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?

17/11/23, 13:16 - +263 77 864 0240: Yes financial crisis....The salary she is being paid does not cover all the needs.
17/11/23, 14:08 - Tushti: In that case, may I know how the family would manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
17/11/23, 14:11 - +263 77 864 0240: They will save up in advance and create a budget for expenses such as tuition and other supplies .

Studying abroad would provide me with exposure to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking, which can help me develop a more global outlook. It would also give me the opportunity to improve my language skills and develop cross-cultural communication skills. Additionally, I would gain valuable experience living and studying in a foreign country, which can be a valuable asset in today's globalized world.
17/11/23, 15:55 - Tushti: I completely understand
17/11/23, 15:55 - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination
You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

17/11/23, 17:04 - +263 77 864 0240: Thank you for sending me pictures pictures and the video! It is clear that India has some excellent educational institutions and opportunities for learning and growth. However, as I mentioned before, I believe that studying abroad can provide unique experiences and perspectives that would be beneficial for my future career and personal growth. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about India's education system, but I am still interested in pursuing an international education.
18/11/23, 09:30 - Tushti: Hello , Good afternoon, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/11/23, 09:30 - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
18/11/23, 09:30 - +263 77 864 0240: Good morning
18/11/23, 09:40 - Tushti: Amazing, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
18/11/23, 09:41 - +263 77 864 0240: No ma'am.
18/11/23, 09:41 - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/11/23, 09:41 - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/11/23, 09:41 - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/11/23, 09:42 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 09:42 - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/11/23, 09:42 - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/11/23, 09:44 - +263 77 864 0240: I see, so your company helps students to reduce the cost of their education and gives them the opportunity to work to offset the remaining cost of their education. That's a great service! In response, I would say something like, "Our Earn While You Learn Program is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain valuable work experience while reducing the cost of their education. It's a win-win for students and a great way to make their education more accessible and affordable. Thank you for the opportunity to learn more about your company and the services you offer."
18/11/23, 09:45 - Tushti: I am glad to see you understand how we help our students
18/11/23, 09:45 - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
18/11/23, 09:45 - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/11/23, 09:46 - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/11/23, 09:46 - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/11/23, 09:46 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 09:46 - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
18/11/23, 09:53 - +263 77 864 0240: Indeed it is quite spectacular and brain widening.Getting such an opportunity to earn while you learn is an amazing experience
18/11/23, 09:56 - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
18/11/23, 09:56 - Tushti: Nisha, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/11/23, 10:00 - +263 77 864 0240: What is the guarantee of applying?
18/11/23, 10:05 - Tushti: Dear, you would recieve an acceptance letter from the University we apply to
18/11/23, 10:06 - Tushti: Kindly calculate the answer, and I shall explain further
18/11/23, 10:07 - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
18/11/23, 10:08 - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.
18/11/23, 10:10 - Tushti: Can you tell me the answer now?
18/11/23, 10:13 - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am due to financial constraints I guess I will afford to pay 1
18/11/23, 10:14 - Tushti: Dear, I asked you to calculate the answer here
18/11/23, 10:14 - +263 77 864 0240: Ok
18/11/23, 10:14 - +263 77 864 0240: $1500 _ $2 500
18/11/23, 10:14 - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/11/23, 10:15 - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/11/23, 10:15 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 10:15 - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/11/23, 10:18 - +263 77 864 0240: I see ma'am.
18/11/23, 10:19 - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/11/23, 10:19 - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/11/23, 10:19 - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/11/23, 10:19 - Tushti: Do you have any questions so far?
18/11/23, 10:20 - +263 77 864 0240: This is a really interesting and innovative solution to the problem of high application costs. It's great that your program is helping to alleviate some of the financial burden for students during these challenging times. In response, I would emphasize the value of the Edoofa Program and the benefits that students can gain from joining.moreso
"The Edoofa Program is a unique opportunity for students to gain the support and guidance they need to successfully apply to universities and scholarships. With our program, students can save money on application fees and gain access to valuable resources and support. We are excited to offer this program to students at such
18/11/23, 10:20 - +263 77 864 0240: I'm still following ma'am.
18/11/23, 10:21 - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
18/11/23, 10:21 - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.
18/11/23, 10:21 - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
18/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/11/23, 10:22 - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
18/11/23, 10:25 - +263 77 864 0240: Absolutely! Edoofa is truly revolutionizing the way students apply to universities and scholarships. By bundling all of these services together, you're providing students with a one-stop-shop for all of their application needs. Not only does this save students money, but it also makes the process less stressful and more streamlined. I think this is a really great solution for international students who are looking to study abroad. I'm curious, what kind of training is offered through the Earn While You learn program?
18/11/23, 10:28 - Tushti: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

18/11/23, 10:29 - Tushti: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/11/23, 10:31 - +263 77 864 0240: It's clear that the Edoofa Program is not only about getting students into universities, but also about preparing them for life after graduation. The webinars you described are a great way to help students gain a deeper understanding of the job market and what it takes to be successful in their chosen field. I think this type of training is invaluable, and can give students a real advantage when it comes to finding a job and building a career. This program really seems to go above and beyond the traditional university experience, and I think it would be beneficial for any student who wants to make the most of their education.
18/11/23, 10:33 - +263 77 864 0240: Thank you for deeper elaboration ma'am..It's becoming more clear.

18/11/23, 10:36 - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

18/11/23, 10:36 - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

20/11/23, 21:25 - +263 77 864 0240: SECTION 5 : What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there ?.                                      Life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, has seen significant progress in terms of recovery and reconciliation. The country has made remarkable strides in rebuilding infrastructure, fostering economic development, and promoting social cohesion. Efforts toward justice and reconciliation have played a crucial role in healing the wounds of the past.

Rwanda has experienced economic growth, with a focus on sectors such as agriculture, technology, and tourism. Government initiatives have aimed at improving education, healthcare, and overall living standards for the population. The resilience and unity of the Rwandan people have contributed to the positive transformation of the nation.

However, challenges remain, including the ongoing process of dealing with the psychological and emotional impact of the genocide. Efforts to promote national healing, unity, and sustainable development continue to be essential components of Rwanda's post-genocide journey. To add on Sixteen years after the devastating genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994, the country has undergone a remarkable transformation, characterized by resilience, reconciliation, and significant progress on various fronts. The aftermath of the genocide left deep scars, both physical and emotional, but the people of Rwanda, under strong leadership, have worked tirelessly to rebuild their nation.

One of the most notable aspects of post-genocide Rwanda is the impressive economic growth and development. The government has implemented policies focused on rebuilding infrastructure, promoting economic diversification, and attracting foreign investment. Agriculture, technology, and tourism have emerged as key sectors contributing to the nation's economic resurgence. The construction of roads, schools, and healthcare facilities has not only improved the overall quality of life but has also facilitated better connectivity within the country.

Educational reforms have played a crucial role in shaping Rwanda's future. The government has prioritized education, aiming to create a well-educated and skilled workforce. Access to education has expanded, and there is a concerted effort to address historical disparities. This focus on education is seen as an investment in the nation's youth, fostering a sense of hope and ambition for the future.

Healthcare in Rwanda has also seen improvements, with initiatives to enhance medical infrastructure and accessibility to services. Efforts have been made to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, contributing to an overall improvement in public health. Additionally, the government has implemented community-based health insurance programs, ensuring that a larger segment of the population has access to healthcare services.

Reconciliation has been a central theme in Rwanda's post-genocide journey. The government has implemented policies and programs to promote unity and healing among the population. The Gacaca courts, traditional community-based justice mechanisms, were established to address the overwhelming number of cases resulting from the genocide. These courts aimed not only at dispensing justice but also at facilitating truth and reconciliation within communities.

Social cohesion initiatives have been complemented by efforts to address trauma and mental health challenges resulting from the genocide. Counseling and support services have been provided to survivors, acknowledging the long-lasting psychological impact of the events of 1994. Civil society organizations and international partners have also played a role in supporting these initiatives.

While the progress in Rwanda is commendable, challenges persist. The process of reconciliation is ongoing, and there are still instances of tension and mistrust between communities. Additionally, issues related to governance, political freedoms, and human rights have been subjects of debate and scrutiny. Striking a balance between stability and democratic principles remains a delicate challenge.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide reflects a nation that has made substantial strides in rebuilding, reconciling, and progressing towards a more prosperous future. The resilience of the Rwandan people, coupled with strategic government initiatives, has laid a foundation for sustainable development. The journey from tragedy to recovery serves as a testament to the human spirit's capacity for renewal and the possibility of rebuilding even in the face of unimaginable adversity.
20/11/23, 21:26 - +263 77 864 0240: SECTION : 6.  My Inspirational Story.                                                To commence with ,Life is a journey filled with challenges and opportunities and through overcoming these obstacles we find inspiration.l am going to share the story of Rutendo  in which her aspirations ,determination and hardwork made a transformative power of hospitality globally.                                        Once upon a time, in Matusadonha  village nestled between rolling hills and crystal-clear lakes, there lived a young courageous woman named Rutendo. Rutendo had a dream that extended beyond the boundaries of her small village — she aspired to create a haven for travelers, a place where hearts would find warmth, and memories would be etched into the very fabric of their souls.

With unyielding determination,Rutendo  set out to transform her quaint village into a destination that would beckon travelers from all corners of the globe. She believed in the magic of hospitality, understanding that a welcoming smile and genuine care could transcend language barriers and cultural differences.

Rutendo's started small, opening a charming guesthouse that reflected the rich tapestry of her village's traditions. Each room told a story, adorned with local crafts and artifacts that whispered tales of the community's history. Rutendo's  passion radiated through every detail, creating an ambiance that enveloped guests in a warm embrace.

Word spread about Rutendo's  oasis, and soon, travelers seeking authenticity and connection flocked to her village. They were welcomed not just as visitors but as cherished guests, invited to partake in the village's daily life — from cooking classes with local chefs to storytelling sessions under the starlit sky.

As Rutendo's guesthouse flourished, so did the village. The locals found new opportunities as artisans, guides, and storytellers, sharing their unique perspectives with the world. Amina's commitment to sustainable tourism ensured that the environment thrived alongside the community. Eco-friendly practices became a hallmark of her venture, setting an example for others in the hospitality industry.

Rutendo's story became an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and ignited a movement in the realm of tourism. The focus shifted from mass tourism to meaningful experiences, from generic accommodations to places that told stories. Rutendo's village became a symbol of how one person's vision and passion could spark a revolution, transforming not just a place but also the lives of those who called it home.

Through the lens of Rutendo's journey, the world witnessed the transformative power of hospitality. Travelers became ambassadors of goodwill, carrying the spirit of Rutendo's village back to their homes. A ripple effect began, with other communities adopting similar models, embracing diversity, and celebrating the beauty of human connection.

And so, Rutendo's dream, born from the humble aspirations of a young woman, became a beacon for a new era in tourism — an era where every journey was a celebration of shared humanity, and every destination a canvas painted with the colors of hospitality and hope.

23/11/23, 13:16 - +263 77 864 0240: Sir may I ask a question pertaining to the scholarship how many points are needed.
23/11/23, 13:28 - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
