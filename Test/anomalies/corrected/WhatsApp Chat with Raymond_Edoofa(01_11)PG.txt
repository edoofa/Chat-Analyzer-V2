Yah it is really helpful to know for knowing a lot about India and it's background
14/11/23, 08:45 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
14/11/23, 08:45 - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Raymond!
14/11/23, 08:45 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
14/11/23, 09:15 - +263 71 767 5445: Greetings to you too
14/11/23, 09:16 - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
14/11/23, 09:34 - +263 71 767 5445: I am doing great and you
14/11/23, 09:37 - +263 71 767 5445: My family is not aware yet because I haven't calculated the expense yet. 
We are on it
14/11/23, 09:42 - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Raymond, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/11/23, 09:42 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 09:48 - +263 71 767 5445: I will update them on the costs of the higher education per year
14/11/23, 09:49 - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Raymond, you ca have the discussion with them by the end of today's session, Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
14/11/23, 10:48 - +263 71 767 5445: Hook hook so it is really helpful in reducing  expensives. 
I will talk to them tonight because  they aren't close right now
14/11/23, 10:51 - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Raymond, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/11/23, 10:51 - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/11/23, 10:51 - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/11/23, 10:51 - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

14/11/23, 10:51 - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
14/11/23, 10:52 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:52 - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
14/11/23, 10:52 - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
14/11/23, 21:06 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 21:36 - +263 71 767 5445: I am very sorry my network is down
15/11/23, 10:41 - +263 71 767 5445: Yh I think this won't waste any time for an Edoofian to experience social activities
15/11/23, 12:56 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

I am here to begin the session

Shall we begin with your session?
15/11/23, 12:56 - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/11/23, 21:16 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 21:36 - +263 71 767 5445: Understood

I'm sorry about that
16/11/23, 19:10 - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Raymond, I hope that you have gone through the previous conversation, so, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
16/11/23, 21:35 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 21:51 - +263 71 767 5445: I like the third point of earn while you learn because it really shows that Edoofians come pay fees for themselves
16/11/23, 21:52 - +263 71 767 5445: I am not really sure on which time I will be available because faults here are too random but I will try

17/11/23, 13:02 - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/11/23, 13:32 - +263 71 767 5445: So far no one is yet to help me pay the remaining
17/11/23, 13:34 - +263 71 767 5445: My parents told me that they could have put 100% effort but due to the experience they are doing on my young ones they aren't ready to support for the mean time
17/11/23, 13:40 - Pallika Edoofa: But Raymond You have told me here that your parents will support.
17/11/23, 19:54 - +263 71 767 5445: Yeah they said so but they are saying  it might not be always

20/11/23, 12:53 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

Shall we begin?
20/11/23, 12:54 - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, They can Raymond!!
20/11/23, 21:17 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 13:00 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!
I hope that you are doing well today.

May I know if you are available for the session?
21/11/23, 22:09 - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Raymond, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
21/11/23, 22:39 - +263 71 767 5445: Greetings 
I discussed with all parents this night and they are all willing to help is fee
21/11/23, 22:41 - +263 71 767 5445: OK thank you  very much 
I am ready to complete the next steps
22/11/23, 12:46 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!

I am here to begin the session, 

Shall we begin the session?
22/11/23, 12:46 - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!!
22/11/23, 12:46 - Pallika Edoofa: So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/11/23, 17:38 - +263 71 767 5445: Greetings 
I they are proud of that as well and they are wishing the best
22/11/23, 17:38 - +263 71 767 5445: Thanks so much  I  will be glad
22/11/23, 17:40 - Pallika Edoofa: Raymond, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
22/11/23, 17:40 - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
22/11/23, 21:13 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 13:11 - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
23/11/23, 13:22 - +263 71 767 5445: Greetings to you too
23/11/23, 13:22 - +263 71 767 5445: We may begin the session
23/11/23, 13:30 - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this information!!
23/11/23, 13:32 - +263 71 767 5445: OK sir I'm on it
23/11/23, 13:38 - +263 71 767 5445: I think a student should have an ID card of his/her nationality. Also results of his end of year grade . He might also need an admission letter
23/11/23, 13:48 - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, The above listed requiremenst are the main requirements <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 13:48 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
23/11/23, 13:48 - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
23/11/23, 13:49 - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 13:49 - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
23/11/23, 13:49 - +263 71 767 5445: Noted
23/11/23, 13:50 - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this.
23/11/23, 13:52 - +263 71 767 5445: Yeah I would like to know for sure
23/11/23, 14:00 - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
23/11/23, 14:00 - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 14:02 - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Raymond, I would like to know that when are you going to share the term results of A level ?
23/11/23, 14:23 - +263 71 767 5445: OK then do I have a role to play
23/11/23, 14:24 - +263 71 767 5445: Favourable
23/11/23, 14:27 - +263 71 767 5445: I did not finish up my A level
23/11/23, 14:33 - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!!
23/11/23, 14:33 - Pallika Edoofa: So, Are you pursuing your A level or not?
23/11/23, 14:35 - +263 71 767 5445: I hope you will let me know  please
23/11/23, 14:36 - +263 71 767 5445: I am pursuing yet
23/11/23, 14:37 - Pallika Edoofa: That's what I was more concerned of
23/11/23, 14:37 - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

23/11/23, 14:42 - +263 71 767 5445: Don't you have something for O levels
23/11/23, 14:46 - Pallika Edoofa: Raymond, Let's wait!!
23/11/23, 14:47 - Pallika Edoofa: Before we proceed, could you clarify whether you intend to pursue A levels, leading to tertiary education abroad in the 2025 intake, or if you plan to stick with O levels and explore diploma courses?
23/11/23, 15:11 - +263 71 767 5445: I can explore diploma courses I got no problem with that
23/11/23, 15:19 - Pallika Edoofa: Raymond, So, I would like to know as earlier you agreed on Sociology, so now in which field you are more interested in?
23/11/23, 15:21 - +263 71 767 5445: I'm interested in Art
23/11/23, 15:25 - Pallika Edoofa: In which particular field, Raymond as it is having a wide range.
