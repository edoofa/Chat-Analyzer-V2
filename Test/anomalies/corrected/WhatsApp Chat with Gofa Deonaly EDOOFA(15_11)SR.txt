24/11/23, 14:45 - Sahil Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself. 
So, could you kindly tell me how much *Your High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
24/11/23, 22:16 - +263 77 494 2556: My pleasure. Ok concerning the issue of high school charges,, i was a donatee under Tanaka Educational Fund from form 1 to 4 because i had no one to pay my fees.I was learning at Mukomberanwa High School by then.The fees was $40 per term. My brother was jobless and my mom too,,my sister was married so the journey was tough but i really thank God for the donors. In 2022 my mother got employed as a teacher and had to go to a relative to stay with whilst doing my schooling..the fees there was $90 per term and she is the only one who paid it. My brother got a job as a machine operator at a certain mine this year and he also supported mom with my registration fee to write my A-level examinations.
