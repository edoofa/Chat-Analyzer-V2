24/11/23, 09:24 - +263 78 077 2350: Truth be told there isn't much he told me about Edoofa scholarships
24/11/23, 09:26 - +263 78 077 2350: All I know is that its a program that offers people scholarships to study abroad and enrich their studies, it calls for students who don't have a lot on their families, it's aim is to help students like us to study further
24/11/23, 09:34 - Harmehak: Well received, Nigel, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 09:34 - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

Are you where that Edoofa is proudly associated with your school as well and we have students who are in India and would be coming to India next year from your school itself?
24/11/23, 10:02 - +263 78 077 2350: You welcome
24/11/23, 10:03 - +263 78 077 2350: There are students from my school coming to India next year?
24/11/23, 10:08 - Harmehak: Yes please, Nigel 

Students are already in India too and would be coming next year as well.

Edoofa is Proudly associated with your school please.
24/11/23, 10:10 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay understood
24/11/23, 10:12 - Harmehak: Yes please,

How exciting it is to know the same, Nigel?
24/11/23, 10:13 - +263 78 077 2350: Its very exciting and am hoping to be part of the team to be selected
24/11/23, 10:14 - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same.
24/11/23, 10:14 - +263 78 077 2350: Am a lower 6 student when are the lower 6 selected. Pardon me
24/11/23, 10:14 - Harmehak: We are currently in the process for the same itself.
24/11/23, 10:14 - Harmehak: Well Nigel now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
24/11/23, 10:15 - +263 78 077 2350: High i highly believe it's going to change lives
24/11/23, 10:16 - Harmehak: Very correct,

So would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Nigel?
24/11/23, 10:16 - +263 78 077 2350: Even those who haven't written A level yet can have the chance to be selected?
24/11/23, 10:17 - +263 78 077 2350: I am mentally prepared for a life abroad
24/11/23, 10:19 - Harmehak: Yes please,

Like the students who are coming next year, were selected the previous year itself as this gives them time to prepare and focus on their current studies without being worried for their Higher education.

Along with this they start with their Earn While You Learn Program from Zimbabwe itself and they earn credits way before coming to India.

We will discuss the same in detail later as well.
24/11/23, 10:20 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 10:21 - +263 78 077 2350: Am hoping to be selected too
24/11/23, 10:21 - Harmehak: We look forward to the same
24/11/23, 10:22 - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your parents are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
24/11/23, 10:23 - +263 78 077 2350: Yes they are aware
24/11/23, 10:29 - Harmehak: That's great
24/11/23, 10:29 - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/11/23, 11:38 - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation, Nigel
24/11/23, 12:03 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay thank you
24/11/23, 12:04 - Harmehak: Did you go through the same?
24/11/23, 13:20 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah am doing so i haven't yet written am writing next year my Advanced level exams
24/11/23, 13:25 - Harmehak: Noted, Nigel.
24/11/23, 13:25 - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
24/11/23, 13:26 - +263 78 077 2350: Lemme see if i can take a screenshot
24/11/23, 13:27 - +263 78 077 2350: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 13:29 - +263 78 077 2350: Its something that interests me and i want to help other especially patients with heart problems, i want to save lives
24/11/23, 13:30 - +263 78 077 2350: It has always my dream and my mom's dream and i hope to carry it forward and live to it
24/11/23, 13:31 - +263 78 077 2350: My mom couldn't be a doctor and i want to be one for her and myself...
My mom's failure motivate me and she motivates to do the best for my dream to true
24/11/23, 13:40 - Harmehak: Duly received
24/11/23, 13:40 - Harmehak: I can see you have a kind heart that wishes to do well, Nigel!
24/11/23, 13:41 - Harmehak: So did you happen to research about the requirements of Medicine?
24/11/23, 13:41 - +263 78 077 2350: Thank you
24/11/23, 13:41 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah i trie by all means
24/11/23, 13:42 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah we once did a career guidance session
24/11/23, 14:04 - Harmehak: Oh alright please
24/11/23, 14:04 - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 14:09 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay its okay
24/11/23, 14:10 - +263 78 077 2350: Anything for medicine
24/11/23, 14:44 - Harmehak: Nigel, may I know if you would relate that Medicine is everything to do with Biology, please? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 14:47 - +263 78 077 2350: Its not actually what we learn in biology.. I think medicine is a whole lot different from from our biology although there are some but little stuff of biology
24/11/23, 14:47 - +263 78 077 2350: Not everything
24/11/23, 14:49 - Harmehak: Well Nigel, considering India is know for its Medical education, here Biology is utmost important.

I have had the privilege to communicate with many Zimbabwean students who happened to acknowledge the same too which is the reason usually they opt for combination that is Biology, Mathematics and Chemistry.
24/11/23, 14:53 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah but there isn't much difference between O level biology and A level biology.. With the combination Maths, physics and chemistry you can also do medicine cause u have O level biology.. I don't if you getting where am coming from
24/11/23, 14:53 - +263 78 077 2350: Totally true
24/11/23, 14:53 - +263 78 077 2350: What are the advantages of Advanced level biology over Advanced physics in medicine
24/11/23, 15:02 - Harmehak: I do understand please
24/11/23, 15:03 - Harmehak: Both are required please here in India, however like you must be aware in Zimbabwe too Physics is a mandatory requirement for Engineering rather than Medicine.
24/11/23, 15:04 - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
24/11/23, 15:05 - +263 78 077 2350: So whilst doing Maths Physics and Chemistry i can't do medicine
24/11/23, 15:07 - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 15:08 - Harmehak: Unfortunately all three which is Biology, Physics and Mathematics are required.
24/11/23, 15:09 - +263 78 077 2350: So there is a room to do medicine whilst doing Physics not biology
24/11/23, 15:09 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay good so i can do medicine
24/11/23, 15:13 - Harmehak: Unfortunately No, Nigel.

Did you understand the requirements?

Physics, Chemistry and Biology in A level are required.
24/11/23, 15:14 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay so will have to do engineering
24/11/23, 15:23 - Harmehak: You can pursue these courses under medical field as well, Nigel.
24/11/23, 15:46 - +263 78 077 2350: YEAH
24/11/23, 16:00 - Harmehak: So may I know what all you understood so far?
24/11/23, 16:12 - +263 78 077 2350: I did understood that with the combination am doing i cannot do medicine and can venture into engineering
24/11/23, 16:13 - +263 78 077 2350: If i have to do Medicine i have to do biology physics and chemistry
24/11/23, 16:20 - Harmehak: You can also venture into the following medical sector courses- Nigel
24/11/23, 16:20 - Harmehak: *1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
24/11/23, 16:36 - +263 78 077 2350: Am now thinking about engineering as it was the second choice
24/11/23, 16:37 - +263 78 077 2350: I will think about it
24/11/23, 16:38 - +263 78 077 2350: I want to study in India though
24/11/23, 17:35 - Harmehak: I appreciate Nigel.

Which field of Engineering are you intrigued towards, Nigel?
24/11/23, 17:40 - +263 78 077 2350: Chemical
24/11/23, 17:48 - Harmehak: If you are intrigued towards Chemical Engineering Nigel, don't you think degrees like Bachelor in Pharmacy and Bachelor of science in Medical laboratory Technology?
24/11/23, 17:53 - +263 78 077 2350: I will think about.. Its an option too
24/11/23, 18:05 - Harmehak: I am here to assist you and brief you regarding the same.
24/11/23, 18:12 - +263 78 077 2350: Thank you
24/11/23, 18:20 - Harmehak: Which course shall I brief you about currently?
24/11/23, 18:20 - +263 78 077 2350: Bachelor of pharmacy

24/11/23, 18:49 - +263 78 077 2350: How long does it take to become a postgraduate
24/11/23, 18:49 - Harmehak: Yes please
24/11/23, 18:49 - Harmehak: Depends on the degree, however usually it's of two years please.
24/11/23, 18:52 - +263 78 077 2350: Degree in pharmacy
24/11/23, 18:57 - Harmehak: Masters is of 2 years please. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 18:59 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay thank you
24/11/23, 18:59 - Harmehak: So far are there any queries, Nigel?
24/11/23, 18:59 - +263 78 077 2350: Pharmacy is the deal
24/11/23, 18:59 - +263 78 077 2350: I don't think so
24/11/23, 19:00 - Harmehak: Alright Nigel, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/11/23, 19:03 - +263 78 077 2350: I see my self as a great man and a responsible man and respected in society.
Getting into Edoofa program will help me to continue studying further and i will be able to achieve my dreams without giving my parents a lot of load and i can also reduce expenses for them
24/11/23, 19:07 - +263 78 077 2350: I will be able to do my best to achieve my dreams without any distraction relating to finance
24/11/23, 19:08 - Harmehak: That is really great Nigel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/11/23, 19:11 - +263 78 077 2350: I believe educational standard are getting low by the day in Zimbabwe and also outside there are better living conditions and quality education out there than here
24/11/23, 19:13 - +263 78 077 2350: Also heard that students are graduating through corruptive ways some students end up in relationships with teacher so that they get good results and some students are involved in drugs which is not a good environment to study I guess
24/11/23, 19:18 - Harmehak: You see, Nigel, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
24/11/23, 19:20 - +263 78 077 2350: You see that's also the problem
24/11/23, 19:20 - +263 78 077 2350: There is no employment herr
24/11/23, 19:20 - Harmehak: I can understand
24/11/23, 19:21 - Harmehak: However I am glad you are willing to make efforts for a promising future, Nigel.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
24/11/23, 19:22 - +263 78 077 2350: The place is just friendly and i had racism is not encouraged
24/11/23, 19:23 - +263 78 077 2350: It produces students that are productive and who are socially accepted
24/11/23, 19:23 - +263 78 077 2350: Most of the people i guess believe in God
24/11/23, 19:27 - Harmehak: That's correct, Nigel
24/11/23, 19:27 - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

24/11/23, 19:33 - +263 78 077 2350: Thank you for everything
24/11/23, 19:33 - +263 78 077 2350: For this opportunity
24/11/23, 19:35 - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Nigel

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/11/23, 19:42 - +263 78 077 2350: I guess Zambia
24/11/23, 19:42 - Harmehak: Alright please
24/11/23, 19:42 - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/11/23, 19:44 - +263 78 077 2350: Hmm its very expensive
24/11/23, 19:44 - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/11/23, 19:44 - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/11/23, 19:44 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 19:45 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 19:46 - Harmehak: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 19:46 - +263 78 077 2350: With a scholarship it can reduced to how much tuition
24/11/23, 19:46 - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
24/11/23, 19:47 - +263 78 077 2350: It's reasonable $2000 a year
24/11/23, 19:48 - Harmehak: The costs include tuition fee, Accomodation, Food and Basic university expenses.
24/11/23, 19:49 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 19:49 - +263 78 077 2350: Nice
24/11/23, 19:49 - Harmehak: Nigel, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/11/23, 19:49 - +263 78 077 2350: Is the $2000 paid at the beginning of the year or paid in parts
24/11/23, 19:50 - +263 78 077 2350: I do agree
24/11/23, 19:51 - Harmehak: Now you see Nigel, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
24/11/23, 19:53 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah interesting
24/11/23, 19:53 - +263 78 077 2350: The conditions are friendly
24/11/23, 20:00 - Harmehak: I am glad,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Nigel?
24/11/23, 20:04 - +263 78 077 2350: Yeah its a doing good for students like us and am grateful for the work you doing
24/11/23, 20:05 - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/11/23, 20:05 - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/11/23, 20:05 - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/11/23, 20:05 - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/11/23, 20:05 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 20:12 - +263 78 077 2350: How is this done
24/11/23, 20:12 - Harmehak: These are the projects under the Earn While You Learn Program and you participate online itself. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 20:12 - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/11/23, 20:15 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 20:17 - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/11/23, 20:26 - Harmehak: Projects related to research, Content writing, SEO, Digital marketing, Creative Content Creation, etc.
24/11/23, 20:27 - +263 78 077 2350: It is done paYoutube
24/11/23, 20:27 - +263 78 077 2350: So this is done over a period of how many days
24/11/23, 20:28 - +263 78 077 2350: On YouTube only
24/11/23, 20:28 - Harmehak: The entire duration of your degree, Nigel.
24/11/23, 20:29 - Harmehak: It would be done online on different platforms.

You would be alloted a dedicated mentor while you are still in Zimbabwe who would assist you thoroughly.

This way you would have earned credits even before coming to India and you would reduced your parent's financial burden.
24/11/23, 20:34 - Harmehak: I hope you have a better clarity? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 20:37 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay i get
24/11/23, 20:37 - Harmehak: That is great, 

Nigel, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
24/11/23, 20:37 - +263 78 077 2350: Thank you i understand
24/11/23, 20:37 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 20:39 - Harmehak: Nigel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/11/23, 20:39 - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/11/23, 20:40 - +263 78 077 2350: $1500-$2250
24/11/23, 20:43 - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/11/23, 20:43 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 20:43 - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/11/23, 20:43 - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/11/23, 20:45 - +263 78 077 2350: I do
24/11/23, 20:46 - +263 78 077 2350: I understand
24/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
24/11/23, 20:48 - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 20:51 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 20:53 - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/11/23, 20:53 - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 20:53 - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/11/23, 20:53 - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/11/23, 21:03 - +263 78 077 2350: Noo
24/11/23, 21:08 - +263 78 077 2350: When do you receive an acceptance letter
24/11/23, 21:10 - Harmehak: You would proceed for interview with the Program Director along with your parents,

If/when you qualify the program, you would receive your acceptance letter.
24/11/23, 21:11 - +263 78 077 2350: Okay
24/11/23, 21:11 - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/11/23, 21:11 - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
24/11/23, 21:11 - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

24/11/23, 21:15 - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
