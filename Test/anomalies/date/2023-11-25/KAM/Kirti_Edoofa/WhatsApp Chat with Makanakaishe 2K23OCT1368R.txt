I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?

24/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please do not worry. I appreciate you for keeping me informed. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
