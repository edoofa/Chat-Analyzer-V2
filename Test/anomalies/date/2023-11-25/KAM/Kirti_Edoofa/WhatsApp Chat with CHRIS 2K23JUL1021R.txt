18/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents Chris.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry?
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Good evening we were not given will talk to the Head tomorrow and see if he can give us one
18/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, you can share that tomorrow, in the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biochemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Chris had changed the course to BSc in Computer Science to start in 2024
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the error, allow me to correct it, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc computer science and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Correct
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes we remember
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - +258 87 213 7357: The registration process is where you apply for the course you want to study and your qualifications are reviewed to see if you qualify?
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct along with that may I know if you recall the registration fee of $500-$750 as well?
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes I recall
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - +258 87 213 7357: This is wonderful news, we are very excited. Thank you
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Noted, we are very grateful
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I have reviewed them we can go ahead and discuss them
18/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chris, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Understood
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Lovely😅
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes it does, and that's very good news
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 10:03 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes it does
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:07 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I understand, so normally how much does registration fee cost?
18/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Also are you saying the registration fee is paid before the results come out
18/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The registration fee varies from university to university, however, to be on the safer side, we inform the parents to prepare themselves according to $750, so that if the balance is extra it can be used in future for Chris's admission process.
18/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you will understand what I am trying to say as we move ahead with the discussion.
18/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Ok
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Well Noted, thank you
18/10/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @258872137357 may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
18/10/23, 10:56 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes I was
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Please provide more information on it
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 11:07 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I'm clear thank you for the clarification
18/10/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/10/23, 11:11 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes correct
18/10/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I agree
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 11:13 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Clear, that will be an awesome solution
18/10/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 11:15 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes
18/10/23, 11:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 11:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 11:21 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Yes could you make this clearer for me
18/10/23, 11:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, I just wanted to know if you have any queries now regarding the admission process and the costs regarding the admission process?
18/10/23, 11:23 pm - +258 87 213 7357: No I don't I understand perfectly
18/10/23, 11:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Chris's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Chris is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/10/23, 11:25 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I'm very excited and grateful for your efforts. I can't wait to receive our offer letter
18/10/23, 11:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, once you share the statement of Entry for A- level tomorrow, we shall share the applications with the university, I hope you understand the importance of the document and will share it tomorrow without any delay.
18/10/23, 11:27 pm - +258 87 213 7357: I understand I will do my best to share it tomorrow so as to avoid any delays
18/10/23, 11:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. Have a blessed night
18/10/23, 11:28 pm - +258 87 213 7357: Thank you too. Good night
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chris.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you were able to collect the statement of entry for A- level by now?
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - +258 84 694 1971: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 1:10 pm - +258 84 694 1971: As mentioned before Chris's school is not nearby. We are pushing the headmaster to send us the document. He is said to be out of school campus today. He promised to send as soon as he arrives.
19/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, can I expect an update from today you at the day's end like 08:00 pm?
19/10/23, 1:21 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Tomorrow 8.00pm would be best

25/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Chris,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm if you were able to collect the document by now?

25/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 290 0604: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Good afternoon   thank you
15/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Chris,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *PDM University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/11/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

15/11/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 5:44 am - +263 77 290 0604: Good morning, thank you ,we are indeed excited for receiving the offer letter. The time slot is OK with us in the meantime we will go over the offer letter. Thank you once again for everything you are doing to assist us
16/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chris.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to hear that you are happy and have acknowledged the message I am looking forward to connecting with you at 05:30 pm today.
16/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Good evening Sir,Chris is coming back from school tomorrow I don't know if we can wait for him
16/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright please, we can have a discussion today and once he is back tomorrow he can go through the conversation and share his thoughts with us.
16/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 290 0604: That is fine
16/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 290 0604: From previous discussions I understood that Chris application would be forwarded to a number of universities so that we have a chance to compare and make the best choice.I however have not had the chance to research on PDM yet as we are having  electricity  challenges
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 290 0604: That's fine
16/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please what you have understood is absolutely correct and for now, Chris's application has been accepted by PDM university and we are still awaiting responses from the other universities. May I know if you are clear now?
16/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes ,it's clear
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 290 0604: 1  $1315  tuition after scholarship              2   3years duration            3  $750 registration fee to be paid as soon as possible
16/11/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
16/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes it does thank you very much
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
16/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
16/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes it does, thank you for clarifying
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 290 0604: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Chris's total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes ,it is
16/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Chris with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes, it does,
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
16/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
16/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes it clarifies everything
16/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Thank you
16/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 29, 2023.
16/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of November 29, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of December 29, 2023 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 29, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes we are clear
16/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 290 0604: No I live in Norton
16/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 8:34 pm - +258 84 694 1971: This will suit us most as we are a few kms away.
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Can we have the  chance to at least see 2 other offers before we decide especially since Chris is not yet there to choose
16/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall get back to your concern here.
16/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 8:45 pm - +258 84 694 1971: When I google PDM University it gives me this ranking. 768th in India and 11536th in the World as of 2022. Is this correct
16/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I can see you are someone who really likes to have a deep understanding of what they have been offered, however, Chris this is not true, in India, there are more than 1000 universities and not every university is a right fit, if I would have been at your place I would also have googled randomly however this is not the case here, please. 

Being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for you.
16/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And rest assured I shall be sharing university insights with you for your better understanding also. Now coming back to your concern above. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
16/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
16/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
16/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the PDM university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
16/11/23, 8:58 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Understood. Thanks
16/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
16/11/23, 9:02 pm - +258 84 694 1971: No
16/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 290 0604: Yes we are ,thank you for  the information we would really like to be sure of our choice since its going to  determine Chris' future in a big way
16/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM without risking losing out on the scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:07 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Ok. Understood. Since Chris is coming tomorrow we will consult him and move forward
16/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please now may I know if you want me to share Mr. Charles details as well?
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Yes you can please
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/11/23, 9:13 pm - +258 84 694 1971: Thanks. Noted
16/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 9:14 pm - +258 84 694 1971: No questions
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDM University's credentials and official recognition by the government of India, you can visit their website by following this link: [PDM University - Recognition & Approval] (https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/).

16/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents
16/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
16/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chris!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by PDM University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
