30/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/08/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Well noted
30/08/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/08/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes I'm following
30/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes clear
30/08/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

30/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
30/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
30/08/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes you can
30/08/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Angeline.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes well noted

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
12/09/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

27/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 970 7761: EXPLAIN ABOUT BPM LIFE CYCLE 

BPM refers to the different stages of managing a business process ,from it's design and development to it's implementation and monitoring. It involves five stages which are design,modeling,execution,monitoring and optimization.

Design , this is where you identify and analyze the current process and identify any inefficiencies or areas for improvement. Once you've identified ghose areas you can develop a new process design that addresses the issues you've identified. 

That leads to stage two which is modeling, in this stage you use a tool like a flowchart or process map to create a visual representation of the new process. It's kind of like a blueprint for the process.

Execution is the third stage which is where you implement the new process design and begin testing it out in the real world. You might encounter some unexpected challenges or need to make some adjustments during this stage but it's an important part of the process.  

Once the process is in place we enter to stage four which is Monitoring, in this stage you collect data and analyze how well the new process is working. Is it achieving the desired results?Are there any bottlenecks or other issues? This data helps you make adjustments and optimize the process. 

Optimization  is where you take all the data you've collected and use it to improve the process even further. You might find ways to make it more efficient,faster or cheaper. You might also identify opportunities for automation or other technological advancement. The goal is to create a process that's as close to perfect as possible. 

In conclusion,the stages continues .
27/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 970 7761: 3.HOW DOES BUSINESS CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?

They are all important because they help to ensure that the laboratory is free from contamination which could affect the results of the experiments. 

Steam sterilization which is also known as autoclaving is a common method of sterilization that is used to kill microorganisms such as bacteria , viruses and spores.lt works by exposing the items to high temperature and pressure inside an autoclave , a special machine designed for this purpose. The high temperature which can reach up to 270 degrees Fahrenheit, destroys the microorganisms while the pressure ensures that the steam penetrates all surfaces of the items being sterilized. 

It has 3 main parts which are the chamber , the steam generator and the controls.The chamber is where the items to be sterilized are placed .The steam generator produces the steam that is used to sterilize the items .The controls regulate the temperature, pressure and cycle time of the sterilization, the chamber is vented to release the steam and the items can be removed

10/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 970 7761: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
10/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
10/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of science in Medical Lab technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes l want to persue taht
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
10/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
10/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
10/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes l know
10/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 970 7761: But what if l do not receive the offer letter from the university which l like
10/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779707761 Please understand that after we share your application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. However, If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 970 7761: What will happen if all of the universities do not accept my application
10/10/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779707761 No such cases have taken place so please I would suggest you be positive and no start with your journey with a Negative thoughts please?
10/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay
10/10/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes we are
10/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
10/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes l have
10/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 970 7761: So do l have a chance to tell you the university which l prefer or not
10/10/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please as I mentioned above If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
10/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 970 7761: I would prefer Lovely Professional University
10/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay noted
10/10/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We are happy to inform you that LPU is one of our partnered Universities and leading university as well and we have taken note of your inclination as well.
10/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
10/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay thank you
10/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 970 7761: So the remaining fee related to the university is $750 and the rest l will pay when l am there right
10/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 970 7761: What will be the cost for the visa and flight
10/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you are correct. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself and the Visa fee will be $83.
10/10/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Will the visa expire or not
10/10/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779707761 I would encourage you to be patient please, as we move ahead all your queries will be covered step by step please.
10/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay
10/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 970 7761: I have no queries
10/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

10/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes I'm following
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
10/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes I'm following u
10/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Provide more information
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes l can
10/10/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Angeline,

I trust you're in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you but haven't received one yet. Is there something that's been hindering you from replying, considering that you've had the chance to read my message?
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are available to connect with us @263779707761?
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes l am
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
11/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Angeline,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:04 am - +263 77 970 7761: Good morning
17/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Angeline I hope you are doing well. 

I am looking forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm today.
17/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Greetings
I will be free at 07:00pm
17/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I will wait for your response at 07:00 pm.
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Thank you
17/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Well noted
17/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 970 7761: We can start the discussion
17/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 970 7761: 1..975
2...3 years
3...200
4...700
17/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes clear
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 970 7761: So will l continue to have a scholarship till the end of 6 semesters or not
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Is 1125 the maximum or minimum price for the hostels
17/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Will it be near the campus
17/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes clear
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Will the examination fee change or the price will remain constant
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Clear about the health insurance fee
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The price will remain constant.
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Ok
17/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes we are
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
17/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Will it be 600 or 550
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error, I have updated it
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay okay
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Masvingo
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay thank you
17/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Okay
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes you can
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Thank you
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 970 7761: No l don't
17/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779707761 may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
17/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 970 7761: I don't have an questions
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
17/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
17/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 970 7761: I will surely discuss with them
17/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Yes very good
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night ahead.
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 970 7761: Same to you
