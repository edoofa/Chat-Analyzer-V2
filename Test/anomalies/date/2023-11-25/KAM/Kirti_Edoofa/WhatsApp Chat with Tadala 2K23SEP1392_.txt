26/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/09/23, 1:44 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Yes we can start
28/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 1:49 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: I'm done
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
28/09/23, 1:52 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Yes well understood
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Yes I'm following
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/09/23, 1:57 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Yes very clear
28/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
28/09/23, 2:00 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Is it possible for a student not to receive an acceptance letter from any University?
28/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, it is certainly possible @265997847599 if a student applies to the university on its own, however, when a student opts for the Edoofa application process, our Admissions team meticulously verifies and organizes all the essential documents needed for university admission. These documents are then promptly shared with the university, thereby completely eliminating any concerns you may have regarding this matter.
28/09/23, 2:09 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: Okay I understand
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
28/09/23, 2:33 pm - +265 997 84 75 99: For now I have no questions
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

28/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

03/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadala.

I hope you are in good health. I apologize for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday, which made it impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available to connect?

As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/10/23, 9:33 pm - +265 995 73 92 90: Yes I understood everything
03/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/10/23, 9:37 pm - +265 995 73 92 90: Yes we are on the same page
03/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
03/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

03/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, Can I anticipate that Tadala will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 pm?

13/10/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadala.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP and complete the tasks by now?
14/10/23, 8:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tadala.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you yesterday, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
17/10/23, 11:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tadala

I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa.* In the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.

We acknowledge that you gave us a day when you will be able to complete the task for Step 2 of the admission cycle however, we did not hear back from you, and the first time your phone was broken and hence we were unable to move ahead however, I think there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing your absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
17/10/23, 11:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
17/10/23, 11:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @265997847599 @265995739290 @265997390017 @23276398822 @265887101804.

18/10/23, 1:25 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: 1. Business process lifecycle are clear stages that all businesses have to follow inorder for the organization to go through it's operations. There 5 phases of the BPM  which are process design, modeling, exécution , monitoring and optimization, each phase depends on the other inorder to have efficient BPM required for the business. There three main types of BPM which are Human-centric, Document-centric and Integration-centric, these need to be understood to help guide the organization through it's operations. 
2. Lack of Businesses means less jobs created for the unemployed meaning the costumers will have less money to spend on products made by other businesses which means Businesses won't be able to expand  to bring in new improved products and services that contribute to economic growth and development.
3. These are important principles needed to be followed and sometimes referred as doing the right thing. In terms of Business Ethics is important because it's like the guideline for the business when making quick decisions for the business to increase the business growth and profits without deliberately breaking any Law.
4. HR is important in an organization because because they're the ones who organize the recruitment process for the organization, they use effective methods for recruiting applicants to hire suitable applicants according to the organizations workforce needed.
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A- level or the letter of recommendation for that?
19/10/23, 8:37 am - +265 997 39 00 17: The school didn't respond to my request for the recommendation
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadala.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that in that case, may I know by when will you be able to share your statement of entry for A- level?
19/10/23, 6:59 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: I didn't do A Level's
19/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you sharing that with me. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
19/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
19/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma in Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
19/10/23, 7:58 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes that's true
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I'm ready
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 9:19 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: It's impossible indeed
19/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 9:58 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes we discussed everything about the registration fee
19/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes i understand
19/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 10:13 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes now I understand the fee breakup clearly
19/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 10:18 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: What if the student fails to pay the tuition fee after arriving
19/10/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why do you think like that?
19/10/23, 10:30 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Because some students may be sponsored by an organization or guardian, so what if they decide to stop paying for them while they're in India can the student pay for themselves through the EWYE program?
19/10/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have love to continue our discussion and answer your query. However, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
19/10/23, 10:34 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Thanks you too
20/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Tadala,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 4:55 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I'm available
20/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/10/23, 8:05 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I'm clear
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/10/23, 8:19 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Okay I'm following
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 8:28 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: I have no question to ask for now
20/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 9:15 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: They all seemed to be excited
20/10/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I hope you are excited to be in the picture for next year as well?
20/10/23, 9:25 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I'm very excited
20/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: I really appreciate being part of the program it's really exciting
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/10/23, 9:38 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: We can proceed to our discussions
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tadala, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 11:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tadala,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
23/10/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tadala,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tadala,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Sounds interesting and yes I understand
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 7:39 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: No I understand everything clearly
25/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 7:44 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: I don't have any queries
25/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 8:30 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I'm very excited
25/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/10/23, 8:36 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Alright thanks for today's session
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Hello
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tadala.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
26/10/23, 3:05 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: We have no session today?
26/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please I would have scheduled our discussions yesterday if we had any, now we are waiting for the university's response. Once we get an update we shall notify you.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tadala,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 10:00 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Thank you so much
16/11/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
16/11/23, 10:29 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Alright i will be available
17/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening  Parents and Tadala,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasi
17/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 7:14 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I went through it thoroughly
17/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 7:38 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: 1. 975USD dollars
2. 3 years
3. 200 USD dollars
4. 500 USD dollars
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes I understand
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 7:43 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Okay I'm following
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes very clear
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/11/23, 8:09 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Okay I understand
17/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 8:23 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes please do explain
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before november 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 8:31 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes we are very clear about everything
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: I put Malawi not Zimbabwe
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes we do have a foreign currency exchange Bank
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know once you make the payment you can inform us a day prior. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/11/23, 8:57 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes very clear
17/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
17/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
17/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

18/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tadala,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 12:33 pm - +265 997 39 00 17: Yes we're still connected
