07/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Takunda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Takunda's  higher education?

17/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 980 3770: yes sure we may connect
17/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Agriculture) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024.

17/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 980 3770: year 2024 August

17/10/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, however, may I know if you even recall the registration process and the registration fee of $500-$750?
17/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 980 3770: yes sure
17/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 980 3770: l can recall the registration process and the registration fees
17/10/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 980 3770: no l dont
17/10/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 980 3770: sure thank you
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 980 3770: sure
17/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 980 3770: am through
17/10/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Takunda, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 980 3770: yes ok
17/10/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 980 3770: yes sure
17/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 980 3770: okay sure
17/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 980 3770: everything is clear
17/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 980 3770: l am not aware ,l need some more information
17/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 8:06 am - +263 77 980 3770: yes sure l am now clear
18/10/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
18/10/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263774050858 @263779803770 @263773902140?
20/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Takunda,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Takunda's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, may I know if we are still connected @263774050858 @263779803770 @263773902140?
20/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Good evening. I am connected now.
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, may I know if you are clear so far?
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 390 2140: To me it's clear
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 390 2140: I think they can't
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Of course, yes. There are other options to a productive life
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Yes
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 390 2140: I think it's best to continue with Takunda on board. Right now I cant get hold of him.
20/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, if student are not available parents can also attend the discussions on their behalf and it is completely alright.
20/10/23, 11:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.

1. Edoofa is an educational organization that has worked with over 250 universities, schools, and colleges for more than 13 years. They've earned a $10 million scholarship fund from government-recognized educational institutions to make education affordable for deserving students. Edoofa's "Earn While You Learn" program sets students up for long-term success. They've secured 2100 seats in prestigious Indian universities, making them more industry-oriented. Edoofa's scholarship program is a result of its academic board's ability to find the right students and improve their job readiness. Success stories strengthen their credibility and partnerships. Edoofa aims to impact millions of lives and invites genuine admission seekers passionate about education.
26/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Yes, please it is possible to choose a university before the results, as this will secure you an early seat in the university and if Takunda achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

3. Once a student reserves his/ her seat with the university the student account is automatically linked with the university accounts and whenever you wish to redeem those credits you can talk with your EWYL mentor, and they will help you with that.

4. Every university has its own medical policy, all the universities provide you with medical Insurance which would cost $50 per annum, please.
26/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope I was able to answer all your queries.
26/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 405 0858: We can continue
26/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
26/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Clear
26/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Understood
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Takunda will respond, I am his parent
26/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am aware of that. As Takunda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 55 students have already secured their seats, leaving 45 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Takunda is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 405 0858: I get your point mam,so far so good I don't have any queries we can go ahead
26/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Thank you mam.stay blessed
14/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Takunda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 390 2140: Good morning. Thank you.

I have some issues of concern, please clarify:
1. Will you share other options to choose from?

2. Are hostel fees paid per semester or per year?

3. Do the deposits we made earlier contribute in any way to the bills shared above?
15/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please thank you for sharing your concerns, rest assured as we discuss the letter in detail, everything will be cleared to you.
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Ok mam we are following
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 405 0858: (1)tution after scholarship $900
(2)duration of course 4 yrs
(3)admission  $300
(4)reg fee $750
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Well understood,from the above mentioned issues raise especially issue item 1 if we can have an option of choosing universities it will much easier for us to discuss basing on choice
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 405 0858: I am getting you quite well mam, my worry is considering the time frame for paying the registration fees is too close that the student won't have time to select the university of choice.again considering the fees and accommodation there is a real need for a student to compare
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Thank you. Please refresh me on what those other fares we deposited earlier were meant to cover.
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your concern here, if I were at your place I would have the same concerns, and @263773902140 I will get back to your query as well, let me help you understand better.
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
16/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
18/11/23, 8:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your concerns?
18/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 405 0858: My apology mam,my network was very very bad since yesterday  after I have read your messages.
18/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 405 0858: I didn't know of the transfer after payment of registration fee
18/11/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that network can be a challenge. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
20/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 405 0858: We are opting for the better university in the first place,I was thinking Edoofa schoolarship program is there to help the under privillaged  students,but now the fee structure and accommodation is very high as in the case of Takunda $900/semester  + $1200 per month rentals *12 months* *4 years.
20/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 405 0858: He is the sponsor of the student, you may address his question
20/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I understand that he needs an answer to the concerns he shared, first of all, thank you for sharing these queries with me I am glad to see that you were able to go through your offer letter and note all of these down rest assured that as we move forward we would be discussing all these queries the purpose of scheduling our discussion today was to help you understand the offer letter better and address any queries that you might have now that you have shared these queries you can be rest assured that these would be covered, please. 

Moving forward I would like to inform you that as we start with our discussion I'll help you understand the letter if at the end there is any query that is unattended then we can cater to that as well. So I would please want you to be available tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT with out delays so we can discuss the letter in detail first, please.
21/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Takunda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 390 2140: I am multi-tasking but following
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 390 2140: I saw those other fees
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Copied
21/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Yes please
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Thank you for the explanation. May you, please, share a breakdown of all the amounts to be paid before studies commence. After effecting the stated discounts and deductions
21/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Before I state that, let us discuss the payment modes as well. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 390 2140: I work in Harare most of my time
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Thank you. Hoping to get answers to earlier questions
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I will and you are welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Do you understand why we're asking you the questions and insisting on getting the answers from you?
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 390 2140: It looks like money takes highest priority here
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I completely understand, that you want to plan out the finances, however, as I mentioned above Before I state the breakdown, let us discuss the payment modes as well so that you have clarity with the modes.
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, it is nothing like that, it is alright if you wish to discuss the breakdown first, its just that I wanted to have a discussion in a way where the flow of conversation is understandable, however, it is alright we can discuss the modes later. 

Let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 390 2140: Another issue is that we would like to see if this Edoofa option is cheaper than Zim education as touted
21/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 405 0858: Accommodation is now $800 down from $1200 per month on out of campus residence,it's fine.The student is under EWYL programe,hoping to ease the fees,where does the later come in to effect to reduce the costs?
21/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since our available hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm, I hope you will be available considering there is a deadline as well with the offer letter, I hope you will prioritize this discussion. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, could you please let me know a time by when will you be available to connect. I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.

24/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry could you please help me understand which queries, please, since I have shared the cost break down of the per annum cost with @263773902140 and he was able to acknowledge the same as well?
