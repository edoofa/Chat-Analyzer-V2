I hope you are doing well, and had a fruitful weekend. For the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end and this prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.

 May I please know the underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing?

For the past few weeks, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end and this prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application as the academic board itself is present in the group.

 Could you please help me understand the reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us with the challenges you're facing? @263773031875 @263713184079 ?

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Good afternoon ma'am I have read the above and understood
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
24/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am we did not have network but tommorow we will be available
