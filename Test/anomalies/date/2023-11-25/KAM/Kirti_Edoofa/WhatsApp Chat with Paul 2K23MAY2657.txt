01/08/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 710 1974: Zimbabwe hasn't yet adapted to the use of electricity and  it is one of the countries that doesn't have well advanced technology. In most developed countries they are using artificial intelligence but in Zimbabwe right now we are not yet into that and also Zimbabwe's economic development continues to be hampered by price and exchange rate instability missalocation of productive resources, high informality,low investment and limited structural transformation . I see myself as one of the leading electrians in Zimbabwe and I want to change my country in terms of technology, I won't be doing this alone, I will  look for engineers with the  same goal as mine which is to make our country a better place
01/08/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (private limited) is a state owned company whose task is to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in Zimbabwe. It has organized this task by  delegation to its subsidiaries, the energy generating company Zimbabwe Power Company and the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company. ZESA is the only power generator and supplier for the public grid, for many years the company has failed to produce enough power to meet the demands that's why load shedding is used on a routine basis and some rural areas don't have electricity over long periods
The economy is hampered by the unforeseeable energy situation . As an electrical engineer who's aspiring to work for the ZESA company I will look for an alternative way to overcome all this .
ZESA is my dream company because due to the situations in Zimbabwe ZESA is not able to meet the demand of electricity in the country and I want to make a change, to remove the schedule of load shedding
01/08/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Paul.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing question 2 and 3, I shall wait for your response for the last two questions and the SOP form.
01/08/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 710 1974: •Electrical devices convert electrical energy into other forms of energy, for example heat, light or sound. Electronic devices control the flow of electrons in order to perform a task.
• The term Electrical deals with the flow of electrical power or charge, whereas electronics deals with the flow of electrons.
•An audio system, TV, or any Mp3 player is the example of an electronic system. The sound waves are converted to electrical signals and they are amplified to process the output of high strengthened audio signals, through speakers.
•Electrical devices convert electrical energy into another form of energy like light or sound. Electronic devices control the flow of electrons for performing a task like amplification or calculations.
01/08/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 710 1974: *How a capacitor works*
• unlike the battery, a capacitor is a circuit component that stores electrical energy through distributing charged particles on plates to create a potential difference. 
• to charge a capacitor you attach a battery, which at first adds a single electron to one side of the capacitor. The electron has an electric field that repels other electrons and this field reaches through space and pushes on the electrons in the other plate, causing that plate to acquire an induced positive charge
•overtime the capacitor's terminal voltage rises to meet the applied voltage from the source and the current through the capacitor decreases correspondingly. Once the capacitor has reached the full voltage of the source, it will stop drawing current from it and behave essentially as an open circuit.

01/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the questions, may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form by now?
01/08/23, 10:55 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I filled it. Is it not this one
02/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah that's true
02/08/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
02/08/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah I'm ready
02/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
02/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
02/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah true
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Ok noted
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah
02/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
02/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah understood
02/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
02/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes it is clear
02/08/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes I'm following
02/08/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
02/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 710 1974: So far I have no questions
02/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
02/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Ok noted
03/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Paul.

21/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 355 9893: Im readly available

21/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I don't know exactly about the edoofa program but im going to generalize. Students need to fill out and submit their applications, including things like transcripts, letters of recommendation, test scores, essays, and other supporting documents. Once their applications are submitted, they will receive decisions from the schools they applied to, and can choose which one to attend.
21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.

23/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I'm available now
23/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
23/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
23/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah that's true
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 710 1974: So does it mean I'll just receive one offer letter
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: yes, please. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
23/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
23/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

23/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I'm done
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Paul, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
23/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Understood so the offer will come when
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would encourage you to be patient please, as we move ahead step by step all your queries will be cleared.
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Understood
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Paul,

30/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 710 1974: No I dont

17/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah I'll be there
17/11/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
18/11/23, 6:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Paul!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah I read it sir
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 710 1974: But I've some questions pertaining the letter
18/11/23, 7:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, may I know if you have gone through this message of mine as well?
18/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sure
18/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sir I read it
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 710 1974: 1 :1000 usd
2:  4 years
3 : 300
4 : 750
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000* 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah so they just offer 50%
18/11/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here. May you please clarify again what do you wish to ask?
18/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 710 1974: On that letter they wrote  tuition fee after scholarship and the deducted amount was 50%
18/11/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. The university has offered you with a 50% scholarship please, this means that you have to cater for the rest of the 50%. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 710 1974: OK understood
18/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 710 1974: What about the issue of registration fee
18/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that moving ahead during our discussion here. Moving ahead, I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Understood so this money is not on the tuition fee
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah for sure
18/11/23, 8:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes we can move forward
18/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I've a question
18/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 710 1974: What happens if I don't pay within the given 15 days
18/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 710 1974: But sir I was once told that the edoofa is the one which caters for the scholarship and accommodation but now it seems as if the scholarship is coming from a school
18/11/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. On that note, I have taken note of the concern that you have shared here, and stay assured that we will discuss more about that moving ahead. Before that, let us aim towards completing the discussion about the offer letter here so that we can all get proper clarity about it and we would be on the same page. I hope you wold also wish to cooperate in that, right?
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah true
18/11/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
20/11/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Paul!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 710 1974: I will be there
20/11/23, 8:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. I'm glad 1 PM works for you. I look forward to our continued discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University at the scheduled time now.
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paul!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah I'm ready sir
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please Paul. Now, in order to begin our discussion here today, I would firstly help you in understanding the queries that you had shared with me here. Shall we begin?
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah let's begin
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, coming to the first query of yours, I would like to mention that when it comes to the registration fee, there is not only the option of 15 days, there is a payment plan as well that you have got within the benefits of the Endowment Plan, and we will discuss that moving ahead, I hope you are clear till here, right?
20/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sir understood
20/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, coming to your second query, I would like to mention that. I am sure you recall that the per annum cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000. However, with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, which effectively reduces your cost of education to just $2000 to $3000 per year which not only includes your tuition fee but also your accommodation fee, cost of food and other basic expenses such as 24/7 wifi, electricity and water bills. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: This brings your per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 and if you see, this amount of $2800 falls within the range that was shared with you early on. I hope with this above break up, the query you had has been addressed and now you have a better perspective?
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir thank you
20/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 710 1974: I've a question 
Is it the school or the edoofa program which is providing the scholarship
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Coming to that, I would like to mention that the scholarship is provided by the University, however, it is due to the fact that you are an Edoofian, you were able to get access to that scholarship. Because it is not offered to normal students right away. I hope you have understood the same now?
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 710 1974: So edoofa is not offering me anything
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paul!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir we can continue
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Paul, moving ahead, as I have already helped you in understanding that since the universities are partnered with Edoofa, that is why you are able to get scholarship from their side. 

Now, on that note, may you please help me in understanding that why is it that you think Edoofa is not offering you anything?
21/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 710 1974: When I joined this program I heard and they told me that they offer scholarships (the edoofa program) so now I wasn't understanding why is it that I'm getting the scholarship from the school
21/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 710 1974: So meaning my scholarship percentage will not ascend from 50
21/11/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Paul. When you joined the Edoofa program, the intention was to assist you in securing a scholarship through its university partnerships. However, it's essential to note that we here enable our students to get scholarships by providing guidance and opportunities for students like you.

The scholarship you've received from Galgotias University is a result of Edoofa's collaboration and association with the university, thereby granting you a 50% scholarship.
21/11/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I would also like to mention that when it comes to the scholarship percentage, it would be subject to revision once you will receive your A-Level Resutsl, therefore, you can as well get a higher quantum of scholarship at a leter stage. I hope this is clear?
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Crystal clear sir thank you
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Sir I've a question on this registration fee 
If I don't pay this fee am l still in the edoofa program
21/11/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, Paul. It's important to understand that being part of the Edoofa program doesn't hinge solely on the payment of the registration fee. However, securing your scholarship seat at Galgotias University is directly linked to paying the registration fee within the stipulated time frame.

All students in our program become part of Edoofa because they aspire to pursue higher education at esteemed universities in India and globally. The registration fee acts as a pathway to ensure your seat and scholarship at the university. I hope you get the point here, right?
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir thank you sir
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 710 1974: So am I gonna connect direct to the university administration or I connect with them through edoofa
21/11/23, 2:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that till the time you arrive here in India, connecting with the university administration will primarily be facilitated through Edoofa because, at all times, the officials of the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa stay at the university campus to make sure all the communication can be clear and prompt. I hope this is understood?
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sir understood <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I hope you are also clear till here so that we can proceed?
21/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sir
21/11/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sure sir
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah sir understood
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 710 1974: No but my dad stays there
21/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Ok thank you sir
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used i.e. Paying using Mukuru through Mr. Shorwi. Now, if you wish to make the payment through Mr. Shorwi, you can either do it using his FBC Bank Details and making a cash deposit to that, or by using the same mode, i.e. Mukuru.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir
21/11/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 710 1974: What about giving money to Mr Rajan <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Understood sir so this is for off campus
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir understood
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Paul!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paul!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter, may I know by when can we reconnect with each other so that we can proceed to the next part of our discussion and complete the same?
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yes sir sure
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please dear. Now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 710 1974: Yeah we are clear
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 710 1974: No sir I've no queries
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I would like to share an important update with you here. Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Kirti, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Friday.
