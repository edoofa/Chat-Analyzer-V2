06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ruth,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Ruth's higher education?

10/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Ruth.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few weeks, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263719749119 @263775987016 @263785661672 ?
11/10/23, 5:33 am - +263 78 566 1672: Morning Ma'am. We are all well thank you. Please note that Ruth is starting her final exams this coming week and she has been under a lot of pressure. Am also engaged in my first half semester exams so can we do this later.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. Good morning! Thank you for the update. It's completely understandable that you both have academic commitments. Focus on your exams. However, please understand that we want you to connect because the 2024 admissions are now open only through Edoofa, and I do not want Ruth to miss this opportunity in such a case, what we can do is connect on Saturdays for 2 hours, where the work and study pressure is also less and you will be able to take out 2 hours easily. Does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
11/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and I would love to answer your concern here however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
14/10/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Please accept my apologies for the delay in connecting as I had a busy schedule at work. I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?

24/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes we are
24/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
24/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Step 5... The Admission Process. It sorely depends on the Earn While You Learn Program. To complete the application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare me for Statement of Purpose and then send it to their various Partner Universities.

Once you receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where my scholarship and fees would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, I  would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that i could start reducing my annual fee while I'll be in their country .
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
24/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 598 7016: No I don't
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond.
