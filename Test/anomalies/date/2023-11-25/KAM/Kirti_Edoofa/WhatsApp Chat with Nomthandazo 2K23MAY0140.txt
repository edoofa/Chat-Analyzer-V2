04/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 371 8976: Good morning Mr Harmehack. I hope I find you well. We are fine this side, except the challenges of our country as you know.
I'm sure you realize that Nomthandazo has been quiet for some time, not proceeding with her EWYL programme. We were advised to pay $750 to book Nomthandazo's place in university. So this was a big blow in our heads. We cannot afford that much. As it is, we had borrowed that $350 administration fee and we are  failing to repay the debt. We are even thinking of asking you if it's possible for you to give us back the money so that we repay the debt. So then there is nowhere where we can get the $750 even if you give us a payment plan. It's difficult. She will try to do other courses here which don't need money like nursing, police, etc. As parents we are very sorry for the inconvenience. We are stuck because of lack of money. Thank you
04/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 340 6804: Good morning everyone
06/09/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nomthandazo.

I hope you are doing well, I understand completely where you are coming from as a parent and it must be a challenge. However, here if you consider Nomthandazo's future and see the bigger picture, if she does any course there if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for her to make her employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education Nomthandazo will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?

24/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that since you mentioned about the challenges that you have, could you please help me understand your challenges better so that I can assist you?
24/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 340 6804: Well we sat down with my parents and came to à conclusion of not continuing with this program. The reason for that decision is based on the financial challenges my parents are facing now in terms of one of them losing a job and one salary taking care of me and my siblings. As we calculated, we so it best for me to study in Zimbabwe because that would reduce a lot of financial problems because my parents are already in debt with the $350  money they used to pay for holding a seat in this program.

24/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 340 6804: My father
24/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, may I know what was his previous job about?
