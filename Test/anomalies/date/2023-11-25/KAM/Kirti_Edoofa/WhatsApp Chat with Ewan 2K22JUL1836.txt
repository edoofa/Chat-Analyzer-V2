19/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 979 7389: You mean this one.
19/10/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I was able to go through it I don't know if we can go through it together .
19/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 979 7389: In brief
19/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help you recall the steps. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
19/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please feel free to ask any concerns that you have so far?
19/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Do u have many university's.
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 979 7389: When your students finish there degrees do you offer them jobs or u send them back?
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please Edoofa as an Organization is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities. Yes, indeed, after completing your degree in India, you will have the opportunity to seek employment there. As an organization, we are committed to your success. We have colleges that offer placement programs, connecting students with well-known companies that provide job opportunities. The EWYL program is a crucial component in this process. Not only does it allow you to earn credits, but it also equips you with essential 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability upon completing your studies.

I trust that this explanation addresses your query.
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Thank you for the information.
19/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 979 7389: It's accurate he want to do Mechanical Engineering and we are looking forward that he will be in Indian by August 2024
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I hope to receive this in time so that will be able to meet the demand in time
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 979 7389: It's not possible but we are looking forward to be enrolled in the best university.
19/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 979 7389: We are looking forward to a favorable response
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Is it possible for you to give us a list of university according to their performances.
19/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Yes we discussed about it.
19/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Does this money include accommodation
19/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have love to continue our discussion and answer your query. However, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
20/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 979 7389: Good morning . I will be available.
20/10/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ewan,

21/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
23/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ewan,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ewan,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Good day I'm sorry I was out of town had to rush for an emergency .
25/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Good day , will be available tomorrow from 9 am
25/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, can I anticipate that you will be available to connect with us at 12:30 pm tomorrow without any delays?
25/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 979 7389: It okay
25/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
25/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Have a pleasant evening.
26/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I will be comfortable with  the structure
26/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 979 7389: As for the $750  we haven't receive the due date.
26/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we move ahead we will share everything please do not worry.
26/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Its okay I thought maybe I missed it somewhere.
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 979 7389: We really appreciate this EWYL programme
26/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I think  for now it's quite clear.
26/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 979 7389: We thank you for your support and patience.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Good evening. I'm free to proceed I have reviewed the benefits
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ewan, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Following
26/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Yes
26/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Good day. I'm available it's just that today the network is bad.
27/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 979 7389: As for Ewan he is school he will be finishing his Exams on 27 November meaning he will be coming home first of December.
27/10/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please parents can also continue with the discussion on behalf of the students. May I know if you are clear so far?
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I'm clear.
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Not it clear.
27/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 979 7389: In mean to say it clear.
27/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 979 7389: It's clear
27/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Ewan,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 979 7389: Mrng very sorry today I won't be available today it's Sabbath.
30/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Can you provide me with more information.
30/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
30/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Following
30/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Network is bad today.
30/10/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Which is true
30/10/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 979 7389: I think I will be comfortable to benefit number 6 but as for now we're looking at 9 points and above according to his performance.
30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure he will make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 979 7389: It's clear but will be disappointed in him.
30/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Yes it clear.
30/10/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Its well but as for now we are not looking forward to number 3
30/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure he will not such a situation arise. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Thank you very much will be looking forward to your favourable response.
14/11/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

16/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 631 4015: Following
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 979 7389: 1.4 years
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 979 7389: 2. 2000 Us
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to all the questions.
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 979 7389: 3.300 USD
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 979 7389: 4. They is a registration fee of $750 which will once discussed that it have been reduced by the grant of $150.
16/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we will be getting to that point as well. Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1-00, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Yes
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 631 4015: Noted thanks
16/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 979 7389: Following
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 631 4015: What are other universities offering ?
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776314015 as of now your application has been accepted by Galgotia's University once we receive an update from other universities I shall notify you as well.
16/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Hie I can't join the 1315hours session I'm currently traveling
16/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please may I know by when will you be available to connect with us?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 631 4015: Noted thank you . Now my understanding of all of this is that fkr Ewan to join Galgotia we need approximately $4500
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 631 4015: When is this money needed by for next year intake
16/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 979 7389: From my understanding I think it's $2000 tuition fee and $750 once payment the other $2500 is being covered by the scholarship
16/11/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776314015 no please, I would encourage you to be a little patient and discuss the letter step by step and every concern of your shall be covered in detail as we go through the letter so may I know if you are available?
17/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ewan

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond although I noticed that you were able to go through my message. May I know if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Yes we are
17/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Yes currently I am
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Yes I am
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Yes yes
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 470 8325: Yes please
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ewan,

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since our available hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm, I hope you will be available considering there is a deadline as well with the offer letter, I hope you will prioritize this discussion. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 1:22 am - +263 71 470 8325: Sorry sorry
