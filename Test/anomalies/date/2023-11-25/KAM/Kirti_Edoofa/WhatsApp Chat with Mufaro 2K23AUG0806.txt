Thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form, I did go through your form and I noticed that you have mentioned that the amount of Edoofa program fee that you were asked to pay is $3500.

22/08/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
22/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Yes I am available
22/08/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I'm ready
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I have gone through the process
22/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
22/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 754 4092: The 2 steps are clear
22/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you
22/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Roughly, how long will these steps take bearing in mind Step 5 which requires registration fee of 500 to 700$
22/08/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263777544092 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
22/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes please
22/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes ready now
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

23/08/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mufaro.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you were able to go through the videos/ audios by now?
23/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I have watched the videos and also heard audio discussions from the Founders
23/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes, I have done it
23/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
23/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. My understanding of the discussions in the videos is that the Founders of Edoofa share with us what qualities a successful Edoofian student should possess. This is a student who would have secured s scholarship and has earned scholarship credits.                   Furthermore in the videos they also share the Edoofa vision and talk about traits that differentiate a successful student from the rest of other students who do not have the Edoofa scholarship.                 3.The founders proceed on to talk about schools, colleges and universities and their experiences of what is taking place in these schools and also what experiences students in these schools have.                   4.One other crucial discussion in the videos is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP).It is a necessary step towards securing a scholarship. Basically, it demands why the student is worthy of a scholarship or admission in school. This also includes solid achievements, unique traits of the student. His goals, vision, academic progress and also why the student chose that particular Course.
23/08/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
23/08/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
23/08/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
23/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very very much for clarification on some omitted points
23/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
23/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I am ready
23/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
23/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

29/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: The differences between the electrical and electronic devices are:
Electrical devices convert electrical energy into heat, light, sound, or motion using metals like copper and aluminum for current conductivity. The electric device cannot make a decision. For example, light bulbs, generators. Electrical devices require more electrical power at high voltage drawing high current. Therefore, electrical devices have more safety issues associated because they might cause a high-voltage electric shock. Common examples include electric fans, light bulbs, heaters, motors, generators, and transformers.
Electronic devices control electron flow for tasks like signal amplification, information coding, and data processing. They can make decisions. For example, electronic devices like mobile phones, computers and digital watches. All electronic devices are made up of two types of electronic elements namely, active elements like batteries, cells, and passive elements like resistors, capacitors and inductors. Electronic devices utilizes semiconductor materials like silicon and germanium. They operate on low direct current (DC) and are smaller, less power-consuming, and safer than electrical devices. Common electronic devices include computers, smartphones, LED lamps, digital watches, transistors, diodes, microprocessors, and amplifiers.
29/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Question 5
A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field, consisting of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric. When voltage is applied, opposite charges accumulate on the plates.
Charging a capacitor involves the movement of electrons, with electrons from the negative terminal attracted to the positive plate and an equal number from the negative plate flowing to the positive terminal, creating an electric field between the plates with an excess of negative and positive charges. The capacitor is fully charged when the potential difference between its plates equals the applied voltage, storing electrical energy in the form of an electric field between its plates.
A capacitor discharges its stored energy by allowing electrons to flow from the negative plate to the positive plate, creating a current. The rate of discharge depends on its capacitance, which measures its ability to store charge. Capacitors with higher capacitances store more charge and discharge at a slower rate, while those with lower capacitances store less charge and discharge at a faster rate.
A capacitor stores electrical energy in an electric field and releases it when connected to a circuit, serving various purposes in electronic devices like smoothing voltage fluctuations, blocking DC voltage, and serving as a timing element.
29/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Since I was doing my research hurriedly due to powercuts, today I have managed to improve on my research. We're still experiencing poor Network here. Good  day. Stay blessed

29/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to share the statement of Entry for A- level?
29/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 208 2484: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation, it is duly noted with us, however, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of Entry for A- level?
29/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Thank you as for statement of A Level it's in the Head's office.To ask for it when we open School on Monday 4 September 2023,then l forward it to you the very opening week.
29/08/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, we can start with our discussion and once you are able to collect the statement of entry for A- level on 4th september you can share it in the group, does this plan sound acceptable to you? <This message was edited>
29/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Yes
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents, while we wait for the statement of entry for A-level. The rest is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/08/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Yes. Thank you
29/08/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
29/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Yes thank you to hear that.Stay blessed
29/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
29/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
29/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/08/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Thank you. We're hoping for the best university.
29/08/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
29/08/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
29/08/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
29/08/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you for the information. We hope for the best, through your assistance
29/08/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes we discussed the issue with my Counsellor. Thank you.
29/08/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
29/08/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Yes understood
29/08/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
29/08/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Understood
29/08/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Yes I am following
29/08/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
29/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 208 2484: My query is now on when the admission fee is wanted so that we make preparations
29/08/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, let me help you understand. Indeed, I understand that you will need to make the necessary preparations, once you share your pending document which is the Statement of entry for A- level on the 4th of September 2023, we shall start with your EWYL Program and your admission process, and for a rough idea, you can consider Mid- September. 

I hope we are clear here?
29/08/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Thank you
29/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you on Monday to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday as well so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
04/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 754 4092: How are you. I'm fine

I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure?
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mufaro,

I trust you're in good health. I was anticipating a response from you yesterday but haven't received one yet. Is there something that's been hindering you from replying, @263777544092 @263782082484 ?

11/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes I went through the pictures
11/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Registration process... I pay registration fee to reserve a scholarship seat. The registration fee amounts to 500-750 USD
11/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
11/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. My query now is when the registration fee is due.
11/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, as we move ahead with our discussion, your query shall be answered may I know if you are available to move ahead now?
11/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes , but for the next 30 minutes
11/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Uuuh this is great great news to me and my family. Thank you so much. God bless you for being my mentor and helpful advisor. I'm delighted to hear this news.
11/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I'm going to analyze them one by one slowly and come back to you. Thank you.
11/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall wait for your response.
11/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I expect my A Level results in January 2024.When do I have to pay the registration fee or Endowment grant. Is it after receiving the offer letter?
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we discuss the benefits in detail, you shall understand your query better, may I know if you are ready?
11/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you but I'm sleepy now. I wish we can continue tomorrow if possible.
11/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Of course, getting a good night's sleep is important. We can continue our conversation tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
11/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes, definitely I will be available. Good night.
12/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes available now . Good afternoon.
12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are ready to start with the discussion of the endownment program?
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes please
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Mufaro, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Amazing indeed! I'm an Edoofian. That was dream of my life. This is exhilarating indeed! God bless you.
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words moving ahead with the second benefit.

*2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 754 4092: The explanation resonates with me perfectly. I do appreciate it.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I truly appreciate this and the explanation resonates with me.
12/10/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
13/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mufaro.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I'm available
13/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
13/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I'm clear with the above and am prepared.
13/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Please provide me with more information on it. I will appreciate it.
13/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
13/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
14/10/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Mufaro.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you yesterday, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
14/10/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 754 4092: Good morning. We are still connected. I sent my response late yesterday xx
14/10/23, 10:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please may I know if we can connect now?
14/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 754 4092: Yes please
14/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
16/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mufaro,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I have understood the minimum entry points to higher learning institutions
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I agree with Benefits 5 and 6 but not to put a stop to my academic career.
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure, such a situation will never occur, and Mufaro will make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Very clear now. It's encouraging.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes I am clear on the above.
16/10/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I understand that but my wish is to complete my University education
16/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure Mufaro will make you proud. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good evening. Thank you for the questions. Yes I want to know more about the admission process unfolds and whether the costs will be the 500-750 dollars
16/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, every university has its own registration fee, however, to be on the safer side we suggest parents to prepare for $750, so that if the registration fee is less than $750 the finances can be adjusted in future, I hope we are clear now?
16/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. It's now clear to me.
16/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Mufaro's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Mufaro is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes yes please we're very excited and pleased to benefit from this program. Honestly we have been together from far.
16/10/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
16/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you too. I also need some rest.
17/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. Hope you are fine.
17/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mufaro.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
17/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Yesterday you said Universities will take 3 to 5 days  to evaluate applications. Did I get you correct? Anxiety!
17/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, however, this time is only for the evaluation of the applications, and every university has its own evaluation time as well.
17/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Okay,fine.
17/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 208 2484: Okay thank you.
02/11/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mufaro,

I am pleased to announce that your application has been successfully reviewed and accepted by one of the prestigious institutions, *Gulzar Group Of Institutions* in India. Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
02/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

02/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 6:11 am - +263 77 754 4092: Good morning. Thank you very much for the exhilarating news. We are all excited about this opportunity for MUFARO TABENI to study in lndia.        We will be available for the session at 8 pm today. Once again thank you.

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your university admission formalities. For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
03/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Let us meet at 8 pm for the session.
03/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I have gone through the letter.
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Surely l have some questions to ask for clarification. We can proceed.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Question 1.Tuition fees is 3500$ then less 65% scholarship credit=1225$.              2.Accommodation/hostel fee=1200$ per annum.                    3.Registration fee=750$
03/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding Mufaro's offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, his annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you for the clarification. However, my questions are 1.The above letter was issued on 19.10.2023 and has a life span of 15 working days for me to pay 750$.ls this the date l should follow?        2.Last time I paid money through FBC Bank in Zimbabwe using Mr Jerera's account . Is it the same procedure or not?
03/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, please do not worry about the deadlines, we will be covering that as well and will also discuss the payment modes in detail.
03/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very much for the clarification.
03/11/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
03/11/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
03/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 754 4092: This sounds splendid and very attractive and encouraging. I wish it's a dream come true.
03/11/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with Mufaro's annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that Mufaro will receive as part of the university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you
03/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I am with you and understand everything.
03/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Mufaro's tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 11:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 12:08 am - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I had fell  asleep. I will be available tomorrow at 0830 hours.
04/11/23, 5:32 am - +263 77 754 4092: ... had fallen asleep
04/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

07/11/23, 11:58 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good evening. Surely l understand the importance of the offer letter and deadlines outlined. I'm ready for discussions although it might be late now.
07/11/23, 11:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is past our available hours now, so we will be connecting tomorrow same time.
08/11/23, 12:00 am - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Good night.
08/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 754 4092: How are you?
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?

08/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by the Gulzar Group of Institutions. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutions as a collective?
08/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Surely, as a family we discussed the offer letter and what it entails to us. Honestly we cannot wait to grab the opportunity for our son to be offered an opportunity from the Gulzar Group of lnstitutions.
08/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
08/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. 1.Our thoughts and feelings are that MUFARO TABENI must not lose this opportunity to go to lndia for University education under Edoofa.           2.Everyone here is excited that MUFARO has been accorded the opportunity for tertiary education outside of Zimbabwe. Great news to us.
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
08/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. We wanted to further clarification on accommodation, food, dressing, library fee, water and electricity bills etc. How are these catered for under Edoofa?
08/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, let me help you understand. Ideally, a scholarship is only on tuition fees and covers only that part of the university, however, since you are enrolled through Edoofa, these costs are factored in the total costs and that is why the fee range of $2000-$3000 we discussed not only covered the tuition fee but also the above mentioned costs and facilities.
08/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very much for the clarification. My family is here with me as l read out your reply.
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
08/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. Surely l have to contact her more information although what you are doing is just but great.
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
08/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 754 4092: My plan was to contact Mr Rajan and pay the first instalment of 300 plus the 7% of handling fee.
