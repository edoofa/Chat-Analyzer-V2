25/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this form, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
25/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Noted
25/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Please note, that it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, if you as a student are not available your parents/ guardians can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on your behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
25/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as your participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if you are occupied with exams, your parents on your behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 31st of October, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program.

If we delay the process you will certainly fall behind your peers and even lose to chance to start the EWYL program's first batch which is on the 31st of October, and I do not wish for that.
25/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Okay.l will try to make the whole process way quicker

26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes, let's get started
26/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 912 6153: I have gone through the photo
26/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,this is all clear
26/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
26/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes, of course I'm following
26/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Well explained
26/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,let's start.That will be appreciable
26/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
26/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
26/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 604 7624: Good evening Mis Kirti. I hope you are doing well today. We are following up the conversation as a family
26/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes please do

27/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Prevail.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Good evening, Ms. kirti.Yes,we shall start
27/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 912 6153: How are you?
27/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
27/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,l did go through them repeatedly for better understanding.
27/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Firstly, the first video was a message to us students that we should follow instructions and be open-minded.The second video mainly focused on employability and it was said that higher education is a protocol with so many systems and policies. Being so the program's motive is not just to get the student admitted.And the persons capacity results in all success. 
Moreover, in the third video,it was said that many agents identify education as  business, which is quite wrong .The student's attitude, skill, and knowledge are the bedrock of the Edoofa Program. The program also enables students to find culture and friendship through Diwali. 
In conclusion, the last video advised students to be resourceful and cause zero delays. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
27/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
27/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
27/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
27/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Well noted.Thanks for sharing better knowledge
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now? <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes.We are on the same page
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 02:30 PM.
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Thank you.Same your side ,goodnight, and keep safe.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Prevail, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Well understood
30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,this is clear as well.
30/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
30/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 912 6153: This is perfectly noted
30/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 912 6153: This is clear as well
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 912 6153: No,not at all.
30/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes, indeed, I'm much more thrilled for the next steps and the offer letter, too.
30/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Have a great night too,keep safe and stay blessed
03/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Good afternoon, Ms. Kirti and all. How are you doing today?I would like to inform you that my EWYL group has been inactive since yesterday till now. Can you kindly help me out with this. <This message was edited>

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, MVN University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

16/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 912 6153: 1.USD1250
2.USD 0
3.USD0
4.USD 250
5.USD1000 *[minus $150 endowment grant = 850]* <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please check and answer question1 again?
16/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 912 6153: It's USD 0
16/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,actually, it's one
16/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
16/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Now, I understand way better
16/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of prevail's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund

I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 604 7624: Good evening, Ms. Kirti and all Edoofa members. I'm doing well and have been following the conversation with Prevail. Thanks for the admission update and stuff. However, honestly the guy is quite unhappy with the university you gave him so far thus he was expecting an university with a global rank of 1000 and below. According to the research we have made as a family, MVN University ranks around 11000 out of 14000 something. From my viewpoint, the fact that the university was established in 2012 depict that it's still in infancy. So can you kindly help us out find a better one.
16/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your response tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Genuinely saying, I'm quite unhappy with the idea of MVN university since l had expectations of a university with better global rankings.Would you kindly help me find a good one more than this ,that is a university with a global rank of maybe 1000 and below,along those lines.Thank you
16/11/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789126153 we shall discuss your concern tomorrow at the scheduled time I will help you understand better. Have a great night ahead.
17/11/23, 6:12 am - +263 78 912 6153: Thank you for your time, and enjoy the rest of your night.Goodnight until we get in touch again
17/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Good afternoon, Ms. kirti and all. I'm okay,thanks for asking. Yes,we can now start
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your query yesterday. I can see you are someone who really likes to have a deep understanding of what they have been offered, however, this is not true, in India, there are more than 1000 universities and not every university is a right fit, if I would have been at your place I would also have googled randomly however this is not the case here, please. 

Being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for you.
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And rest assured I shall be sharing university insights with you for your better understanding also so that you can actually go through the right insights.
17/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 912 6153: l do really hear you well, but with all due respect, MVN University is not a right for me.
17/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Okay
17/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand @263789126153.  Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
17/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
17/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
17/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
17/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yes,I'm clear about that, ma'am. 
However, from our analysis as family, MVN University isn't good enough for me, and l also want no affiliation with it,honestly .Being so,we better wait for responses from other universities. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 604 7624: Good day ms Kirti and all. We are doing well today this side.. As the family we would like to thank you for the conversation you are doing with our son Prevail.
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that @263789126153 however, I wish to explain something here, so I would encourage you to be patient please may I know if you are available to understand the same?
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Yeah,I'm all ears
17/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
17/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 912 6153: I'm quite aware of that
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, since you mentioned that you are aware of the transfer option I hope now you understand the importance of it while we wait updates from other universities as well?
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 912 6153: From my point of view, the transfer option will make the whole quite more complex. The bottom line here is that l get a better ranked university rather than choosing an institute, which is not of my preference. I'd better miss the opportunity from MVN,waiting for a good university.
17/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe the transfer option what you think is different. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
17/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 912 6153: It's much easier when you say it, but in practical terms, it will be something different,l know. And if l don't get a better scholarship offer anytime soon from any university, then that will be a bad coincidence.I don't want anything to do MVN, and l don't think l will reserve my scholarship seat because I'm not interested in it,unless I get a better university
17/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 912 6153: @917292063289 
Let's reconnect again between *20:00PM* onwards. I now have to attend a church service. Take care,have a great day further.
17/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 912 6153: Good evening, Ms. kirti and all.l hope l find you well this moment?
17/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263789126153 I completely understand what you are trying to say here, and it is fine if you do not wish to move ahead with MVN University, however, as per the update we received from the counseling team we were informed that your desire to get a high quantum of scholarship and let me inform you that you were offered a 100% scholarship, however, if you do not wish to move ahead with MVN, we do not have problem with it, but please understand the universities where we have shared your application with will not be offering you such a high quantum of scholarship. 

As per the updates we made sure that you get a high-quantum scholarship and we provided you with the same if that is not a concern we can definitely wait for other responses, however, if you lose this opportunity you may never get that back, please remember.
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 912 6153: This is well noted
17/11/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, since our available hours are now almost over I would like to reschedule our discussion to tomorrow 12:30 pm I hope you will be available tomorrow without any delays so that we can discuss a way ahead.
