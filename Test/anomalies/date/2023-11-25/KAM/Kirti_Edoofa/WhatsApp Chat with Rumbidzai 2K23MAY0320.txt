17/10/23, 11:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa.* In the past few months, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.

We acknowledge that you couldn't print the form due to electricity issues. I understand that this can be a challenge however, there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing, your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
17/10/23, 11:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in May 2023, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
17/10/23, 11:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @263771590700 @263717652617.
18/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Good afternoon 
Sorry for not communicating things have been  tough for us these last months. Rumbidzayi father left the job. So.for me I could not carry the burden of family needs ad.well.as the Educational needs
That is why we could not participate any more sorry about that its all.due to.financial.constraints
18/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I appreciate your honesty in sharing your family's financial challenges with us. It's important for us to be aware of the obstacles you are facing. Understanding your situation better can help us explore potential solutions to support Rumbidzai's educational journey. Could you please provide more details about the specific concerns and challenges you've encountered during these tough months, please?
25/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Rumbidzai,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. I am glad to hear that. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
28/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 765 2617: we will be available anytime
30/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai.

I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend, since we were unable to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Yes
30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, before we start please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
30/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Should they be in form of pictures
30/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.

31/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Yes
31/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600. <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Yes
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 765 2617: well received , thank you
31/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 765 2617: No l don't .
31/10/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Yes l am
31/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
31/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Thank you , have a blessed day ahead of you too.
31/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Waiting for this message
31/10/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: thank you for sharing the nation ID. It is duly noted with us.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

15/11/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Rmbidzai,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 765 2617: yes we have
15/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes it does
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 765 2617: 1. tuition fee after the scholarship is $900
2. Duration is 5 years (10 semesters).
3.$300
4.$750 registration fee
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes it does
15/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Noted
15/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes it does
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes l am
15/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes we are
15/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 159 0700: If you can pliz
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error above the *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Yes its clear  thank.you very much
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Yes we are in Harare
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Thank you so much l really appreciate it we will get in touch with.him.and also.we will be in touch.with you all the way thank you once again
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Yes please
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Alright I understand will go through it all when I reach home
15/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 159 0700: So may we discuss again tomorrow  about.the accommodation I asaw in the letter they mentioned about it
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can do that however, let us complete the letter discussion for now. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Yes I have
15/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Yes very much and am excited about it
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 159 0700: May I know what really transpires with
EWYL
15/11/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing her academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The earn-while-you-learn program is basically a program where students have the opportunity to learn new skills and perform projects consistently if they are consistent they will be able to earn scholarship credits which can further reduce their cost of education please.
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 159 0700: Well understood thank you
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 159 0700: I think.I understood well thank.you.very much if I have anything else to ask I will do so
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
21/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Rumbidzai,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 765 2617: Good morning Miss.Kirti , we are facing power cuts which lead to network problems.
Are there any other letters that are to come from other universities because l have done some research about Galgotias and i did not like somethings about it.
24/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rumbidzai.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. That is alright please, let me help you understand better and since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
24/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 765 2617: yes l am
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your query. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias  and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 765 2617: Yes l am
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
