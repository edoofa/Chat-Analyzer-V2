30/10/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group.

It's admirable that despite being in different locations for work, you both are committed to supporting her educational journey.
30/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
30/10/23, 8:56 pm - +258 84 646 4269: That's good
30/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
30/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday(07th November ) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Tuesday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
30/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
30/10/23, 9:01 pm - +258 84 646 4269: I will be available
30/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
30/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Patience 2K23OCT2098)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
30/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Patience EWYL23E0862)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
30/10/23, 9:10 pm - +258 84 646 4269: Yes thank you I've understood
30/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into her academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring her access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
30/10/23, 9:23 pm - +258 84 646 4269: The ADOOFA program helps reduce the actual cost of studying  abroad, ie, instead of paying $8000 we will only pay $3000 which is affordable. There is an opportunity of earning as you learn
30/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to know that our program was able to catch your eye. Our aim is to provide affordable education and make students employable ready. This cost reduction can be a significant relief for students and their families. Additionally, the opportunity to earn while you learn adds another valuable dimension to the program. It not only makes education more accessible but also provides practical experience and financial support during your studies.
30/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
30/10/23, 9:30 pm - +258 84 646 4269: Yes you can share
30/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I shall share 3 forms with you, please let me know once you have received them one by one.
30/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Feedback Form:* Your candid feedback is invaluable in our pursuit of excellence. This form offers you the chance to voice your opinions and suggestions. Print the form, write your feedback by hand, and affix a passport-sized photo as indicated. Once completed, you can scan the document or click a picture and share it with us here in your admission group. Please let me know if you have taken note of this and have received the document so that I can share the second form which is an online Google form.

30/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this form, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
30/10/23, 9:53 pm - +258 84 646 4269: Noted
30/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I can understand that Patience is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit her performance in the upcoming exams.
30/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
30/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if he is occupied with exams, you as parents on his behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 7th of November and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
31/10/23, 4:06 am - +258 84 646 4269: Yes we are together

02/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok I am ready we can start
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok thank you
02/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 389 4785: I am done
02/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok but what about the schools ,am I going to choose the school I want or you can choose for me
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
02/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes very explicit thank you well understood
02/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Clearly noted ,we can
02/11/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I do
02/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL). <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes they are very clear
02/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
02/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok you can share
02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
02/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

02/11/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:30 pm. I hope by that time you will be able to go through the videos by that time.
02/11/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the student application form , it is duly noted with us.
02/11/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
02/11/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok
03/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
03/11/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:00 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 389 4785: These videos are of the founders of Edoofa talking about the importance of Edoofa and the schools which are connected with Edoofa and the great works they have been doing for the past years and also about the interactive session with schools
04/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
04/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
05/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok I understand
05/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Thank you for this it is clear now
06/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you and on the weekends the team is not available. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?

06/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move her application ahead and help her to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on her application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require her availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
06/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in her admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

 Businesses contribute to economies by bringing growth and innovation to the community in which the business is established . It can also help stimulate economic growth by providing employment opportunities to people who may not be employable by large corporations.

11/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. That is alright please, I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

23/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 389 4785: Yes it's a Diploma in Business Administration.
23/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead towards the next step?
23/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I am available now.
23/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I am ready.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Alright.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Noted.
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Yes that's true.
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Alright thank you.
23/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Okay that's clear.
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 389 4785: Ok ! Yes we are.
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum

23/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
