01/11/23, 7:02 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: My own understanding
1. I think the founders will let the university know about me and then they will message me about the same
2. The university will send the statement of purpose
3. I will be counselled on university admission
4. We will receive an offer letter from university
5. Being registered and admission acceptance letter processed
6. Finally visa will be processed
01/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Right now no questions
01/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 8:26 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Wow that's amazing to hear
01/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 8:29 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Am following
01/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and Jce results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tiyamike, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 8:35 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Meaning i will expect to have interviews from university?
01/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, you may expect to have interviews with the universities as part of the admission process.
01/11/23, 8:39 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Well understood
01/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 8:43 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Nice to hear
01/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
01/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 8:48 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Well understood
01/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Am following
01/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 8:58 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: No queries right now
01/11/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 9:05 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: I can't wait for the next step
01/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/11/23, 9:07 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Thank you
08/11/23, 8:39 am - +265 886 73 55 77: Greetings of the day, how are you?
08/11/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tiyamike.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you have any thoughts of concerns to share?
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: We are still waiting evaluation application as you said it takes 3 to 5 days
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, I completely understand your concern here. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Well understood thank you
16/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tiyamike,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 7:06 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: I managed to through a letter
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 7:38 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is $1950 
Standard duration of course is 3 years
Admission processing fee is $200
Registration fee is $500
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as per the offer letter your per semester fee after the scholarship is $975 can you please check?
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes i  have checked,,
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes
17/11/23, 8:22 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: I understand that before joining the university,, the first semester fee should be paid before joining the university,, meaning i will pay registration fee at the same time ,, paying first semester fee while am here my country, is it so?
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265886735577 no for now your focus is just on paying the registration fee which will be adjusted toward your first year tuition fee the remaining fees can be cleared once you arrive in India. May I know if you are clear?
17/11/23, 8:29 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Last time you said registration fee is $750 before scholarship and after scholarship i  will pay $600 - $150,, so now am confused,, on letter registration fee indicates $500 then the last part indicates $700,, may you help me for better understanding
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand the registration fee varies from $500-$750 the admission processing fee is a part of the registration fee which makes your registration fee as $700, and the $150 grant will be explained ahead as we move with our discussion.
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Following
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Following
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes
17/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: This I have understood very well, is it not possible to pay this fee in the month of January as i  asked last time?

And also I understood that i will have examinations from university,,, so the examinations will be written after paying registration fee?
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Following
17/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. Since the offer letter is issued by the university and the deadline is stated as well by the university, if a student is not able to meet the deadline the university shall revoke the offer letter. However, if you keep us informed about your challenges transparently the academic board may consider your reasons and shall provide you an extension if they think that the reason stated is genuine. January is a very long time and the universities will not hold on to your seat for such a long time please and unless and until you register yourself you will not be able to right the exams as well. 

I hope we you are clear now?
17/11/23, 9:13 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Examinations will be written after paying registration fee?
17/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @may be I did not understand your question well, could you please help me understand which examinations are you referring to?
17/11/23, 9:16 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: University entrance examination
17/11/23, 9:18 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: I mentioned a month of January that I will be ready of this ,, this is so due to the challenge of devaluation which we are facing here in African countries.
17/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, I would love to answer however, since it is past our available hours let us reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
17/11/23, 10:11 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Thank you

18/11/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response early since today is Saturday and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
18/11/23, 7:05 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Thank you

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add your father to the group.
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Thank you
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - ~ Tiah🌸 added +265 998 56 65 88
20/11/23, 7:12 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: We are available
20/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes am clear that if a student is not able to meet the deadline the university shall revoke the offer letter. If a student face some challenges the academic board may consider as they think that is genuine, so i don't know if my challenge of devaluation might be a reason that might consider us to pay registration fee in month of January
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will definitely be discussing your concern as we move toward the end of our discussion please do not worry about it and have faith.
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
20/11/23, 8:12 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Last time when i was pay enrollment fee , i did this through a Bank
20/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.
20/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Yes
20/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Right now no any queries
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

20/11/23, 8:48 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Nice to view the videos
20/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that , before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
20/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 22nd of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/11/23, 8:51 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Well understood
20/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please have a great evening ahead.
20/11/23, 8:51 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Thank you
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: You too have a good evening
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you so much.
23/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tiyamike!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
24/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tiyamaike.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Good afternoon, we were unavailable yesterday sorry for that,, we discussed about the offer letter
24/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: My family is very excited upon received the good news as offer letter,   my family also is eager to continue the admission process until we will pay registration fee as the first thing of my higher education journey to India and is there pleasure that this must  be successful and so  adorable
24/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
24/11/23, 4:31 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Right now no any questions
24/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
24/11/23, 4:35 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: I managed to just viewed the videos and pictures shared and also managed to search its Facebook page able to following the university's page
24/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 30, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $275, or you can opt to pay the full $550 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
24/11/23, 4:43 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: As i requested last time that may we pay this fee in month of January
24/11/23, 4:51 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Right now following due date we can't afford due to devaluation challenge we are facing,, but month of January if university accept our request we will pay
24/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that as per the financial preparations that you have in place you have been working to complete the formalities by January 2024 and by then you would be able to make the payment of the entire fee that is due. However, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student. I would want to help you out but this is something that the university would not approve and in that case, even if the university agrees to help you with an extension they would not be able to give you the endowment benefits that have been offered which means that instead of making the payment of $550 you would have to make a payment of $700 now this would further add on the financial burden on your head
24/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To avoid this since you shared your concern with me earlier and on time what I can do is, I can see if it is possible to have a discussion with the Academic Board and make a plan for you and for that I would need to understand, how much have you been able to raise by now and how much will you be able to raise before the 30th of November 2023?
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: My parents say that all amount of money Will pay at mentioned month
24/11/23, 5:28 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: Before admission process continued, i  requested earlier about the payment for registration that may  we  pay in the month of January, and you answered us with hope that no problem you will do, so now some problems arise especially the university that may be can't allow it , if allow us to pay in month of January no scholarship earned and I will pay $700 , so we will here from you how it will goes, but it is my pleasure and my family too to study abroad
24/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
24/11/23, 9:46 pm - +265 886 73 55 77: You too have good night
