I hope you are doing well and thank you for asking, I am doing well. I understand that the network can be challenging. We were not available yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.

The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate.

25/10/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
25/10/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Nokutenda 2K23OCT1306R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
25/10/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Nokutenda EWYL23E0824)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

25/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa added +263 77 709 4369
25/10/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into his academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring his access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 709 4369: We as a family feel so humbled by the accommodative interaction we had so far with all the Edoofa team. We are so impressed as a family. What an opportunity so great that has come our way. Our son is our future and we need him to scale to greater heights. We need him to have hands on in his academic and career path hence we all agreed on the Earn While You Learn program. We were impressed with this program because it develops  and grooms an integral, wholesome personality making the final man a responsible and interlectual being. From the pictures, videos and write-ups posted, the exposure of the  Edoofans is a cut above the rest. We really appreciate the nature and scope of Edoofa approach to academic and career development of the  young and youths into mature future leaders.
25/10/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's heartwarming to hear about your positive experiences and the strong sense of family support for your son's educational journey with us.

25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I can understand that Nokutenda is currently in his exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect his exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, he can enhance his study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit his performance in the upcoming exams.
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and his exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
25/10/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if he is occupied with exams, you as parents on his behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 31st of October, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
25/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa added +263 78 078 0828
25/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Yes Nokutenda is writing his exams. We will take over and do the orientation. We are ready to do so.
25/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, parents can fill out and sign the form on behalf of the student as well. It's important to note that all three of these forms should be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 02:00 p.m. This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, 31st October, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective?

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

27/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please he can share the questions in the form of texts.
27/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 078 0828: I have exam in the afternoon but 4pm is okay for me
27/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I understand, however, you would have tomorrow and Sunday as well and the academic interview questions will take 1 hour of your time, you can do that tomorrow first thing within an hour, and on Monday your parents can share them on your behalf.
30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 292 6729: We are following and it's very clear
30/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 292 6729: It's clear we can proceed
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 292 6729: This is good
We are waiting patiently for the offer letter and start the journey
30/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it was great to meet them finally, may I know if you are excited to see Nokutenda in this picture for next year?
30/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 292 6729: We will be very happy for real
30/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Can't wait for this day
30/10/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 078 0828: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the questions, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Yes I'm available
30/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing may I know if you were able to go through my messages above?
30/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 709 4369: This message was deleted
30/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Okay let me do that
30/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall wait for your respoonse.
31/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Yes we went through the messages.
31/10/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nokutenda.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday and since we were not able to continue with our disucssion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Mom is available
01/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Well explained and clear
01/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Nokutenda, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 292 6729: That's great news for us
01/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Well explained and exiting
01/11/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
01/11/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Yes it does
01/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Hie
01/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Following
01/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Please provide more information
01/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
01/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Sure understood
01/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Right
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 709 4369: That's clear
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 709 4369: This is clear and we agree with that.
01/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Yes please
01/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Yes
01/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
01/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 709 4369: This is clear and we agree on that
01/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Very clear
01/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Nokutenda,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems you haven't had a chance to respond, even though I noticed that you've seen my previous message. Could I please inquire if our connection is still connected?
02/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Sorry we are a bit tied up will be in touch soon
02/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Could you let me know a time by when can be connect?
02/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Around 2pm
02/11/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 02:00 pm.
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Good afternoon
02/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, to you too. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Yes now available
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
02/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Yes we went through it
02/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Nokutenda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
02/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Very excited
02/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
02/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Thank you so much will greet the family. We have our fingers crossed hopefully we will get a place
02/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 709 4369: We are so excited about your package. Everything is highly appreciated. Thank you so much.
17/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 078 0828: Hie
17/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 292 6729: We are well thank you
Still waiting for university offer letters we haven't received any yet
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern, however, we are still waiting for updates from the university once we receive any updates I shall notify you.
17/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Ok thank you
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
17/11/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Nokutenda,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 292 6729: 1. $900
2. 8 semesters 
3. $300
4.$750 <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Yes it's clear
18/11/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Well explained
18/11/23, 8:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Sure it does
18/11/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Yes please. It's clear. Let's move on.
18/11/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Yes, we are together and it's clear so far
18/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Nokutenda, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
18/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 709 4369: Thank for having time with you. We will keep reading the offers. Let's connect on Monday. Good night.
20/11/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nokutenda!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 292 6729: Good morning we are fine  thank you
20/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 292 6729: Can you schedule us after 5pm we are tied up
20/11/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your comfortable time slot with me here please. On that note, I would like to mention that for today, my working hours are till 04.00 PM only, therefore, would it be comfortable for you to connect with me here before that?
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nokutenda!
I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting your acknowledgment to proceed with our discussion earlier yesterday, however, since I did not receive one, we could not move ahead with our discussion here. 

May I know if we can move ahead with our conversation here now?
21/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Good afternoon
Can you reschedule us please we are both busy at work
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask till when are you busy?
21/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 292 6729: End of day today
Tomorrow is ok
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know is it possible that you would be able to connect with me anytime before that?
21/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Can we talk now
21/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 292 6729: Good evening
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nokutenda!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
22/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 292 6729: Good morning
Let's proceed
22/11/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
22/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 292 6729: Yes it's clear
22/11/23, 8:55 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 292 6729: Yes I recall
You can explain further
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 292 6729: Yes it is clear and as a family we are taking the option of paying $300 before 1December the other $300 by 1st January
22/11/23, 9:06 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are willing to take the advantages of the Payment Plan. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 292 6729: Can you explain more
22/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 292 6729: How can we pay if we do not have a foreign currency exchange account
22/11/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 292 6729: We stay in Bindura 
89km from Harare
22/11/23, 9:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 9:17 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 292 6729: Ok thank you we will organize with Mr Rajan so that we can make the payment
22/11/23, 9:22 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/11/23, 9:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles' FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 292 6729: We will discuss as family and inform you on which method we are opting
22/11/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, you can do that. Along with that, if you would plan to make the payment through Mr. Charles, let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
22/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 292 6729: Ok thank you
22/11/23, 9:34 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
22/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 292 6729: How safe is the independent accommodation option for our son
22/11/23, 9:51 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
22/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 292 6729: Sure it does
22/11/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
22/11/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/11/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
22/11/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
22/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 292 6729: Understood
22/11/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
22/11/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
22/11/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
22/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 292 6729: It's very clear
22/11/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
22/11/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 292 6729: I think everything has been explained clearly and we understand
22/11/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
22/11/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

22/11/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that , before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
22/11/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
22/11/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
22/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 292 6729: Perfect
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I would like to share an important update with you here. Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Kirti, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Friday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

24/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Nokutenda!

I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer at Edoofa*, I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
24/11/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 292 6729: yes we did and we also discussed with Milan Singh
