I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Phyllis's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Good  evening 
Network  is our main challenge
20/10/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge, however, please understand that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and we do not wish for Phyllis to be behind her peers, 37 students have already secured their seats with the benefit they had while going through the discussion. So please I would want you to be a little more proactive.
20/10/23, 11:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Phyllis,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 794 4079: We are experiencing network challenges these days but once functional we respond so please kindly bear with us
21/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 794 4079: Network is the barrier nowadays we don't know what is really going on
21/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 794 4079: Otherwise how are you doing
21/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 794 4079: My question is can we proceed while Phyllis is not available  ? If yes let's move on  because Phyllis will be free from the 16th of November after her final exams
21/10/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I understand that the network can be a challenge. Yes it is completely alright as parents you can attend the discussions on her behalf, please.
21/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 794 4079: It's fine we can proceed
21/10/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 794 4079: Downloading of the pic is taking long  will respond once downloaded
21/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 794 4079: Yes I do
21/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 794 4079: Not something new
21/10/23, 11:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 794 4079: The first thing is receiving a  message  from Edoofa ,then secondly a statement of purpose (SOP),thirdly is a counselling session on the University Admission, then after we receive an offer letter from colleges/Universities  then the University registration and acceptance letter and am sure this will be done after paying $850 admission fee which will be deducted from  the first term tuition fee  and lastly Visa Application Process which will be spearheaded by the Edoofa
21/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 794 4079: From this I think you can correct me but if all is well  Clap your hands for me
21/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I can see you have understood really well. However, let me correct you here, the registration fee is $750 and not 850.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 794 4079: Yes thanks for the corrections
21/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 794 4079: Go ahead
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 794 4079: Ok let's move on
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 794 4079: Copied proceed
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Phyllis, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
23/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 794 4079: Morning
23/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 794 4079: What time is our session today?
23/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Phyllis,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
23/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We can connect now, if you are available to connect?
25/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Phyllis,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>

Wish you a good evening.
27/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Phyllis,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 1:12 am - +263 71 794 4079: Yes we're  but as I  said before  last time I was experiencing network challenges now  we are  having  2 network versus power
28/10/23, 1:12 am - +263 71 794 4079: We are all very  willing to continue with you  and we will never retreat
28/10/23, 1:19 am - +263 71 794 4079: But once received your messages obviously we respond
30/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Understood go ahead
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Copied
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Correct
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Well said proceed
30/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Very clear
30/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Noted
30/10/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 331 2932: No queries
30/10/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Very  excited
30/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Noted
30/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 331 2932: Thanks  have a  blessed  day too

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Good afternoon
16/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Shall we start now.
16/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 525 5853: We can continue
16/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Hello
16/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect and yes, that is absolutely correct thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yeah sure l understand that one thanks for clarification
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Okay l got yu but for an option to which accomodation to take l would like to first acknowledge my parents.
But individually l opt to stay at campus.

Do You have any views on the advantages of being off campus
16/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Let say l choose on campus accommodation does this mean that l will pay $3000 including tuition fee.
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, before I help you with your concern could you please help me understand the reason why would your parents want you to go for On-campus accommodation maybe you can help me understand this better?
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Ummm of course l should be starting to take my own responsibility but l think that since I will be in a new environment l would like to start on campus then if l figure out something l will see if l can move out.
Worse still that l had been a boArder since l was in grade 3. So it had been my routine to live on campus.
It's safe also.
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 525 5853: I would like clarification on the$750admission fee.when is it due.
17/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we move ahead we shall be discussing it as well. I would encourage you to be patient.
17/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Since you said the distance is walkable maybe I will see and conclude from my parents views
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Okay 😊
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yes sure LM clear with this one
17/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 525 5853: I think lm  lost l didn't get this clearly
17/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yh sure
17/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 525 5853: But the letter States that the admission fee not registration fee.
And it states that the admission fee is 300
17/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 525 5853: 🤷‍♀️ okay l got you
17/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 525 5853: ☝️
17/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Understood
17/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 525 5853: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.

18/11/23, 12:14 am - +263 71 794 4079: Otherwise how are you
18/11/23, 5:24 am - +263 77 525 5853: All thanks to the Lord.at least you are now feeling well.hoping that I found you well today
Good morning
18/11/23, 8:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Phyllis,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your queries and discuss the letter in detail?
18/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 794 4079: Responding is Her father  can we proceed if possible
18/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 794 4079: Morning
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting  me know that, now coming to your concern from yesterday, please do not worry we are getting to the payment modes only now @263717944079
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 331 2932: We stay in Murambinda,Buhera  distict
18/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 331 2932: Harare is a nearby  town
18/11/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 331 2932: Thank you
18/11/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 9:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi OK Supermart for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 794 4079: So are we done for today to confirm?
18/11/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: No, @263717944079 the discussion is yet to be completed please, however, could you confirm if you would like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 331 2932: You can sent details again.but we opt for Mr Rajan the percentage  is low
18/11/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

18/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 794 4079: Noo thanks I am satiated with the info you  provide above thanks
18/11/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, you can use whichever payment suits you most.
18/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 794 4079: I second this too
18/11/23, 9:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
18/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 794 4079: Copied
18/11/23, 9:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please, let me know once you have taken note of the above breakdown as well.
18/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 794 4079: What if the student is residing in the campus
18/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 331 2932: Yes,
18/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 794 4079: Does the $800 cover food  services?
18/11/23, 9:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, that is absolutely correct.
18/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 331 2932: Noted
18/11/23, 9:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: If a student wishes to reside on campus then the cost of on-campus as explained earlier will be added, in place of off-campus. Our students prefer off-campus because after staying on campus for a month they realize that off-campus is more suitable since they are surrounded by the environment as they were in their home country.
18/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 794 4079: What about Wifi?
18/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 794 4079: Ok understood
18/11/23, 9:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
18/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 331 2932: Better
18/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 794 4079: Thanks for the info all is clear now
18/11/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 794 4079: Yaaaa clearly explained
18/11/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 794 4079: That's really fantastic
18/11/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 794 4079: Aaaa for me everything is clear now  have nothing to ask
18/11/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

18/11/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

18/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

20/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 525 5853: To see if l did understand maybe l can summerize and yu can correct mi wen lm not in the pipeline
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Ummm l can say my tuition fee is $2000 per annum.
My examination fee is $200 per annum.
My program is a 4 year course,making a total of 8 semesters.
I'm supposed to pay a registration fee of $750 which will keep my scholarship seat at Galgotias University and this fee will be  deducted on my first year tuition fee.
This is to be paid in halves since Edoofa will cover up the $150 by Endowment program, l will have to pay the first $300 by 29 November being the first deadline and the remaining$300 by 29 December 2023.
I think I covered up.
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is excellent, you have really understood the process well and are through with our discussions. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Not really....l think l will be working on that as soon as l get a good and reliable internet network.
All l checked on were some of the pictures that you shared with me
20/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
