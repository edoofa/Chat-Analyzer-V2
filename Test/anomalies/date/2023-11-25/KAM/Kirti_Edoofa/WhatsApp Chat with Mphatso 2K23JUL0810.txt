06/10/23, 8:32 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
06/10/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course Maphatso selected for his higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering)  and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2024.

06/10/23, 8:39 pm - +260 97 9935858: Correct

06/10/23, 8:42 pm - +260 97 9935858: For statement of entry, can I share his G12 mock examinations result?
06/10/23, 8:42 pm - +260 97 9935858: And he does not have a passport yet.

06/10/23, 8:46 pm - +260 97 9935858: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the Grade 12 mock exam result, it is duly noted with us.

06/10/23, 9:08 pm - +260 97 9935858: I'd but not so clear. Give me time so that I can scan it during daylight tommorow.
06/10/23, 9:09 pm - +260 97 9935858: For O level Grade 10 Results you have to wait till Monday. I don't have a copy with me.
06/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, it is clear enough, in that case, we shall reconnect on Monday once you have your Mphatso's grade 10 results.
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - +260 97 9935858: Alright, but I had sent in earlier sessions. I hope I manage to contact his previous.
06/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, however since we connected a long time ago due to some technical issues, the old conversation is not available.
06/10/23, 9:18 pm - +260 97 9935858: I see
06/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, let us reconnect on Monday once you have your Mphatso's grade 10 results.
06/10/23, 9:20 pm - +260 97 9935858: No problem
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mphatso.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good evening thanks
09/10/23, 6:14 pm - +260 97 9935858: Just reached home and unfortunately I couldn't get the copy 👆🏽
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, may I know if you were facing any challenges?
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - +260 97 9935858: Yes, it's at his previous School and I'm currently in a different town for work. 
 I have been trying to make arrangements for someone to send a soft copy over to me from the time we communicated.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information. It's understandable that you're making efforts to obtain a soft copy of Mphatso's grade 10 results, even though you're in a different town for work. Having a soft copy can be valuable for various purposes, including scholarship applications. 

So may I know by when will you be able to collect the document?
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - +260 97 9935858: Would you kindly give me upto the end of the week?
09/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, in that case, may I know if you will be able to collect the documents by the 14th of October which is Saturday?
09/10/23, 10:49 pm - +260 97 9935858: I will try
10/10/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mphatso.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that, by the time you responded yesterday it was past our available working hours so we were unable to connect with you. In that case, let us reconnect on 14th of October which is this Saturday at 10:00 am.
12/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Mphatso, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 9935858: Wonderful
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 9935858: It surely does
12/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 97 9935858: I'm following but when exactly are payment expected to be made. Is it next year? If so which month exactly so that it enables us to plan well ahead?
12/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. Let me help you understand. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee which is $750, this fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero. Any other remaining expenses can be cleared once Mphatso arrives in India. 

The registration fee is required to be paid after the university generates the offer letter I hope we are clear now?
12/10/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 9935858: If you share with me estimated dates I will be more grateful. Remember I need to raise that money and pay before the deadline and I can only manage to start paying next year maybe free March 2024. This year won't be possible.
12/10/23, 3:55 pm - +260 97 9935858: I'm saying this due to what I had experienced in the first stage. We need to plan these things as parents too. Once a child completes O levels we usually stay for about a year before starting focusing on paying college or university fees. I understand you have a flexible system but money will still be needed and we will need time to organize it.
12/10/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 9935858: After March 2024
12/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that completely @260979935858 however, let me help you understand that the generation of offer letters depends upon the university please, every university has a different timeline for evaluating the applications and then generating the offer letter which makes it impossible to share the exact dates. 

However, I can help you understand better with an example, (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 15th of October, and so the first deadline becomes the 30th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 30th of November, 2023).

I hope we are clear now?
12/10/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 9935858: This is clear but I'm afraid I may not meet those deadlines. I will need more time to prepare and organize all the requirements.
12/10/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concerns about meeting the deadlines. However, please do not worry, as I mentioned earlier, every university has its own deadline and we will definitely work on a payment plan for you if such a situation occurs stay assured.
12/10/23, 7:57 pm - +260 97 9935858: Noted
12/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 8:11 pm - +260 97 9935858: I'm not aware
12/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 8:17 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - +260 97 9935858: Right
12/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 8:54 pm - +260 97 9935858: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 8:54 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay, following
12/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 9:07 pm - +260 97 9935858: Yes
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay
12/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 9:10 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay
12/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 9:14 pm - +260 97 9935858: If I got you right, you had said $750 then I will be eligible to pay $600 which will be split into 2 installments. Then $150 to be covered by as a grant.
12/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct here.
13/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mphatso.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good afternoon
13/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 9935858: No, I will available on Monday afternoon 17hrs
13/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon! Thank you for letting me know your availability. However, the discussion will only take 5 minutes of your time, if you are available to connect @260979935858
13/10/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 9935858: I'm driving
13/10/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 9935858: You can leave the message if it's possible
13/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I can share the message you can respond at your convenience. As Mohatso's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Mohatso is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Mphatso,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/11/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐ <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 10:02 pm - +260 97 9935858: Thank you so much. I'm really happy for my son.
16/11/23, 10:05 pm - +260 97 9935858: I have two major concerns :
1. Is it possible for the university to change the guardian's names to Tabitha Chilongo? Mr Derrick Lengwe is not part and parcel of this scholarship and neither is helping in anyway to sponsor the student.
16/11/23, 10:10 pm - +260 97 9935858: 2. I feel 30th November is too soon to rise the required amount for the provision registration fee. Is it possible to push it to next year. I think I had indicated in our earlier sessions that we are not in a hurry as parents to send off children to college or university. We are just from paying Secondary school fees and need some breathing space, especially that more finances will be required to settle the university fees. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 10:11 pm - +260 97 9935858: Kindly consider my above concerns or issues before we can proceed further 🙏🏾
16/11/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm and all your concerns will be discussed tomorrow during our discussion please.
16/11/23, 10:22 pm - +260 97 9935858: Well noted
17/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening  Parents and Mphatso,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasi
17/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:10 pm - +260 97 9935858: Thank you so much for offer and consideration. I'm really a proud parent.
17/11/23, 6:11 pm - +260 97 9935858: I surely read through and shared my concerns last night.
17/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 6:15 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay
17/11/23, 6:16 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure, looking forward too
17/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have.

2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?

17/11/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260979935858 as we move ahead we will be explaining each and everything in detail, please do not worry.
18/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mphatso,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 9935858: The response 👆🏾
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good day to you too.
18/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was referring to the response after this statement, however, it is alright please since we are connected now.
20/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mphatso.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good evening thanks, what kind response do you need exactly? I thought we were connected on Saturday 🤷🏽‍♀️ <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - +260 97 9935858: What does that mean 👆🏾
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - +260 97 9935858: The only challenge I have now is communication. You have not responded to my concerns and you keep discontinuing sessions anyhow.
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you might need answers to your queries, as a parent I would have wished for the same however, what I wish is that I help you understand the letter first and thank you for sharing these queries with me I am glad to see that you were able to go through your offer letter and note all of these down rest assured that as we move forward we would be discussing all these queries the purpose of scheduling our discussion today was to help you understand the offer letter better and address any queries that you might have now that you have shared these queries you can be rest assured that these would be covered, please. 

Moving forward I would like to inform you that as we start with our discussion I'll help you understand the letter if at the end there is any query that is unattended then we can cater to that as well. So may I know if you are available to start with the discussion?
20/11/23, 7:17 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - +260 97 9935858: To be paid when?
20/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we will be discussing as we move ahead with our discussion please. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
20/11/23, 7:38 pm - +260 97 9935858: Yes
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +260 97 9935858: Following
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
20/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
20/11/23, 8:00 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
20/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - +260 97 9935858: It's clear
20/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - +260 97 9935858: I don't think I can manage.
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - +260 97 9935858: Please do
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 9935858: Okay, and what happens if you fell to raise the $275 by the 30th, is there any extension?
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - +260 97 9935858: Yes, the challenge is on finances. We never planned to start paying any more school fees this year. How I wish I was informed earlier.
20/11/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please since the deadlines are issued by the universities, if we do not abide by them, the university shall revoke the scholarship offer, however, if the challenges are discussed with us and if the academic board considers them genuine they might help you with extension, for that you would need to be transparent with your concerns.
20/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since you mentioned this, I understand that your finances can be a challenge right now, however, that is the reason why when we connected in July we informed you that the admission process for Mufaro would be starting in the month of August 2024, and you were very clearly even told about the registration fee of $750 in our previous discussions as well.
20/11/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can go through the message and share your thoughts and we will be discussing the same tomorrow at 06:00 pm since our available hours for today are now over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow.
20/11/23, 10:29 pm - +260 97 9935858: The agreement was for him to start school 2024 not paying of school fees
20/11/23, 10:29 pm - +260 97 9935858: Alright
21/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mphatso,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good afternoon thanks. I think 6pm is fine with me.
21/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I will love to continue our discussion at 06:00 pm today. I hope you will be available.
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure

I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 10:34 pm - +260 97 9935858: Sure
22/11/23, 7:50 pm - +260 97 9935858: When is the 45 days counted? Is it from the day you receive the letter offer or after the University deadline
22/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The day when we share the offer letter with you, 15 days for the first deadline and 30 days for the next timeline.
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - +260 97 9935858: Alright thanks
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - +260 97 9935858: It's clear
22/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
22/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
22/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
23/11/23, 1:03 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good afternoon, I only shared with the applicant who will be joining us on the chats later. I'm currently away from home working.

24/11/23, 1:27 pm - +260 97 9935858: I had sent to you on Wednesday
24/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please. Let me share the offer letter with you once again for your convenience.
24/11/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 4172165: Sure
24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me know once you have gone through it once again.
24/11/23, 1:35 pm - +260 97 4172165: I have thank you
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 4172165: I've gone through everything
24/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and you are welcome. Moving forward, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - +260 97 4172165: Yes the Residential facilities
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - +260 97 4172165: How conducive are they and is are the residential fees covered in the $700 ?
24/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

24/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
24/11/23, 1:50 pm - +260 97 4172165: Oh I totally understand that
24/11/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 4172165: Thank you for briefing me
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 30, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $275, or you can opt to pay the full $550 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 4172165: I'm not too sure which one is suitable for my Guardians  but I'll be sure to let you know once I've spoken with them
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let us wait for @260979935858 to respond to this.
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - +260 97 4172165: Sure thing
24/11/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for him to respond, till then have a great day ahead.
24/11/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 4172165: Thank you and you too
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - +260 97 9935858: We will pay the $550 by 30th December. Unfortunately I can't manage to raise any money this mothend. Notice was too short.
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. I completely understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in December last or January next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment since your first deadline stands on 30th November so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted Mphatso to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 9935858: I read this clearly, remember you shared with me already, and how I  wish you had guided that we should keep such amounts of money in November this year then maybe we could have saved enough to avoid this.
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 9935858: If it is not possible to make payment in December then I'm afraid there is nothing else I can do. Like I just 15 days is too short to raise such an amount. Mphatso just came back from school a few days ago and that also costed me.
24/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
24/11/23, 9:37 pm - +260 97 4172165: Alright
