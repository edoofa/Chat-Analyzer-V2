17/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Sagar, and he did brief me about Luyando's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
17/08/23, 8:14 pm - +260 97 6786186: The counseling sessions where very educative. I got to learn alot about Edoofa. It is a program I had no knowledge about until the school (Ibenga Girls )mentioned it. 
What I liked most about it is that the program aims at offering affordable education through scholarships. And also that students get to earn while they learn in a way helping pay for their education .
17/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I’m delighted to know that you had such a great experience, I can clearly see that now you have a great understanding of the program and indeed through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
17/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

18/08/23, 2:46 pm - +260 97 6786186: From the four videos I was able to get that with earn while you learn program, students become or blossom into independent individuals 
_Open minded and following instructions are the two tools for one to  successful in the Edoofa program 
_ Edoofa treats every student with much care and respect 
_Through the Edoofa program scholarships and education are made affordable 
_Edoofa acts as a parent  which offers guidance and mentorship to students into achieving greater success

_ I also learnt the Edoofa triangle, altitude, skills and knowledge. 
_Students are offered community bases services and capacity building skills under the edoofa program so that they are able to fit in the community
18/08/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 6786186: I also learnt about the important documents to submit during applications.  These are the 
Student documents 
Recommendation from counseling sessions 
Statement of purpose
18/08/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/08/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/08/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing great and had a wonderful day, may I know if you are available to connect so that we can move forward with the discussion, I would also like to inform you that please respond to the messages rather than reacting to them, since we are unable to know that and then our discussions get delayed.

I hope we are clear here?
18/08/23, 7:59 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted and am available
18/08/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
18/08/23, 8:03 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
18/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 01.00 pm.
18/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

21/08/23, 11:08 am - +260 97 6786186: Good morning. Kindly accept answers from the last questions given.
21/08/23, 11:12 am - +260 97 6786186: Q2.  What are macro nutrients and give examples.
Macro nutrients are types of foods/ nutrients required in large amounts in the diet. They are different types of macro nutrients and these are;
i.	Carbohydrates: these are compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They provide energy that is used for different metabolic reactions in the body and hence are referred to as energy giving foods. Carbohydrates are classified into 3 groups namely:
a.	Monosaccharides: these are the simplest form of carbohydrates. Glucose, fructose and galactose are common examples of a monosaccharides.
b.	Disaccharides: these are carbohydrates formed by linking two monosaccharides through the process of condensation. Sucrose, maltose and lactose are common examples of disaccharides.
c.	Polysaccharides: these are complex carbohydrates formed by linking many monosaccharides together. Starch, cellulose and glycogen are common examples are polysaccharides. 

ii.	Lipids (fats and oils): these are organic molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They allow the body to store energy. Sources of fats are avocadoes, red meat, butter, cheese, fish, full fat milk etc.

iii.	Proteins: these have the same elements as carbohydrates in addition to nitrogen and phosphorous and Sulphur. They are referred to as nitrogenous compounds because of the presence of nitrogen. Proteins are made of small units called amino acids. Amino acids occur naturally and are grouped into two as follows: 
a. Essential amino acids: these are amino acids which cannot be synthesized by the body
 b. non-essential amino acids: these are amino acids that can be synthesized by the body. 

Proteins are classified into two classes namely: 
a. First class proteins: this group contains all essential amino acids. They include animal proteins and soya beans. 
b. Second class proteins: this group lacks one or more essential amino acids. They include plant proteins such as beans and peas.

3.	Vitamins: these are groups of related substances present in small amounts in the food stuffs and are necessary for the body to function normally. They are classified into two groups namely:

a.	Fat soluble vitamins: these are vitamins that are soluble in fats and fat solvents. They are insoluble in water. Vitamins A, D, E and K are examples are fat soluble vitamins.
b.	Water soluble vitamins: are soluble in water and so cannot be stored in the body. Vitamins B, C and folic acid are common examples of water-soluble vitamins.


Q3. What are enzymes and what are the factors that affect the enzyme activity?
  
Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living cells. They are required in small amounts and can be used repeatedly. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy. They are several factors that affect enzyme activity some of which are: 
a)	Temperature: each enzyme has an optimum temperature at which its works best. A higher temperature generally results in an increase in enzyme activity. Lower temperature usually inactivates the enzyme.

b)	The pH: each enzyme has an optimal Ph that helps maintain its shape. Changes in shape may denature enzymes by altering the enzymes activation site.

c)	The concentration of enzyme: If a sufficient concentration of enzymes is available, increasing enzyme concentration will increase the enzyme reaction rate.

d)	The concentration of substrate: at a constant enzyme concentration and at lower concentrations of substrate, the substrate concentration is a limiting factor. As the substrate concentration increases, the enzyme reaction rate also increases. However, at very high substrate concentrations, the enzymes become saturated with substrate and a higher concentration of substrate does not increase the reaction rate.

Q4. Which are the different types of vitamins, give an example of their source?
Vitamins are organic compounds found in natural foods which are required for normal growth and maintenance of the body. Both humans and animals require vitamins for their growth. Vitamins are of two types: 
a)	Fat – soluble: which are dissolved in fat.
b)	Water – soluble: which are dissolved in water. 
They are different types of vitamins. Some of which are:
a)	Vitamin A which is a fat-soluble vitamin. It can be found in green leafy plants.
b)	Vitamin B1(thiamine) which a water-soluble vitamin. It can be found in fresh fruits etc.
c)	Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) which is a water-soluble vitamin. It can be found in bananas etc.
d)	Vitamin B3 (Niacin) which is a water-soluble vitamin. It can be found in meat, fish, eggs etc
e)	Vitamin C which is also a water-soluble vitamin. It can be found in fresh fruits etc.
f)	Vitamin D which is a fat-soluble vitamin. It can be found in fish, eggs etc.
g)	Vitamin E which is a fat-soluble vitamin. It can be found in potatoes etc.
h)	Vitamin K which is a fat-soluble vitamin. It can be found in tomatoes etc.
Q5. Define hormones. Classify them with examples.
Hormones are chemical substances produced in the ductless glands and are carried to different parts of the body by the blood stream where they control various metabolic processes in the body. Hormones are classified into three categories which are:
a.	Lipid derived hormones: they are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar. The primary class of these hormones are steroid hormones such as testosterone, estrogen etc.

b.	Amino acid derived hormones: these are small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine. An example of an amino acid derived hormone is thyroxine which is produced by the thyroid gland.

c.	Peptide hormones: are a chain of amino acids also known as polypeptide. These hormones also include molecules that are short polypeptide chains such as the antidiuretic hormone produced in the brain. It also includes small proteins like growth hormones produced by the pituitary gland and large proteins such as the follicle stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland.

21/08/23, 1:37 pm - +260 97 6786186: Very clear
21/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
21/08/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
21/08/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
21/08/23, 1:53 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted
21/08/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
21/08/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 6786186: I think for now my question on cost. How much will it cost
21/08/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand your question better and what cost are you referring to since the cost breakdown was explained to you right now in the above messages?
21/08/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 6786186: Sorry want to ask on the time frame for paying the $750.
21/08/23, 2:00 pm - +260 97 6786186: Approximately how mich time in average is given fr the admission fee to be paid
21/08/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The registration fee of $750 is to be paid within the deadline of two weeks. However, each university has its own deadline period but to be on the safer side we always consider the deadline period of two weeks so that the parent/student/ guardian is prepared mentally and financially accordingly. 

I hope we are clear?
21/08/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted
21/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to have a family discussion of the financial requirements so you can work in the right direction on them. Since Luyando's university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then you will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
21/08/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 6786186: Thankx so much
21/08/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

09/09/23, 8:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Luyando,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Luyando's higher education?

13/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I am aware of that, hence there must have been a statement of entry shared by the school which states the examination dates for each subjects?

13/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, I shall wait for your response.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing end term results and the statement of entry, it is duly noted with us. Let us reconnect today at 08:30 am for our further discussion.
14/10/23, 7:37 am - +260 97 6786186: Morning. Noted
14/10/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @260976786186 with regard to our conversation I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now?
14/10/23, 10:18 am - +260 97 6786186: Good morning
14/10/23, 10:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings again, may I know if you are available now to connect with us?
14/10/23, 10:54 am - +260 97 6786186: Am available now
14/10/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biochemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
14/10/23, 11:13 am - +260 97 6786186: Correct
14/10/23, 11:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:33 am - +260 97 6786186: Yes I do
14/10/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
14/10/23, 11:50 am - +260 97 6786186: Step 1 : here you find designed series of videos for students to have more clarity in being an Edoofan.  What qualities are needed for one to be an Edoofan and also one aligning with the Edoofa vision, getting to know the schools, as well as universities under Edoofa. Also knowing the importance of the Statement of purpose.

Step 2: Statement of Purpose
This a subjective document which allows one the convince admission board or any school of why they are worthy of scholarship or admission in school. The documents also indicates ones achievements, unique traits, abilities, goals,vision, academic progress etc.

Step3: this is the counseling sessions on school selection and achieving maximum scholarships.

Step 4:offer letter from
 universities
Based of the 3 above steps, the admissions team now sends applications to multiple universities for evaluation and the admission process and based on that, the offer letter would be issued
14/10/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
14/10/23, 12:16 pm - +260 97 6786186: All is clear
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with the Admission process for the year 2024?
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 6786186: Yes am ready
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/10/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted
14/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/10/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 6786186: Proceed
14/10/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, grade 12 results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Luyando, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 6786186: Great
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Luyando,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
16/10/23, 5:04 pm - +260 97 6786186: Good afternoon. Been extremely busy. I understood  our last decision
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you must be busy with work and I am glad to hear that you are clear with our last discussion. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion now?
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 6786186: I can proceed
16/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
16/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 5:17 pm - +260 97 6786186: No am not
16/10/23, 5:18 pm - +260 97 6786186: Provide more information
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement. <This message was edited>

16/10/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Luyando,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 12:38 pm - +260 97 6786186: Hello
17/10/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 6786186: I had asked for more information and that's what you provided.
17/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260976786186 thank you for sharing that, I would have surely done that, however, here I asked a question about which I wanted to know if you are aware or not and the message was not acknowledged by that time, hence I did not want to move forward without your active involvement, please.

We can move ahead now if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - +260 97 6786186: We can move am available
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - +260 97 6786186: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 1:11 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
17/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 1:25 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - +260 97 6786186: Ok
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 6786186: We can proceed am clear
17/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Luyando's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Luyando is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 1:37 pm - +260 97 6786186: Super excited for this
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/10/23, 5:44 am - +260 97 6786186: Am a proud Edoofan
21/10/23, 8:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Luyando.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
21/10/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 6786186: Good morning.  Not at all

20/11/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted then.
20/11/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 6786186: Will be available

20/11/23, 6:34 pm - +260 97 6786186: Evening
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you today. May I know if you were able to go through this message above?
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - +260 97 6786186: I did and asked a question on Saturday
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please and I did respond to your query as well here.
20/11/23, 6:44 pm - +260 97 6786186: Yes I was pointing out that I read through
20/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know when will you be able to respond to the above queries.
20/11/23, 6:49 pm - +260 97 6786186: Registration is $750
Tuition is $1315
Course is 3years duration
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - +260 97 6786186: Clear now. Thought accommodation comes with the scholarship
20/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain this concern. The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
20/11/23, 7:20 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - +260 97 6786186: Great
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - +260 97 6786186: Ok
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Luyando's total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund
20/11/23, 7:28 pm - +260 97 6786186: Understood
20/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Luyando with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
20/11/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
20/11/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - +260 97 6786186: Reasonable for both ways
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as November 29, 2023.
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
20/11/23, 7:43 pm - +260 97 6786186: Thought it's supposed to be paid once the student comes there and besides am still waiting to look at other universities as we
20/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
20/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/11/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the PDM and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - +260 97 6786186: Noted.  Will surely wait.
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand even better, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - +260 97 6786186: Understood.
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - +260 97 6786186: Am seeking permission to.get back to my studies now.
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let me just explain the transfer option to you and then we can connect tomorrow at the same time?
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - +260 97 6786186: Ok
20/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to PDM to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for PDM, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/11/23, 8:04 pm - +260 97 6786186: Ok
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please may I know if you are clear now?
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - +260 97 6786186: Am clear. Should I have more questions I will lave them here for your attention
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us reconnect tomorrow since you have to study now.
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - +260 97 6786186: Thankx
20/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great evening ahead.

I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following our previous discussions. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 12:50 pm - +260 97 6786186: Afternoon.  Over the weekend will be better
24/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260976786186 I hope you are aware that we are not available during the weekends, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 6786186: Afternoon. Let's connect at 17 upto 18. If it's fine
24/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is alright, I am looking forward to connecting at 05:00 pm with you.
24/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if we are still connected?
24/11/23, 7:55 pm - +260 97 6786186: Evening. Was waiting at 05:00pm
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, I believe it was a misunderstanding from both the ends, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
24/11/23, 8:00 pm - +260 97 6786186: Am here
24/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of November 29, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of December 29, 2023 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 29 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +260 97 6786186: Following
24/11/23, 8:31 pm - +260 97 6786186: Am having network issues
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge.  Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
