12/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Vongai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Vongai's higher education?

11/10/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Vongai.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/10/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Vongai.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you yesterday, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
14/10/23, 10:58 am - +27 73 679 6781: Fine and you
14/10/23, 11:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm pleased to hear that you're doing well, and thank you for asking; I'm also doing great. I understand the challenges of securing the necessary finances for Vongai's education. I recall our previous conversation about your plans to start your own business. I'm curious to know how things are progressing with that venture.
14/10/23, 11:59 am - +27 73 679 6781: Yes. But now i waiting  for hie results to come. And then i can see which i can do. But I'm willing him to go forward if possible
14/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can definitely move ahead and for the results, you do not have to worry I have a piece of exciting news to share as we move ahead with the discussion. Before we start, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
14/10/23, 12:05 pm - +27 73 679 6781: All documents you you have it. Only A level which I'm waiting for. Once it comes i give you
14/10/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please could you please let me know by when will you be able to get the statement of entry for A- level?
14/10/23, 12:25 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Feb next year.
14/10/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the A- level result, and I am aware of that hence you can share the statement of entry for A- level because most of the students have them from now.

16/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Vongai,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes. Last time we discuss untill to the last step where i pay $200 and i stop there
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $500- $750 registration fee is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
16/10/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Vongai,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 2:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Not yet discussed.
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let us discuss now if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Vongai.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, you did not respond, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 73 836 0751: Afternoon sir , sorry I was in an exam .
18/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. May I know if you or your parents are available to connect with us now?
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Now i available
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I agree. But application we done it last time. Can i applying again or you must use same application
18/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do not worry, the same application is being under process and you do not have to apply again, and I am starting the discussion with our previous discussion so that you recall the steps since it has been a long time
18/10/23, 8:51 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. So from where we  end what's next.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In our past discussions, we were to discuss the per annum cost break down and we shall now get there as well, please I would encourage you to be patient.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - +27 73 679 6781: They explain. But they is one question i asked. They not answer me. The question is since vongai she is writing now. How can i pay all money before l get his results. Me i see is why's to pay after results come out.
18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern here @27736796781 as I mentioned earlier, as we move ahead to step 4 your concern shall be answered, I just appreciate you being a little patient, please.
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - +27 73 679 6781: So to be in step 4 is there any payment i must do or not
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, @27736796781 to reach step 4 there is no payment required, after step 4 you would be getting offer letters and that is the time you need to prepare just to register yourself with the university, we shall discuss this in detail now, may I know if you are ready?
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Im ready
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes I'm clear
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 9:15 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
18/10/23, 9:16 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I understand it.
18/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
18/10/23, 9:19 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
18/10/23, 9:23 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes we are together
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
18/10/23, 9:33 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I understand
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I don't  have queries about it
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - +27 73 679 6781: So nice
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, I hope you are excited to see Vongai in this picture for next year?
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes. So can we continue tomorrow because i start to work now.
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, yes we can continue tomorrow, so may I know if you will be able to connect tomorrow at 12:30  pm?
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Vongai.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?
20/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Vongai,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. We were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Vongai's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, may I know if we are still connected?
20/10/23, 8:12 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I'm still connected but  iwas bezy
20/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you are available to move ahead?
20/10/23, 8:15 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Now im driving lets see tomorrow
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, please understand that this absence has been having a negative impact on Vongai's scholarship, I hope you are aware that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and these delays will put Vongai behind the peers, which is not a good sign.
20/10/23, 11:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Vongai,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 8:25 am - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
21/10/23, 8:30 am - +27 73 679 6781: I'm available now. For any hour.
21/10/23, 8:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know that you are available. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 8:45 am - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
21/10/23, 8:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 8:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 8:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 8:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 8:51 am - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
21/10/23, 8:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 8:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 8:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Vongai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 8:56 am - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
21/10/23, 8:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 8:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 8:59 am - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
21/10/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 9:32 am - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
21/10/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 9:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 9:48 am - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
21/10/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 9:50 am - +27 73 679 6781: Provide me. But now i start to be bezy
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 9:08 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
21/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Sorry i was bezy on that time
23/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Vongai,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Vongai,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes during the evening i we be free after 21:00
26/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09:00 pm.
26/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings with regard to our conversation may I know if you are ready to connect with us now?
26/10/23, 10:09 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes I'm  ready
26/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
26/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 10:16 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes i understand that as you explain last time. You said we can give him chance to rewrite again
26/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 10:19 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
26/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 10:24 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
26/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 10:29 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
26/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 10:34 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Im understand it
26/10/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 10:36 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
26/10/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 10:38 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Know queries
26/10/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Vongai's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Vongai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 10:45 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
26/10/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/10/23, 10:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
14/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Vongai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

14/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
15/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected for the discussion?
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes I'm  free now
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I need to go step by step as we discussed
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - +27 73 679 6781: 1.1800.
2.5 years
3. 100
4.300
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, however, for question 1 could you please let me know the per-semester fee after the scholarship for question 3 please refer to the university fee structure point 4 and for the last question please refer to page 2 of the offer letter and let me know the response.
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - +27 73 679 6781: 1. 900.
3.1800
4.750
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes im clear
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - +27 73 679 6781: I understood that
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - +27 73 679 6781: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok so whichone on these 3 have got good security to the student.
15/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Both the accommodations have good security however, our Edoofians prefer to stay off- campus since it more cheaper and gives them the freedom to cook for themselves as they want.
15/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok its clear now.
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +27 73 679 6781: We are together. But endowment fee i pay 200 last time. Can i toup 100 to make it 300. Isn't it
15/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27736796781 what you are referring to is the enrollment fee and the fee mentioned is the registration fee. The $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. So i must pay that 750. Before I'm not finish that 300.
15/11/23, 9:02 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Now I'm busy. We can proceed tomorrow
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand both the amounts are different please, the $150 that you are yet to pay your career counselor will be helping you with the due date for that, however, the $750 is the university registration fee, which you have to focus inorder to reserve Vongai's seat with the university. 

May I know if you are clear now?
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you might be busy, and occupied however, could you please let me know if tomorrow 06:00 pm will be fine for you to connect with us?
15/11/23, 9:35 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes on that time i will  be ok to continue.
15/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. Have a good night
15/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you have a great night to you too.
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Vongai.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if we can connect now with regards to our conversation yesterday?
16/11/23, 9:09 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Good evening. Sorry i was busy. We can proceed tomorrow after six.
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 06:00 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 7:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Vongai.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier as I was not feeling well, however, I am doing better so I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Vongai.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you regarding the acknowledgment of the above messages, however, you did not respond may I know if we are still connected?
20/11/23, 1:10 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes. But from 1830hr l we be free
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please let us reconnect today at 06:30 pm CAT I hope you will be available.
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok.
20/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/11/23, 8:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Good evening. Now I'm  free lets discuss
20/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes can explain
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Yes is clear. But if i fail to pay on november i cna pay anyday before 28 december. Is it right
20/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please since the deadlines are issued by the universities, if we do not abide by them, the university shall revoke the scholarship offer, however, if the challenges are discussed with us and if the academic board considers them genuine they might help you with extension, for that you would need to be transparent with your concerns.
20/11/23, 9:25 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. I understood it.
20/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 9:33 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Mostly me i stay in south africa. If I'm in zimbabwe i stay in gokwe
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 9:36 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. Sir i get in touch with him.
20/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.
20/11/23, 9:41 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok. Can you send mama money again so that i can see whichone is better to use. Sametimes i can pay here in south africa. If i fail to go to zimbabwe
20/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since you are planning to make the payments in parts, here is what you can do: visit the Mama Money agent you went to last time and provide them with the following details for the payment:

- Beneficiary Name: Avreen Singh
- Bank Name: ICICI Bank
- Savings Account Number: 055201503452
- IFSC Code: ICIC0000552
20/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:45 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
20/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 9:48 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok
20/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 10:01 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Ok.
20/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 10:05 pm - +27 73 679 6781: Is good becaus its reduce other costs
20/11/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 10:13 pm - +27 73 679 6781: No querie now.
20/11/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
